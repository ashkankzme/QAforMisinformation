[{"article": "PROVIDENCE, R.I. [Brown University] -- To the tantalizing delight of chocolate lovers everywhere, a number of recent studies employing various methods have suggested that compounds in cocoa called flavanols could benefit cardiovascular health. Now a systematic review and meta-analysis of 19 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of cocoa consumption reveals some further pieces of supporting evidence.\n\nThe meta-analysis in the Journal of Nutrition, an assessment of the combined evidence from all 19 RCTs, focused on whether consumption of flavanol-rich cocoa products was associated with improvements in specific circulating biomarkers of cardiometabolic health as compared to consuming placebos with negligible cocoa flavanol content. In all, 1,139 volunteers were involved in these trials.\n\n\"Our meta-analysis of RCTs characterizes how cocoa flavanols affect cardiometabolic biomarkers, providing guidance in designing large, definitive prevention trials against diabetes and cardiovascular disease in future work,\" said corresponding author Dr. Simin Liu, professor and director of the Center for Global Cardiometabolic Health at Brown University who worked with epidemiology graduate student and lead author Xiaochen Lin. \"We found that cocoa flavanol intake may reduce dyslipidemia (elevated triglycerides), insulin resistance and systemic inflammation, which are all major subclinical risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases.\"\n\nLiu noted some limitations in the trials. All studies were small and of short duration, not all of the biomarkers tracked in these studies changed for the better, and none of the studies were designed to test directly whether cocoa flavanol consumption leads to reduced cases of heart attacks or type 2 diabetes.\n\nBut taking into account some of these heterogeneities across studies, the team's meta-analysis summarizing data from 19 trials found potential beneficial effects of flavanol-rich cocoa on cardiometabolic health. There were small-to-modest but statistically significant improvements among those who ate flavanol-rich cocoa product vs. those who did not.\n\nThe greatest effects were seen among trial volunteers who ate between 200 and 600 milligrams of flavanols a day (based on their cocoa consumption). They saw significant declines in blood glucose and insulin, as well as another indicator of insulin resistance called HOMA-IR. They also saw an increase in HDL, or \"good,\" cholesterol. Those consuming higher doses saw some of the insulin resistance benefits and a drop in triglycerides, but not a significant increase in HDL. Those with lower doses of flavanols only saw a significant HDL benefit.\n\nIn general, Lin said, where there were benefits they were evident for both women and men and didn't depend on what physical form the flavanol-rich cocoa product was consumed in --dark chocolate vs. a beverage, for example.\n\n\"The treatment groups of the trials included in our meta-analysis are primarily dark chocolate -- a few were using cocoa powder-based beverages,\" Lin said. \"Therefore, the findings from the current study apparently shouldn't be generalized to different sorts of chocolate candies or white chocolates, of which the content of sugar/food additives could be substantially higher than that of the dark chocolate.\"\n\nThe authors therefore concluded, \"Our study highlights the urgent need for large, long-term RCTs that improve our understanding of how the short-term benefits of cocoa flavanol intake on cardiometabolic biomarkers may be translated into clinical outcomes.\"\n\nIn addition to Lin and Liu, the study's other authors are Isabel Zhang, Alina Li from Brown University, JoAnn Manson, Howard Sesso and Lu Wang from Brigham and Women's Hospital.\n\nThe authors acknowledge funding from the National Institutes of Health including the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, the American Heart Association, and Pfizer.

However, some quantification was needed here and there was no attempt made to add any.

Among the most dispensed: eat a healthy diet, keep a healthy weight, avoid alcohol and tobacco and stay away from certain medications, such as blood pressure and depression drugs.\n\nNow, researchers publishing in the journal have found that another lifestyle change\u2014exercise\u2014may also help improve sperm quality.\n\nIn the study, Behzad Maleki at Justus-Liebig University in Germany and his colleagues recruited 280 sedentary, middle-aged men and randomly assigned them to one of three exercise regimens, or to no exercise, and followed them for six months. They wanted to see what effect different types of exercise, and different intensity activity, had on sperm quality and count. One group exercised at moderate levels continuously by walking or jogging on a treadmill, while another followed the same protocol but at a higher intensity. Another group did high intensity exercise on the treadmill but in short interval bouts.\n\nCompared to the control group that didn\u2019t exercise, all of the men who followed a physical activity program showed improvements in a variety of measures of their sperm. After six months, they showed less DNA damage, healthier sperm shape and lower levels of metabolic stress factors. They also showed higher numbers of sperm precursors.\n\n\u201cThis fits reasonably well with what we thought about the effects of exercise,\u201d says Dr. Peter Schlegel, vice president of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine and chairman of urology at New York Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. \u201cBut this is a much better done study than almost anything that\u2019s been done before on the subject.\u201d He notes that most previous studies did not randomly assign people to exercise groups and compare the outcome on sperm quality, but rather recorded sperm measures among men who reported their exercise habits after the fact.\n\nIn the current study, the men in the moderate intensity, continuous activity program showed the most improvements compared to men in the other two more intense groups. While it\u2019s not entirely clear why, part of the reason may have to do with the fact that extreme exercise generates body heat, which can be detrimental to sperm health; for marathoners and people training at intense levels, finding ways to dissipate body heat is a major concern. Schlegel also says that regular exercise can improve circulation and make the blood vessels healthier, which may benefit the testes, an organ that\u2019s sensitive to and requires good blood flow.\n\nExercise may also be working in other ways to enhance reproductive health, since all of the men who exercised lost weight, reduced their amount of body fat and improved their fitness levels. Fat tissue has been linked to higher levels of damaging metabolic stress compounds, so losing weight and becoming more fit may create more hospitable conditions for sperm and improve its quality and volume.\n\nThere are already plenty of reasons to exercise, and now better quality sperm is one more worth noting.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "There was no quantification of benefits provided in this story, only a statement that \u201call of the men who followed a physical activity program showed improvements in a variety of measures of their sperm,\u201d compared to those men who were in the non-exercise group.

About 70 percent of smokers give up the daunting effort during the first week of trying.\n\nThe researchers, led by Caryn Lerman, a professort of psychiatry, divided 1,246 subjects into slow metabolizers of nicotine and normal metabolizers of the addictive chemical, based on the length of time it took for them to rid their bodies of the drug. The ratio of two metabolites, or byproducts, of the body's processing of nicotine allows easy identification of the two groups. The metabolite is found in blood and saliva.\n\nThe results of the comparison showed that slow metabolizers did just as well on a nicotine patch or the drug varenicline (marketed as Chantix), a drug that works on the nicotine receptors in the brain. But the patch costs less and has fewer side-effects than varenicline (including nausea, difficulty sleeping and abnormal dreams), so the researchers concluded that slow metabolizers should be put on the patch.\n\nNormal metabolizers of nicotine, meanwhile, had more success with varenicline because they tend to rid their systems of nicotine faster, limiting the effectiveness of the patch. Varenicline contains no nicotine.\n\n\"The slower metabolizers, they do very well with the patch. And they get no incremental benefit from varenicline,\" Lerman said in an interview. \"Why spend the money? Why have the side-effects?\"\n\nThis may seem like common sense, but no one had ever tested it before, she said. And given how difficult it is to kick the habit, smokers need all the help they can get to succeed the first time they try, Lerman said.\n\n\"Each time somebody fails, it affects their self confidence,\" Lerman said. \"The trial and error approach is not optimal.\"\n\nResearchers did not test nicotine gum because it delivers a less consistent flow of nicotine to the user, she said. The patch, worn on the skin, delivers a steady flow of the drug, she said.\n\nIn some of the test groups, overall success rates were fairly low, Lerman noted, but the study was conducted during the Great Recession, a time when financial stress may have depressed the chances of succeeding for everyone, regardless of which approach was used.\n\nThis post has been updated.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Great to see a story addressing the effectiveness of pills vs. patches.

Eighty percent of men in the group had PSA levels below that threshold.\n\nIn this group of men, the higher the PSA level at baseline, the more likely the person was to develop prostate cancer and to die of the disease. Only 1.8 percent of men with PSA scores below 1.0 were diagnosed with prostate cancer, with only 0.04 percent dying of the disease. This compares with 15.7 percent of those with scores from 2 percent to 2.9 percent developing a malignancy and 0.36 percent dying of the disease.\n\n\"This gives us some confidence that annual PSA screening is going to soon become a thing of the past,\" said Dr. Nicholas J. Vogelzang, chair of the Developmental Therapeutics Committee of US Oncology, who moderated the teleconference. \"A low PSA, particularly those in men who have less than 1.0, and probably those less than 2.0, certainly could be considered for substantially longer intervals of PSA screening... Personalization of PSA screening is clearly underway.\"\n\nA second study also being presented at the symposium found that a drug already used to treat enlarged prostate gland may delay the progression of low-risk, early prostate cancer among men who choose a wait-and-see approach to treatment.\n\nIn comparison to men with low-risk, early-stage prostate cancer who took a placebo, \"men randomized to receive Avodart saw their chance of progression significantly reduced, by approximately 40 percent,\" said study author Dr. Neil Fleshner, head of urology at the University Health Network and Love Chair in Prostate Cancer Prevention at Princess Margaret Hospital, both in Toronto. \"Men with low-risk prostate cancer who want to have a period of observation should consider using this drug.\"\n\nBut the maker of Avodart (dutasteride), GlaxoSmithKline, is unlikely to apply for new approval to market the drug for what is essentially prevention, meaning it would be used off-label in this context, he added.\n\nA final study of almost 4,000 patients found that surgeons needed to perform 1,600 procedures known as robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomies (RALP) to become adept at the procedure.

The results of this pilot study, published in the peer-reviewed journal European Neuropsychopharmacology, suggest that this may become an effective medical treatment for patients with cocaine addiction, although a larger trial is needed to confirm the initial findings.\n\nCocaine use is widespread in the Western World. Last year, 2.3 million young Europeans (aged 15 to 34) used cocaine, and the US National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates that 1.4 million Americans suffer from cocaine addiction1. There is no effective drug treatment for cocaine addiction, with behavioural therapies being the main element of any treatment regime. Now a group of researchers working in Italy and the USA have shown in a preliminary clinical study that cocaine use can be reduced by treatment with rTMS (repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation).\n\nAs author, Dr Antonello Bonci (Scientific Director, National Institute on Drug Abuse, and Adjunct Professor, John Hopkins University, Baltimore) said:\n\n\"Despite the fact that more than 20 million people worldwide suffer from cocaine use disorders2, there are no effective neurobiological treatments for patients with this devastating condition\".\n\nThe practical work was conducted by team of scientists led by Dr Luigi Gallimberti, from the University of Padova Medical School, Italy, who enrolled 32 patients who were seeking treatment for cocaine addiction at the hospital clinic. The participating patients were randomized to receive either rTMS or standard symptom-relieving medications.\n\nThe experimental group received one rTMS session per day for five days, and then once a week for the following three weeks, for a total of 8 TMS sessions over 29 days. Those in the control group received pharmacological treatment for symptoms associated with cocaine addiction (such as depression, anxiety and sleep problems). The study indicated the safety of rTMS in patients with cocaine addiction. There was significantly less craving and there were a significantly higher number of cocaine-free urine drug tests in the rTMS compared to the control group. In addition, 69% (11/16) patients) in the experimental group showed no relapse to cocaine use, whereas only 19% (3/16) patients) in the control group showed a similar positive result (the results are adjusted for patients who dropped out of the trial).\n\nDr Bonci said: \"rTMS is a non-invasive and very safe therapeutic approach which is used with other mental health and neurological conditions, such as depression and neuropathic pain. Our study suggests that rTMS may also represent a new treatment for patients with cocaine use disorder\".\n\nAt the end of the first 29 days of the experiment, the experimental group was given the option of continuing the treatment, whereas those in the control group were given the possibility of receiving the same rTMS treatment as the experimental group for 63 days. Results further confirmed the beneficial effects of rTMS in helping patients to maintain abstinence from cocaine.\n\nDr. Bonci continued: We consider this study promising but preliminary. We need to replicate the work in a bigger group of patients using sham-TMS as the control condition. As far as we know, this work represents the first clinical report indicating that rTMS treatment results in significant reduction in cocaine use. It is also important to emphasize that, in this study patients were seeking treatment for their cocaine addiction in a hospital setting: the group studied, albeit small, was a \"real world\" sample. We have continued to follow patients from the trial, and the improvement seems to be sustained over time, up to 12 months, although we don't have any hard data on that yet. It is important that this is taken forward to a larger trial.\n\nWe decided to target an area of the brain involved in decision making, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DL PFC). This was because previous animal studies from our lab had shown that compulsive cocaine-seeking was associated with hypoactivity in the prelimbic cortex, which is a brain area that shares similar behavioural roles to the DL PFC. Importantly, we had found that increasing the activity in the prelimbic cortex could significantly reduce cocaine self-administration\".\n\n\"This study represents a creative approach to a disorder that is notoriously difficult to treat in the real world. These pilot data also show that biological treatments nowadays reach far beyond medications and that new neuroscience methods may be used for targeted changes in brain regions relevant for complex mental disorders\".", "question": "Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The release does an adequate job of pointing to improvements in both a reduction of drug cravings and an apparent reduction in cocaine use, based on regular urine tests.

Two studies reported nearly 80% of Freespira-treated patients were panic attack free at 12 months post-treatment. Two additional studies reported that patients with mixed anxiety disorders and low exhaled CO2 at baseline were less responsive and/or discontinued treatment with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or Acceptance Commitment Therapy.\n\nEarly data from a fifth study reported on Freespira treatment for patients with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Ninety percent of patients in this study experienced a significant improvement in PTSD symptoms at two months and six months post-treatment.\n\nSymposium Chair David Tolin, Ph.D., Director of Anxiety Disorders Center, The Institute of Living, and Adjunct Professor of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, commented, \"Studies of the Freespira treatment have shown that this innovative approach to treating patients suffering from panic symptoms and panic attacks not only significantly reduces or eliminates these symptoms in approximately 80% of patients, but also results in meaningful reduction in health costs.\"\n\nDebra Reisenthel, CEO of Palo Alto Health Sciences, added, \"Patients with panic symptoms and panic attacks have 3-5 times higher medical costs than patients without panic due to higher utilization of medical resources, including ED visits, physician visits and prescription drugs.\"\n\nFreespira is both easy to use and effective. Once a licensed healthcare provider authorizes the treatment and after a single training session, the patient uses Freespira at home, performing two 17-minute breathing sessions a day over a four-week period, after which the treatment is complete. The peer-reviewed published multi-center Freespira clinical trial, presented by Dr. Tolin, demonstrated that 71% of patients were panic attack free immediately after treatment and 79% of patients were panic attack free 12 months post-treatment.\n\nAbout Freespira\n\nFreespira is an FDA-cleared, drug-free, four-week at-home treatment for panic attacks and other panic symptoms. Treatment is authorized and completed under the supervision of a licensed healthcare provider. Freespira is clinically proven to reduce or eliminate panic attacks and other symptoms of panic disorder, a mental health condition in which debilitating anxiety leads to life-altering avoidance behaviors. Individuals with panic chronically hyperventilate, even when not experiencing a panic attack. This abnormal breathing pattern has been shown to exacerbate attacks. Freespira works by training the patient to stabilize respiration rate and exhaled carbon dioxide levels, which reduces or eliminates panic attacks.\n\nAbout Palo Alto Health Sciences, Inc.\n\nPalo Alto Health Sciences, Inc. is a privately held digital therapeutic company revolutionizing behavioral healthcare with evidence-based, non-invasive, drug-free solutions.

Diabetes patients' blood sugar levels become abnormally high, causing a host of serious complications including nerve damage, the need for amputations, blindness, and increased risk of heart attacks and strokes.\n\nMany earlier studies had shown that tightly controlling blood sugar significantly reduced the risk of many complications. The new study -- known as the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes, or Accord, trial -- was designed to convincingly test whether various aggressive treatment strategies reduced the risk of heart disease -- the main cause of death among diabetics.\n\nThe study involves 10,251 patients ages 40 to 82 at 77 sites in the United States and Canada at high risk for heart disease for any reason, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol or obesity. About half were placed on a regimen combining diet and exercise with commonly used drugs designed to lower their blood sugar levels to those of the average person with diabetes, while the other half were put on a more intensive regimen designed to drive levels closer to those of someone without diabetes. The patients were further divided into those who also received blood-pressure-lowering medication or drugs to improve their cholesterol levels.\n\nOver about four years, about half of the patients getting intensive treatment achieved blood sugar levels close to normal, and about half the patients in the standard treatment group achieved levels close to the average diabetic.\n\nBut a special 10 member panel that was monitoring the study alerted the organizers that 257 patients r eceiving intensive treatment had died, compared with 203 receiving standard treatment, a difference of 54 deaths -- or 3 per 1,000 participants per year, officials said. About half the excess deaths were from heart disease.\n\n\"We obviously were surprised,\" Nabel said. \"We were hoping for a positive outcome.\"\n\nLetters were mailed to all participants Monday notifying them of the results so they could consult with their doctors about switching to the less intensive therapy.\n\nNabel stressed that while the death rate was higher in the intensive group, the rate in both groups was still lower than would be expected in patients at high risk receiving standard treatment.\n\n\"Although there appear to be some benefit of an overall lower death rate in both groups, the [special panel] recommended stopping the trial,\" Nabel said. \"The harm of the very intensive treatment outweighed the potential benefit.\"\n\nThe researchers stressed that the findings would not alter current guidelines or treatment for most diabetics, many of whom can control their blood sugar without drugs.\n\n\"Few patients with high cardiovascular risk like those studied in Accord are treated to blood sugar levels as low as those tested in this study,\" said Judith Fradkin of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.\n\nDriving blood sugar levels very low might still prove beneficial for other patients, such as those who are younger, were diagnosed more recently or are not at high risk for heart disease.\n\n\"It is not yet known whether controlling glucose to near normal levels will prevent heart disease and extend life in other groups,\" Fradkin said.\n\nOfficials defended the study, saying previous research had suggested that intensive blood sugar lowering would be beneficial.\n\n\"Accord is an important study intended to find new answers to help people with Type 2 diabetes reduce their high risk of heart disease,\" said Denise G. Simons Morton, the project's director.\n\nDespite an intensive analysis, researchers were unable to determine the cause of the excess deaths.

When it comes to the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease, the oral drug levodopa has long been considered the gold standard, improving quality of life and longevity. But as the disease progresses, the effects of the medication can partially wear off more quickly after each dose, leaving people to experience \u201coff\u201d time, which are periods of immobility related to temporary unresponsiveness to medication. Parkinson\u2019s symptoms, such as slowness and muscle rigidity, often make movement difficult. \u201cIf a person with Parkinson\u2019s disease can reduce their \u2018off\u2019 times, that can have a great impact on their everyday life,\u201d said study author Regina Katzenschlager, MD, of Danube Hospital, affiliated with the Medical University of Vienna, Austria. \u201cIn some patients in the trial, the insecurity of unpredictable periods of incapacity was completely alleviated.\u201d The drug apomorphine, first produced in 1865, was first used to treat advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease in the United States in 1950. Its use grew in the 1990s when European doctors starting using subcutaneous infusions of the drug to treat fluctuations in mobility that could not be controlled by the pills. Despite its use in many countries of the world, high-level evidence from randomized, blinded studies of its effectiveness and safety has up until now been lacking. In this phase III study, researchers recruited 107 people with advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease from 23 centers in seven countries. Participants were randomly selected to receive either apomorphine subcutaneous infusion or a placebo saline infusion. The infusion was administered over a period of 14 to 18 hours each day via a small portable pump similar to the sort used in the treatment of type 1 diabetes. The study found that those who were given apomorphine had a significantly greater reduction of \u201coff\u201d time than those who were given the placebo infusion, with, on average, 2.5 hours less \u201coff\u201d time per day, while those who received the placebo infusion had an average 30 minutes per day reduction in \u201coff\u201d time. This improvement was apparent within the first week of treatment. At the same time, for those who received apomorphine, there was an increase of \u201con\u201d time without the abnormal involuntary movements known as dyskinesias that are often observed with levodopa. Participants were also asked to evaluate how well they thought the treatment worked. Those who received apomorphine gave their treatment higher scores at week 12 than those who received the placebo infusion. In the apomorphine group, 71 percent of patients felt improved, compared to 18 percent on placebo, whereas 19 percent worsened on apomorphine compared to 45 percent on placebo. Apomorphine was generally well tolerated and there were no serious side effects. \u201cIt is our hope that these findings confirming the efficacy of apomorphine infusion will encourage doctors in the United States to offer this treatment to their patients and assess its efficacy in their own clinical practice,\u201d said Katzenschlager.

It\u2019s the weekly rock climbers and double spin class-takers schvitzing their Sunday away.

In a study based on nearly 64,000 adults, researchers in the U.K. found that weekend exercise appears to be just as effective at preventing heart disease and cancer as exercise done more frequently. This is great news for anyone who feels too busy on weekdays to work out but enjoys outdoor activity on the weekend.\n\n\u201cI think that the weekend warrior physical activity pattern is beneficial because they are actually doing a large proportion of vigorous intensity activity. And vigorous activity makes you fit, and fitness reduces your risk of disease and death,\u201d says Gary O\u2019Donovan, a researcher in physical activity and sedentary behavior at England\u2019s Loughborough University and lead author of the paper.\n\nO\u2019Donovan and fellow researchers looked at data on middle-aged adults who responded to a government-sponsored household survey conducted from 1994 to 2012. The survey included questions about health history and fitness habits. The researchers then cross-referenced this information with health department death records.\n\nThey found the risk of death from all causes was about 30 percent lower for weekend warriors, compared with adults who maintained a sedentary lifestyle. And the warriors had a 40 percent lower risk of cardiovascular death and an 18 percent lower risk for cancer-related death. The mortality rates of weekend warriors were roughly the same as those who claimed to exercise more than two days a week but for shorter durations.\n\nHowever, there are also some limitations to this study, the researchers say. More than 90 percent of the subjects were white. The information about physical activity was reported by the participants, and it\u2019s likely that many were too generous in their estimates of how much time they spent at the gym. Unfortunately, taking 20 minutes in locker room to put on your sneakers doesn\u2019t count as a workout.\n\nRelated: Severe childhood obesity is on the rise in the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s recommended that people get 150 minutes (or two and half hours) of exercise each week, based on guidelines from the American Heart Association, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other medical authorities. This could be something as simple as a brisk walk or other low-impact options for vigorous exercise about 20 minutes a day. (Experts often encourage recreational athletes to not exercise more than an hour a day.) \u201cIn theory, someone who did one bout of 150 minutes of moderate exercise is a weekend warrior,\u201d says O\u2019Donovan.\n\nThis study shows that it doesn\u2019t matter how you decide to split up the recommended weekly amount of exercise. You just need to do it.\n\nHowever, experts caution that it is possible to overdo it, and more exercise than two and a half hours a week can actually be unhelpful and even harmful. One study, published in 2014 in the journal Heart, suggests that in people with existing heart disease, the risk for cardiac arrest and stroke was the same for people who exercised more than an hour a day compared with those who didn\u2019t exercise at all. The coronary heart disease patients who stuck with the recommended 150 minutes a week had the lowest risk for heart attack and stroke.\n\nRelated: Post-workout cold immersion likely won\u2019t help you heal\n\nThere are risks that come with a weekend warrior exercise schedule, especially for people who aren\u2019t used to being active. \u201cI would be more concerned about what\u2019s happening at the point of exercise\u2014not the long-term benefits,\u201d says Dr. Howard Andrew Selinger, chair of family medicine at Quinnipiac University.

It can provide moderate intensity aerobic physical activity, and its health benefits are greatest for players (and spectators) who walk round the course rather than opt for a golf cart.\n\nWhile around 60 million people play golf at least twice every year, the participant profile is quite narrow: players tend to be middle aged to older, male, of white European heritage, relatively well off, and living in North America, Europe, and Australasia.\n\nAnd the sport is often perceived as expensive, male dominated, difficult to learn, and not a game for the young or those on the lower rungs of the social ladder.\n\nThis can put people off, says the statement.

This might include reducing blood pressure and inflammation, he added.\n\nPrevious research linked dementia risk with the amount of omega-3 fatty acids in blood plasma, which reflects how much people had eaten in the past few days. But in the current work, researchers could estimate the amount of omega-3s that participants had consumed in the past several months by looking at how much had built up in their red blood cells.\n\n\"This represents their average intake of fatty acids, not just a snapshot,\" Tan said.\n\nThe study, published in the Feb. 28 issue of the journal Neurology, did not prove that omega-3 fatty acids prevent mental decline, merely that there may be an association between consumption of fatty acids and brain health.\n\nFor the study, researchers measured the red blood cell level of fatty acids in 1,575 dementia-free people whose average age was 67. About three months later, participants underwent mental-functioning tests and MRI scans that examined brain size and blood supply in the brain.\n\nThe participants were in the Framingham Offspring Study, which is predominately white. Whether the association would apply to other ethnic and racial groups needs to be explored, the authors said.\n\nThe researchers found that those with the lowest levels of omega-3s had worse scores on tests of visual memory, attention and abstract thinking than people who ranked in the top 75 percent for fatty-acid levels.\n\nAdults in the bottom 25 percent also tended to have smaller brain volume overall. The decrease in brain volume was enough to make their brains appear two years older than those of people in the top three-quarters for fatty-acid levels.\n\nBrain scans also showed signs of less blood supply in the brains of people with the lowest omega-3 levels. This suggests they may play a role in promoting general vascular, or blood vessel, health in the brain, similar to how they are thought to help heart health, rather than acting on just one brain area, Tan said.\n\nThe researchers took into account various health and lifestyle factors, including age, education and body mass index, to explore whether other differences among the people with low levels of omega-3s could help explain their more rapid brain aging.\n\nBut after controlling for those risk factors, \"the difference [in brain aging] is still there so we conclude that omega-3 fatty acids likely explain them,\" Tan said.\n\nTan added, however, that it remains possible that factors they did not control for, such as fruit and vegetable consumption, are really responsible for the brain benefits. Another possibility is that the slight mental decline that the people in the older brain group were experiencing caused them to eat less healthy omega-3-rich foods, instead of vice versa.\n\n\"This is a strengthening of the argument that people with less [omega-3 fatty acids] have higher risk of dementia,\" said Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, associate professor of clinical neurology at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City.\n\nBut questions remain over whether fatty-acid levels really influence changes in brain size, Scarmeas added. A clinical trial comparing high and low intake of omega-3s in relation to brain imaging would help answer those questions, he said.\n\nIn the meantime, fish is \"a good prescription for other things and we have a hint it might be helpful for the brain,\" Scarmeas said.\n\nThat the current study reported a difference in brain health between people with omega-3 fatty-acid levels in the bottom 25 percent and top 75 percent suggests that there is a threshold level of consumption to attain brain gains.\n\nA previous study in which participants filled out food surveys found decreased risk of vascular brain problems among those who ate at least three servings of fish a week.\n\nFind out more about brain health at the Alzheimer's Association.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Although we think readers will come away with the correct bottom line message on this study, we\u2019re going to rate this criterion unsatisfactory, for two reasons:", "answer": 0}, {"article": "\"Previous patients got sick, but it wasn't clear at the time whether it was due to the T cells or an infection,\" said pediatric oncologist Stephan Grupp, who oversaw Emily's care at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \"Now we know the main reason they were sick was the cells.

If it does, Orlistat (xenical) -- currently sold only by prescription -- could be available over-the-counter (OTC) later this year. But it's important to know that the weight loss that's typical for users of the drug -- 5 to 10 percent of total weight -- will be less than many dieters expect. And many consumers may be put off by the drug's significant gastrointestinal side effects, including flatulence, diarrhea and anal leakage.\n\nNor is Orlistat a quick fix for unwanted pounds. To achieve any weight loss, users must also eat fewer calories and exercise more.\n\n\"It's not a miracle drug,\" notes Lawrence Cheskin, director of the Weight Management Center at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in Baltimore, who conducted a study of Orlistat in adolescents. \"None of these [weight loss] medications are.\"\n\nOrlistat was approved as a weight loss and weight maintenance drug by the FDA in 1999 to treat obese and overweight people -- those with a body mass index of 30 or higher -- and overweight people (with BMI of 27 or higher) who already have weight-related health problems including diabetes, heart disease or high blood pressure.\n\nMore than 100 studies involving some 30,000 patients have been conducted with Orlistat, according to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Consumer Healthcare, the maker of Orlistat, which has petitioned the FDA to permit OTC sales of the drug. The company says that 22 million people in 145 countries have taken the drug. \"Orlistat is a very safe and effective drug with a long history of use around the world,\" says George Quesnelle, president of GSK Consumer Healthcare, North America.\n\nIn the longest study of Orlistat, participants who took the drug in addition to eating fewer calories and increasing exercise shed up to 12 percent of their body weight the first year. But by the fourth year of the study, they had regained some pounds. Overall, they lost about 7 percent of their body weight, compared to 4 percent for a control group that dieted and increased physical activity but didn't take the drug. The 7 percent figure works out to about 18 pounds for someone who weighs 250.\n\n\"That's little difference in weight, but significant in terms of medical benefits,\" notes Samuel Klein, director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine. Those lost pounds translate to lower blood pressure, improved blood cholesterol levels and reduced risk of diabetes.\n\nWhile Americans spend an estimated $1 billion on nonprescription weight loss products, few if any of those products have undergone the rigorous testing that is required by the FDA for prescription medications. Some weight loss experts say making Orlistat available directly to consumers broadens the proven options available to people trying to reach a healthier weight. \"It's very exciting,\" Klein says.\n\nBut \"the problem with Orlistat are the side effects,\" notes Johns Hopkins endocrinologist Aniket Sidhaye, co-author with Cheskin of a recent scientific review of Orlistat and other prescription weight loss drugs.\n\nAt the current recommended prescription dose -- 120 milligrams taken up to three times per day, for example up to 360 milligrams daily -- about 70 percent of users experience gastrointestinal complications, Klein says.

Statins include widely used medications such as Crestor, Lipitor and Zocor.\n\n\"For high-risk people, those with heart disease or [who] have had a stroke who are taking a standard dose of a statin, further reduction in LDL cholesterol will give them extra benefit,\" said Dr. Colin Baigent of the Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit at University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, who was involved in both studies. This applied even if the patients already had low levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or \"bad\") cholesterol, he noted.\n\nThe reports are published in the Nov. 9 online edition of The Lancet.\n\nIn the first study, researchers at Oxford and the University of Sydney in Australia collected data from studies on 170,000 patients who took part in 26 trials. This type of review, called a meta-analysis, gathers data from various studies to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nAmong these trials, five compared high doses of statins with regular doses and the other 21 studies compared people taking statins with people not taking the drugs.\n\nThe researchers found that in trials comparing statin doses, taking high-dose statins reduced the odds of having a stroke by an additional 15 percent, compared to the usual doses of statins.\n\nSpecifically, there was a 13 percent reduction in heart-related death or heart attack, a 19 percent reduction in the need for a new heart operation and a 16 percent reduction in stroke, the researchers found.\n\nWhen they did an updated analysis of the 21 trials, first major cardiovascular events (such as heart attack and stroke) were lowered by a \"highly significant\" 22 percent for a 1.07 millimole per liter (mmol/L) reduction of LDL cholesterol.\n\nTaking all 26 trials together, deaths were reduced by 10 percent for 1 mmol/L in reduction of LDL cholesterol, with no significant effect on deaths from stroke or other vascular causes.\n\nIn addition, there were no significant effects of statins on deaths due to cancer or other non-vascular causes, and no excess risk of cancer, even at low LDL cholesterol concentrations.\n\nThe second study is a randomized trial called the Study of the Effectiveness of Additional Reductions in Cholesterol and Homocysteine (SEARCH), led by professor Jane Armitage, also a scientist at the CTSU in Oxford.\n\nThis trial looked at the benefits of statin therapy with 80 milligrams (mg) versus 20 mg simvastatin (Zocor) among 12,000 heart attack survivors.\n\nThe study was supported by a grant from Merck (manufacturer of the simvastatin).\n\nOver almost seven years of follow-up, those taking the higher dose statin had greater reductions in LDL cholesterol compared with those taking the lower dose.\n\nThe reduction in LDL cholesterol from the higher dose ended up decreasing the risk of a major cardiac event by 6 percent, the researchers found, although the statistic in itself was not clinically significant.\n\nThe researchers noted that the higher dose of Zocor (simvastatin) did result in a risk of a muscle disease 10 times higher than that associated with the lower dose. The muscle disease, known as myopathy, can cause pain, weakness, and in its rare but most severe form, destruction of the muscle tissue leading to kidney failure. Researchers found that two cases of myopathy occurred with the low dose and 53 cases with the higher dose.\n\nResearchers also found that rhabdomyolysis -- the most severe form of the muscle disease associated with statins -- was diagnosed in seven participants given 80 mg of Zocor (simvastatin), compared to none who were given 20 mg of simvastatin. Two died within a few weeks of developing the disorder, with one cause of death mentioning the muscle disorder as a contributing factor.\n\nResearchers also found that seven participants had creatine kinase levels higher than 40 times the upper limit of normal -- a possible indicator of kidney damage. For this reason, they noted that the incidence of severe muscle disease on 80 mg of Zocor might be an \"underestimate.\"\n\nBaigent noted this side effect is one associated with Zocor, but taking lower doses of other, more powerful statins may alleviate the problem. \"There are newer ways of increasing LDL cholesterol reduction by using the newer, more potent statins such a Lipitor or Crestor,\" he said. (All statins carry the risk of myopathy, but lower dosages are associated with a reduced risk.)\n\nBernard M.Y. Cheung, from the University of Hong Kong and coauthor of an accompanying journal editorial, said that \"people who are at risk from heart attacks and strokes should have their LDL-cholesterol lowered intensively.\"\n\nTheir doctors should consider prescribing a statin, either at a high dose or using a more powerful statin, he said.\n\n\"If you are at risk from a heart attack or stroke, either because you have had these conditions before or because you have the risk factors for them, you should be considered for intensive treatment to lower the LDL cholesterol,\" Cheung said.\n\n\"If your blood cholesterol is raised but you do not have other risk factors for heart disease and stroke, then your doctor may well decide that you do not need to take any drugs to lower cholesterol,\" he said. \"But if you are at risk from those diseases, you would need intensive treatment to lower LDL cholesterol, even if your LDL cholesterol level is not very high,\" he added.\n\nCommenting on the studies, Dr. Gregg Fonarow, American Heart Association spokesman and professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that \"despite the proven benefits of LDL cholesterol-lowering with statin therapy, many physicians have been reluctant to prescribe and patients reluctant to take higher doses of more potent statin medications due to concerns about side effects or safety.\"\n\nLowering LDL cholesterol by 50 to 60 percent with potent statins such as atorvastatin at 80 mg or rosuvastatin at 20 to 40 mg lowers the risk of major cardiovascular events by 50 to 60 percent, he said.\n\n\"Most patients tolerate higher doses of more potent statins equally well as lower doses of less potent statins,\" Fonarow said. \"Millions of patients with or at high risk of cardiovascular disease, who would derive additional cardiovascular protection from higher doses of more potent statins, are not currently treated with these agents.

One group was fed the equivalent of two servings (2 ounces) per day of walnuts for humans, while the second group received a similar control diet with no walnuts. After 25 days, researchers found that in walnut-fed mice, key miRNA that may affect cancer cell inflammation, vascularization (blood supply) and proliferation were positively engaged.\n\nThe tumors of mice fed the walnut-containing diet were found to have 10 times the amount of total omega-3 fatty acids, including plant-based alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), in the tissue compared to the mice fed the control diet. The study results found that a smaller tumor size was associated with greater percentage of omega-3s in tumor tissues, suggesting that ALA may provide a protective benefit. Tumor growth rate was also significantly slower in the walnut group compared to the control group. As this study was conducted on animals, results cannot yet be implied for humans.\n\nALA is an essential fatty acid critical to various body processes and is known to reduce inflammation. Walnuts are the only nut that contain a significant source of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) (2.5 grams per ounce). Walnuts also contain a variety of antioxidants, (3.7 mmol/ounce), and numerous vitamins and minerals.\n\nColorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer worldwide and is second to only lung cancer as the leading cause of death in Western Countries.1 Diet has been shown to be a modifiable risk factor in preventing many types of cancer, including colorectal cancer.

The National Institutes of Health is financing more than 50 studies testing mindfulness techniques, up from 3 in 2000, to help relieve stress, soothe addictive cravings, improve attention, lift despair and reduce hot flashes.\n\nSome proponents say Buddha\u2019s arrival in psychotherapy signals a broader opening in the culture at large \u2014 a way to access deeper healing, a hidden path revealed.\n\nYet so far, the evidence that mindfulness meditation helps relieve psychiatric symptoms is thin, and in some cases, it may make people worse, some studies suggest. Many researchers now worry that the enthusiasm for Buddhist practice will run so far ahead of the science that this promising psychological tool could turn into another fad.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very open to the possibility that this approach could be effective, and it certainly should be studied,\u201d said Scott Lilienfeld, a psychology professor at Emory. \u201cWhat concerns me is the hype, the talk about changing the world, this allure of the guru that the field of psychotherapy has a tendency to cultivate.\u201d\n\nBuddhist meditation came to psychotherapy from mainstream academic medicine. In the 1970s, a graduate student in molecular biology, Jon Kabat-Zinn, intrigued by Buddhist ideas, adapted a version of its meditative practice that could be easily learned and studied. It was by design a secular version, extracted like a gemstone from the many-layered foundation of Buddhist teaching, which has sprouted a wide variety of sects and spiritual practices and attracted 350 million adherents worldwide.\n\nIn transcendental meditation and other types of meditation, practitioners seek to transcend or \u201close\u201d themselves. The goal of mindfulness meditation was different, to foster an awareness of every sensation as it unfolds in the moment.\n\nDr. Kabat-Zinn taught the practice to people suffering from chronic pain at the University of Massachusetts medical school. In the 1980s he published a series of studies demonstrating that two-hour courses, given once a week for eight weeks, reduced chronic pain more effectively than treatment as usual.\n\nWord spread, discreetly at first. \u201cI think that back then, other researchers had to be very careful when they talked about this, because they didn\u2019t want to be seen as New Age weirdos,\u201d Dr. Kabat-Zinn, now a professor emeritus of medicine at the University of Massachusetts, said in an interview. \u201cSo they didn\u2019t call it mindfulness or meditation. \u201cAfter a while, we put enough studies out there that people became more comfortable with it.\u201d\n\nOne person who noticed early on was Marsha Linehan, a psychologist at the University of Washington who was trying to treat deeply troubled patients with histories of suicidal behavior. \u201cTrying to treat these patients with some change-based behavior therapy just made them worse, not better,\u201d Dr. Linehan said in an interview. \u201cWith the really hard stuff, you need something else, something that allows people to tolerate these very strong emotions.\u201d\n\nIn the 1990s, Dr. Linehan published a series of studies finding that a therapy that incorporated Zen Buddhist mindfulness, \u201cradical acceptance,\u201d practiced by therapist and patient significantly cut the risk of hospitalization and suicide attempts in the high-risk patients.\n\nFinally, in 2000, a group of researchers including Dr. Segal in Toronto, J. Mark G. Williams at the University of Wales and John D. Teasdale at the Medical Research Council in England published a study that found that eight weekly sessions of mindfulness halved the rate of relapse in people with three or more episodes of depression.\n\nWith Dr. Kabat-Zinn, they wrote a popular book, \u201cThe Mindful Way Through Depression.\u201d Psychotherapists\u2019 curiosity about mindfulness, once tentative, turned into \u201cthis feeding frenzy, of sorts, that we have going on now,\u201d Dr. Kabat-Zinn said.\n\nMindfulness meditation is easy to describe. Sit in a comfortable position, eyes closed, preferably with the back upright and unsupported. Relax and take note of body sensations, sounds and moods. Notice them without judgment. Let the mind settle into the rhythm of breathing. If it wanders (and it will), gently redirect attention to the breath. Stay with it for at least 10 minutes.\n\nAfter mastering control of attention, some therapists say, a person can turn, mentally, to face a threatening or troubling thought \u2014 about, say, a strained relationship with a parent \u2014 and learn simply to endure the anger or sadness and let it pass, without lapsing into rumination or trying to change the feeling, a move that often backfires.\n\nOne woman, a doctor who had been in therapy for years to manage bouts of disabling anxiety, recently began seeing Gaea Logan, a therapist in Austin, Tex., who incorporates mindfulness meditation into her practice. This patient had plenty to worry about, including a mentally ill child, a divorce and what she described as a \u201charsh internal voice,\u201d Ms. Logan said.\n\nAfter practicing mindfulness meditation, she continued to feel anxious at times but told Ms. Logan, \u201cI can stop and observe my feelings and thoughts and have compassion for myself.\u201d\n\nSteven Hayes, a psychologist at the University of Nevada at Reno, has developed a talk therapy called Acceptance Commitment Therapy, or ACT, based on a similar, Buddha-like effort to move beyond language to change fundamental psychological processes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shift from having our mental health defined by the content of our thoughts,\u201d Dr. Hayes said, \u201cto having it defined by our relationship to that content \u2014 and changing that relationship by sitting with, noticing and becoming disentangled from our definition of ourselves.\u201d\n\nFor all these hopeful signs, the science behind mindfulness is in its infancy. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which researches health practices, last year published a comprehensive review of meditation studies, including T.M., Zen and mindfulness practice, for a wide variety of physical and mental problems. The study found that over all, the research was too sketchy to draw conclusions.\n\nA recent review by Canadian researchers, focusing specifically on mindfulness meditation, concluded that it did \u201cnot have a reliable effect on depression and anxiety.\u201d\n\nTherapists who incorporate mindfulness practices do not agree when the meditation is most useful, either. Some say Buddhist meditation is most useful for patients with moderate emotional problems. Others, like Dr. Linehan, insist that patients in severe mental distress are the best candidates for mindfulness.\n\nA case in point is mindfulness-based therapy to prevent a relapse into depression. The treatment significantly reduced the risk of relapse in people who have had three or more episodes of depression. But it may have had the opposite effect on people who had one or two previous episodes, two studies suggest.\n\nThe mindfulness treatment \u201cmay be contraindicated for this group of patients,\u201d S. Helen Ma and Dr. Teasdale of the Medical Research Council concluded in a 2004 study of the therapy.\n\nSince mindfulness meditation may have different effects on different mental struggles, the challenge for its proponents will be to specify where it is most effective \u2014 and soon, given how popular the practice is becoming.\n\nThe question, said Linda Barnes, an associate professor of family medicine and pediatrics at the Boston University School of Medicine, is not whether mindfulness meditation will become a sophisticated therapeutic technique or lapse into self-help clich\u00e9.\n\n\u201cThe answer to that question is yes to both,\u201d Dr. Barnes said.\n\nThe real issue, most researchers agree, is whether the science will keep pace and help people distinguish the mindful variety from the mindless.\n\nA variety of meditative practices have been studied by Western researchers for their effects on mental and physical health.\n\nAn active exercise, sometimes called moving meditation, involving extremely slow, continuous movement and extreme concentration. The movements are to balance the vital energy of the body but have no religious significance.\n\nStudies are mixed, some finding it can reduce blood pressure in patients, and others finding no effect.

Founded in 1957, it struggled for decades to find uses for the product, almost going out of business before licensing the drug to Auxilium in 2004.\n\n\u201cIt sort of proves to people that if you really believe in a drug you should never give up,\u201d said Matthew Geller, a biotechnology investment banker who is a member of the BioSpecifics board.\n\nShares of BioSpecifics closed Monday at $27.61, up from $1 as recently as late 2006.\n\nSome people treated with Xiaflex in clinical trials for the Dupuytren\u2019s hand condition said it had made a big difference in their lives, and had allowed them to avoid painful surgery.\n\n\u201cWhen I looked down and saw my finger straightened out, I cried,\u201d said Kenneth Nelson, 65, of Indianapolis. \u201cIt was to me just like a miracle.\u201d\n\nXiaflex is an enzyme produced by a gangrene-causing bacterium, Clostridium histolyticum, which uses it to eat away the tissues of its victims. The enzyme, called collagenase, breaks down collagen, a major component of the body\u2019s connective tissue that is found in skin, tendons, cartilage and other organs.\n\nBut collagenase by itself does not cause gangrene. And there are times doctors need to break down collagen, such as when an excess builds up in the hand or penis, causing Dupuytren\u2019s and Peyronie\u2019s. The ailments are named for French surgeons who described the conditions in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nThe enzyme was first extracted from the bacteria around 1950 by Ines Mandl, a young biochemist at Columbia University. Edwin H. Wegman, a Long Island entrepreneur, learned about Dr. Mandl\u2019s work and set up a company called Advance Biofactures, which later became BioSpecifics, to turn collagenase into a drug.\n\nIn 1965, the company won approval of an ointment containing collagenase for use in removing dead tissue from skin ulcers and burns. The ointment, sold by licensees under the name Santyl, was a modest success, but the company never truly prospered.\n\nSo in the 1970s the company began developing what it thought would be a bigger money-maker, an injectable collagenase. It tested that drug for numerous uses, including herniated disks. Finally, in the early 1990s, two professors of orthopedics at the nearby State University of New York at Stony Brook suggested using the drug for Dupuytren\u2019s.\n\nThe professors, Dr. Lawrence C. Hurst and Marie A. Badalamente, injected the drug into the tails of rats, as a stand-in for human fingers. They found they could dissolve the collagen in tendons, making the tails floppy, without harming nearby nerves and arteries. Then they organized clinical trials in patients and got federal grants to help pay for the work. The professors and Stony Brook will share a royalty of one half of 1 percent of sales of Xiaflex for use in treating Dupuytren\u2019s.\n\nBut work was slowed by lack of money, and by 2004, BioSpecifics was about out of cash. In desperation, Ed Wegman\u2019s son Mark, a top computer scientist at I.B.M., called a childhood friend, Laurence Korn, who had been the chief executive of a successful biotechnology company now known as PDL BioPharma.\n\nWith Dr. Korn\u2019s help, BioSpecifics licensed the drug to Auxilium in a matter of weeks, receiving $5 million initially.\n\nAuxilium was interested because of Peyronie\u2019s disease. It already was selling a gel for men with low testosterone and had learned from urologists about the need for better treatments for bent penises.\n\n\u201cFrom talking with surgeons and patients who have Peyronie\u2019s, neither of them wants to do the surgery,\u201d said Will Sargent, a spokesman for Auxilium.\n\nTwo years ago, the drug giant Pfizer, which sells the erectile dysfunction drug Viagra, licensed the European rights to Xiaflex from Auxilium for an initial payment of $75 million. BioSpecifics got $6.4 million of that amount and will receive 8.5 percent of additional payments of up to $410 million that Pfizer might make.\n\nAuxilium sought approval for treating Dupuytren\u2019s first because it was easier to measure success in straightening fingers. But the company hopes to begin late-stage trials of Xiaflex for Peyronie\u2019s disease later this year. In a midstage trial, injections of Xiaflex into the collagen plaque in the penis reduced the curvature. But the drug did not reduce pain or discomfort during intercourse by a statistically significant amount.\n\nWhile collagenase itself is not patented, the companies do have patents on the use of the enzyme to treat Dupuytren\u2019s and Peyronie\u2019s. They are also shielded from competition for seven years under a federal law aimed at spurring development of drugs for rare, or \u201corphan,\u201d diseases \u2014 even though newer estimates suggest these two diseases are not as rare as thought when the drugs were given orphan status.\n\nAuxilium and BioSpecifics hope that the half-century-old collagenase might eventually become as versatile as Botox, another bacterial product. They are looking at uses that range from loosening up immobile \u201cfrozen shoulders\u201d to eliminating fat bulges and cellulite.\n\nWith its belated success, BioSpecifics has sold off its ointment business. It now has only five employees and a business of collecting a roughly 11 to 12 percent royalty on sales of Xiaflex.\n\n\u201cWe will be a cash machine going forward,\u201d said Thomas L. Wegman, the president and the other son of the company founder. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to pay for marketing.

But MetroHealth and Cleveland EMS officials say they aren't convinced the therapy is proven enough to rewrite the book on cardiac arrest treatment.\n\n\n\nThe American Heart Association recommended cooling for most cardiac arrest survivors after two small studies in Australia and Europe, published in 2002, showed a clear benefit. The therapy is targeted to patients stricken by ventricular fibrillation, an electrical disturbance that causes the heart's pumping chambers to quiver instead of pump. It's the most common cause of sudden cardiac arrest.\n\nMany hospitals and cities have been slow to adopt the heart association recommendations.\n\nDr. Arie Blitz, a UH heart surgeon and president of the heart association's Cleveland chapter, is calling for a Columbus-like system here.\n\nColumbus rescue workers start the cooling process with cold saline IV's and ice packs placed in the armpits and groin. Hospitals take over with more sophisticated cooling equipment. Some Cleveland-area hospitals have looked at inflatable suits that circulate cold water.\n\n\"I am still amazed that lots of physicians are not aware of the technology,\" Blitz said in an e-mail. \"And if they are aware, they are not using it.\"\n\nDespite often heroic efforts to save cardiac arrest victims with CPR and defibrillation, two out of three who regain a pulse but don't wake up don't survive to hospital discharge. Even those who do are often neurologically impaired.\n\n\"In the past, we thought this was a hopeless cause,\" said Dr. Michael DeGeorgia, UH's director of neuro-intensive care and a proponent of cooling therapy. \"We know now there's a lot we can do about it. Now we cool patients and they walk and talk and go home.\"\n\nDoctors say they don't fully understand why cooling works. But the process protects the brain from damage caused by a cascade of biochemical reactions that occur when circulation is restored.\n\nUH is working out procedures for its emergency department and Cleveland Heights EMS crews. The Cleveland Clinic is also looking at cooling equipment for all its system hospitals, said Dr. Thomas Tallman, an emergency doctor and Clinic EMS director.\n\nBut Dr. David Rosenbaum, director of MetroHealth's heart and vascular center, said there is not enough research data to justify a regional system. Rosenbaum, a heart rhythm specialist, also challenged whether cooling is a priority, considering that heartbeat is restored in only a small number of people who suffer cardiac arrest outside hospitals.\n\nWith more than 300,000 deaths a year in the United States from cardiac arrest, Rosenbaum said the focus should be on preventing deadly rhythm disturbances and improving access to defibrillation.\n\n\"The more upstream the interventions are, the greater impact they will have on sudden death,\" Rosenbaum said. Cooling \"at best can have really a small impact on the bigger problem.\"\n\nMetroHealth would play an important role in a coordinated system because of its high patient volume and its medical oversight of Cleveland EMS.\n\nCleveland EMS Commissioner Edward Eckart said based on advice from Dr. Thomas Collins, city EMS medical director and a MetroHealth emergency doctor, the city has no plans to carry cooling equipment or transport patients only to hospitals that provide the therapy.\n\nEckart said the city has not been approached about starting a program, but he agrees the medical research on lives saved is not strong enough to shift gears. The city now takes cardiac arrest survivors to the closest hospital capable of emergency angioplasty (a treatment for heart attacks, which often happen in tandem with cardiac arrest).\n\nA regional approach to cooling \"is not something we believe right now is worth taking on,\" Eckart said.\n\nCooling therapy is part of a larger push to improve dismal survival rates from cardiac arrest.\n\nChances of surviving depends largely on where you live. For example, patients treated in large, urban teaching hospitals have better odds than those treated elsewhere, according to research from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine published last month.\n\nAnd people in cities that have pushed cardiac arrest as a public health imperative - focusing on bystander CPR training, defibrillation programs and EMS response - also fare better.\n\nCities such as Seattle report survival rates above 35 percent for ventricular fibrillation arrests - the type that can be corrected with defibrillation. But the national average is about 4 percent.\n\nIn 2007, UH's Blitz, calling the gap in survival rates an embarrassment, pressed Cleveland hospitals and EMS officials to join a national program to track outcomes and improve survival. City officials do not know the survival rate here, according to a spokeswoman. But she said Cleveland plans to join the national program, which is supported by the heart association and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nColumbus is already part of the program, called Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival. The city's survival rate is 12 percent, and it is expected to improve with a citywide cooling program adopted last July, said Dr. David Keseg, the Columbus EMS medical director.\n\nColumbus handles about 500 cardiac arrests a year. \"All our hospitals have signed on to cooling, so we haven't had to establish resuscitation centers,\" Keseg said. Asked about outcomes, he said results won't be available until the program reaches one year.\n\nThough it's not unusual to have debate over new therapies, the benefits of induced hypothermia is not a new discovery. Napoleon's medics were said to ice soldiers to preserve injured limbs 200 years ago. Cooling was tested as far back as the 1950's for cardiac arrest survivors. Today it's used routinely to reduce complications of heart surgeries, and it has shown promise for stroke and spinal injuries.\n\nBlitz uses a cooling device during some surgeries, and he has received research money from the device-maker, Alsius Corp. of Irvine, Calif.\n\nBlitz said debate should be aired publicly, and he is not rattled by opposition to plans for a regional approach.\n\n\"I think the data shows that for patients who have cardiac arrest and are not waking up, there's very little downside,\" he added. \"Why not offer them something?\"", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Although the experts quoted in the story indicated that survival would be improved with the use of this treatment, there was no indication of how many more individuals might survive or might have less brain damage as a result of cooling.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "In a landmark medical clash pitting the diagnostic merits of fancy tech versus vintage exercise machines, the new toys and old ways finished in a dead heat, cardiologists reported Saturday.\n\nThe first showdown pitting 3-D, heart-imaging exams against older stress tests atop treadmills or stationary bikes found that among 10,003 heart patients, their rates of eventually having serious heart events were the same \u2014 no matter which method doctors used to check their tickers, researchers said.\n\nEven more surprising, the rate of bad outcomes among the heart patients studied were extremely low. In both test groups, only about 3 percent of the people had heart attacks, suffered \"major\" complications, needed hospitalization for chest pain or died during two years of tracking, researchers found.\n\nWhich prompts a big question: Could the use of stress tests or expensive scans become less frequent for heart patients, replaced by more watchful waiting?\n\n\"We were very pleasantly surprised,\" said Dr. Pamela Douglas, Ursula Geller professor of research in cardiovascular diseases at Duke University, and the study\u2019s lead author.\n\nResults of the federally funded trial \u2014 Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain (PROMISE) \u2014 were presented at the American College of Cardiology\u2019s 64th Annual Scientific Session in San Diego.

We didn\u2019t before.\"\n\nThe 10,000-plus patients, who visited 193 health centers in the U.S. and Canada, had no prior diagnosis of coronary artery disease. But they had new symptoms that caused physicians to suspect heart disease \u2014 and nearly all had at least one risk factor like high blood pressure, diabetes or a history of smoking.\n\nHalf were randomly selected to get a computed tomographic angiography (CTA), which creates a 3-D image of the heart's arteries, allowing physicians to spot narrowing. The rest took stress tests \u2014 either an exercise electrocardiogram, a stress echocardiography or a nuclear stress test, which uses radioactive dye. Stress tests measure the heart's response to exertion, letting doctors see or hear any disease.\n\n\"The remarkable thing about the study is ... these were quite high-risk patients, but the actual [bad] event rate was very low ... It is a real testament to how far we\u2019ve come in the treatment of patients with suspected coronary disease,\" said Dr. Steven Nissen, department chair of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. He was not part of the study.\n\nPrevention tactics do seem to be working: Lowering cholesterol through diet and medicine, keeping blood pressure in check, and helping people to stop smoking.\n\n\"Traditionally, when you come in with chest pain, some sort of stress test or CT angiogram will be performed,\" Nissen said. \"And I wonder if it's worth doing those tests when rates of cardiac events are so low.\"\n\nUntil this study, doctors have been \"guessing\" which form of those two diagnostic tests is best, Douglas said.\n\nAnd while there's often no wrong choice between CTAs and stress tests, the new findings underscore a vital nuance, she added.\n\nCTAs, the study found, result in fewer instances of patients with suspected heart issues undergoing unneeded catheterization procedures \u2014 only to later learn they had no artery problems.\n\n\"If you have chest pains and you needed a test,\" Douglas said, \"and if I said to you: 'Either one of these two tests will be equally effective in preventing heart attack or death, but this one will have less chance of going to the cath lab if you don\u2019t have blockages,' which one would you pick?\"\n\nEach year, about 4 million Americans report heart symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath.\n\nBut one Cleveland Clinic patient epitomizes a difference between CTAs and stress tests \u2014 and he does so just by being alive.\n\nAt age 48, David, an electrical engineer, was in great condition, biking 50 miles on a weekend.

He easily passed several stress tests on treadmills.\n\nBut \u2014 partly because his mother had died of coronary artery disease at age 49 \u2014 David remained unconvinced by those results. He underwent a CTA at Cleveland Clinic, and it showed severely blocked arteries. He soon underwent a bypass surgery. He is healthy today, now 50.\n\nAs a result, however, David's two brothers, both close to his age, were convinced to undergo CTAs. Both were found to have blocked arteries, also requiring immediate surgeries.\n\n\"None of us had any indications,\" David said. \"Just because I had a CTA, that had a domino effect to my brothers getting it, and it very well saved all three of our lives.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "This is an example of a story thrown off course by a single misleading anecdote.\nDiscussion of benefits is quite reasonable for 90% of the story, and we noted that the report offers specific information on the incidence of heart attacks or complications\u20143%\u2014in the course of making the point that the incidence does not differ between patients undergoing stress tests versus CTA.

In fact, a major concern with CTA is that it may reveal blockages that would never cause a serious problem, leading to unnecessary procedures. The point of the study is that there was no difference at all in the incidence of serious cardiac complications between those who undergo stress tests and those who get CTA.\nUnfortunately, that careful science-based message is badly undercut by the story\u2019s failure to push back against this anecdotal crystal ball-gazing.

So it\u2019s difficult to think about how a single shot might work against all the different HIV subtypes circulating around the world.\n\nBut scientists may be inching toward a vaccine that could tackle HIV\u2019s genetic diversity and prevent the virus from taking hold in people.\n\nResearchers from the National Institutes of Health and Johnson & Johnson at the International AIDS Society conference in Paris Monday morning presented data on a clinical trial of what\u2019s called the \u201cAd26-env mosaic vaccine.\u201d\n\nThe mosaic vaccine was developed using a computer algorithm to analyze HIV data from around the world and select a range of HIV sequences to include in a shot. It\u2019s called a \u201cmosaic\u201d because it involves taking pieces of different viruses and sticking them together to generate immune responses that can cover a broad range of HIV subtypes.\n\n\u201cOne of the great challenges for development of HIV vaccine is viral diversity,\u201d said Dan Barouch, a lead researcher on the vaccine and director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. \u201cThe mosaic strategy is one way to attempt to deal with the global virus diversity.\u201d\n\nA word of caution, though: We\u2019re only in the early phase of human testing, and the vaccine could ultimately fail to prevent the virus from spreading among people. But so far, the HIV community is carefully watching the Ad26 vaccine research because the approach seems quite promising.\n\nThe mosaic approach seems promising in very early clinical research\n\nIn the 35 years of the HIV epidemic, only four HIV vaccine concepts have been tested in humans. The mosaic strategy is the fifth concept, and one of only two HIV vaccines that\u2019s currently part of clinical trials of efficacy in humans. (The other is the HVTN 702 HIV vaccine candidate, now underway in Thailand.)\n\nIn the study of the Ad26 mosaic vaccine, called the APPROACH trial, 393 volunteers in the United States, Rwanda, Uganda, South Africa, and Thailand were randomly assigned to receive one of seven experimental vaccines or a placebo. The mosaic vaccine was the best tolerated and also capable of generating anti-HIV immune responses in all the people who received the shots.\n\nBefore this, studies of the mosaic vaccine in rhesus monkeys showed a 66 percent efficacy rate, meaning 66 percent of monkeys that got the shot were protected from the virus. (With HIV, 50 to 60 percent is about the efficacy range researchers hope for.) Interestingly, in the early human study, the immune response was comparable to the rhesus monkey one, which gave the researchers hope that the vaccine might be similarly effective in people.\n\nWe need more human studies of this HIV vaccine\n\nBut we still don\u2019t know if the vaccine will protect humans from the virus, since the studies so far have only looked at safety and immune responses, not efficacy. And many medicines that look promising in animals, and safe in humans, don\u2019t pan out in clinical trials focused on efficacy.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t use the word excited too much,\u201d said Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH\u2019s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \u201cIt\u2019s a step forward toward getting another candidate into trial that could have some promise.\u201d It\u2019s too soon to say if and when the mosaic vaccine might work to prevent the virus from spreading in humans, he added.\n\nAs for next steps, if the researchers continue to see promising data on the mosaic vaccine from another ongoing study, a larger human efficacy trial will move forward toward the end of the year in southern Africa, involving some 2,600 healthy, HIV-negative women.\n\nDeaths from AIDS have halved since 2005 \u2014 but there\u2019s still a ton of work to be done\n\nWe\u2019ve made remarkable progress against HIV around the world. In 1996, as HIV prevalence was peaking around the world, the United Nations established UNAIDS, the first global health body focused on a single disease. In 2000, the UN Security Council convened an unprecedented meeting to address the out-of-control AIDS crisis. This led to a massive concentration of resources into HIV/AIDS research, and triggered global and coordinated efforts to stem the disease.\n\nResearchers and doctors figured out how to get people tested and diagnosed quickly, and uncovered effective treatments that allowed those with HIV to live long, relatively healthy lives. Public health officials also waged awareness campaigns about prevention, reminding people to practice safe sex with condoms and get tested, and that early HIV treatment can save lives. Recently, researchers even discovered a pill to prevent HIV.\n\nDeaths from AIDS have halved to 1 million since 2005, and UNAIDS estimates almost 20 million people now have access to treatment. (Some of that access is now in jeopardy, however, given that President Donald Trump has proposed cutting $800 million from a key US government AIDS program called PEPFAR in the 2018 budget.)\n\nAn HIV vaccine has long been elusive. The other HIV vaccine in human testing, the HVTN 702 candidate, is a newer version of the only other HIV vaccine to show any efficacy in humans, called RV144. In a trial on the RV144, 31 percent of people who got the vaccine did not develop HIV \u2014 too small a number to be useful. But with the new HVTN trial, researchers hope some tweaks to the vaccine might boost the efficacy rate.\n\n\u201cA safe and effective HIV vaccine would be a powerful tool to reduce new HIV infections worldwide and help bring about a durable end to the HIV/AIDS pandemic,\u201d Fauci said in a statement. \u201cBy exploring multiple promising avenues of vaccine development research, we expand our opportunities to achieve these goals.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The APPROACH trial randomly assigned 393 volunteers from five countries to receive one of seven experimental vaccines or a placebo. \u00a0While the report notes that \u201cthe mosaic vaccine was the best tolerated and also capable of generating anti-HIV immune responses in all the people who received the shots,\u201d one is tempted to ask: Compared to what?

You'd take a nice big sniff to breathe in the sweet but subtle floral scent. Upon walking into a public restroom, you'd likely do just the opposite--abruptly limiting the flow of air through your nose. Now, researchers reporting in the Cell Press journal Current Biology on July 2 have found that people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) don't make this natural adjustment like other people do. Autistic children go right on sniffing in the same way, no matter how pleasant or awful the scent.\n\nThe findings suggest that non-verbal tests related to smell might serve as useful early indicators of ASD, the researchers say.\n\n\"The difference in sniffing pattern between the typically developing children and children with autism was simply overwhelming,\" says Noam Sobel of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.\n\nEarlier evidence had indicated that people with autism have impairments in \"internal action models,\" the brain templates we rely on to seamlessly coordinate our senses and actions. It wasn't clear if this impairment would show up in a test of the sniff response, however.\n\nTo find out, Sobel, along with Liron Rozenkrantz and their colleagues, presented 18 children with ASD and 18 normally developing children (17 boys and 1 girl in each group) with pleasant and unpleasant odors and measured their sniff responses. The average age of children in the study was 7. While typical children adjusted their sniffing within 305 milliseconds of smelling an odor, the researchers report, children on the autism spectrum showed no such response.\n\nThat difference in sniff response between the two groups of kids was enough to correctly classify them as children with or without a diagnosis of ASD 81% of the time. Moreover, the researchers report that increasingly aberrant sniffing was associated with increasingly severe autism symptoms, based on social but not motor impairments.\n\nThe findings suggest that a sniff test could be quite useful in the clinic, although the researchers emphasize that their test is in no way ready for that yet.\n\n\"We can identify autism and its severity with meaningful accuracy within less than 10 minutes using a test that is completely non-verbal and entails no task to follow,\" Sobel says. \"This raises the hope that these findings could form the base for development of a diagnostic tool that can be applied very early on, such as in toddlers only a few months old. Such early diagnosis would allow for more effective intervention.\"\n\nThe researchers now plan to test whether the sniff-response pattern they've observed is specific to autism or whether it might show up also in people with other neurodevelopmental conditions. They also want to find out how early in life such a test might be used.

It is a current device which is very similar to the ones that people use for pain relief with electrical stimulation of muscles and nerves, what\u2019s called TENS. The difference is that we use a particular current profile which you can stimulate the balance organs with without creating a balance disturbance. So you do not get the impression that the world is moving or that you are moving, you actually do not feel anything,\u201d Bergquist explained.\n\nThe device operates by providing stimulation via patches attached to the patient\u2019s head behind the ears, where the vestibular system is located.\n\nParkinson\u2019s disease is characterized by reduced levels in the brain of the hormone dopamine, a neurotransmitter that allows different regions of the brain to communicate with one another. Symptoms of advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease include an impaired sense of balance, as well as tremors, poor mobility, slowness and stiffness.\n\nNearly all patients diagnosed with the disease are treated with levodopa, a drug that stimulates the production of dopamine in the brain. The effectiveness of oral levodopa reduces as Parkinson\u2019s disease progresses in the patient and can lead to involuntary movements, or dyskinesia.\n\nIn earlier experiments on rats, researchers at Sahlgrenska showed that noisy electric stimulation of the balance organs could be used to change the activity of the brain, thereby balancing the effects of dopamine shortage and improving the animals\u2019 motor skills and balance.\n\nThe researchers have also tested the method on ten Swedish Parkinson\u2019s patients, in both medicated and unmedicated states. According to Sahlgrenska, on one day the patients received an active noise stimulation and on another day inactive treatment, not knowing which day the current was active. According to the research institute, the experiments showed that the active noise stimulation improved both the patients\u2019 balance and the combined symptoms.\n\nParkinson\u2019s sufferer Staffan Lindblom said he did not expect any great advances, but would be thankful for anything that would make living with the disease easier.\n\n\u201cI have become hardened in the sense that I do not have too great expectations. But I still believe that something will be found at some point which could be useful. There is extensive research in this field and I hope that it eventually will come up with a result. Not a significant result but a few steps forward would really be appreciated,\u201d he said.\n\nUnfortunately this particular treatment did not work on Lindblom, with Bergquist suspecting there could also be other causes to Lindblom\u2019s balance problems.\n\nBergquist said he hoped the device could treat patients for whom the Levodopa drug, which turns into dopamine in the body and increases levels of the chemical, was not enough.\n\nHe also said they were working on the hypothesis that other diseases which affect the dopamine system, such as ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), could also benefit from this kind of treatment.\n\n\u201cWhat we are hoping for with this device is to find a treatment for movement disorders where Levodopa, Parkinson\u2019s disease where Levodopa is not enough. And in particular in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease where there is problem with gait and balance. But this may not be restricted to Parkinson\u2019s disease, so there may be other conditions with poor balance where you could use electrical stimulation of the vestibular organs, the balance organs to improve balance and gait,\u201d he said.\n\nThe plan is now for the device to be tested in a longer-term study, where patients will be using it at home.

Despite its longtime use, warfarin remains tricky to dose because a person's genetic makeup influences how the drug is processed in the body. Too much warfarin can cause internal bleeding; too little warfarin fails to prevent blood clots.\n\nNow, a new study led by Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis shows that dosing warfarin (Coumadin and others) is safer -- producing fewer adverse events such as hemorrhage -- when key elements of a patient's genetic makeup are considered.\n\nThe research, published Sept. 26 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, reports results from the clinical trial known as GIFT (Genetics Informatics Trial of Warfarin to Prevent Deep Venous Thrombosis).\n\n\"Physicians have been prescribing warfarin since the Eisenhower administration,\" said first author Brian F.

Thousands of patients end up in the emergency department or hospital because of warfarin-induced bleeding. But we continue to prescribe it because it is highly effective, reversible and inexpensive. So our goal is to make warfarin safer. GIFT showed that precision-medicine based on clinical factors and three genes improves the safety of initiating warfarin therapy.\"\n\nPatients in the trial were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group received warfarin dosing based on standard factors such as age, height and weight; the second group was dosed based on these clinical factors plus genetic variants. Participating sites in the trial included Washington University School of Medicine, Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, Intermountain Healthcare, University of Utah, and Rush University Medical Center.\n\nOf the 789 patients who were dosed in the traditional manner, 116 experienced at least one adverse event (14.7 percent). Of the 808 patients whose warfarin dosing was guided by genetic testing, 87 experienced an adverse event (10.8 percent). Compared with patients receiving traditional warfarin dosing, patients dosed with the genetic approach had a 27 percent reduction in adverse events, which was statistically different. The adverse events were bleeding, formation of blood clots in the veins and warfarin overdoses. No patient died during the trial.\n\nEarlier studies looking at whether genetic testing could improve warfarin dosing had produced conflicting results. However, these studies were smaller and considered fewer genes than GIFT. GIFT enrolled 1,600 patients age 65 and older at high risk of blood clots because they underwent hip- or knee-replacement surgeries.\n\nUnlike prior studies, GIFT took into account genetic variants in three genes for 11 days of warfarin therapy. Genetic variants were assessed on a commercial platform called GenMarkDx. Variants in one gene affect vitamin K recycling. Variants in another gene affect warfarin sensitivity. Variants in the third gene alter warfarin metabolism in the liver and can cause an overdose if the dose is not adjusted soon enough.\n\n\"There are additional genetic variants that may help to guide warfarin dosing, especially among patients with African ancestry,\" Gage said. In the future, we hope to quantify how these variants affect warfarin.\"\n\nGage also noted how health-care costs relate to dosing warfarin in a genetically guided manner. \"Although genetic testing is more expensive than clinical dosing, the cost is falling,\" he said. \"In our study, we estimated that genetic testing costs less than $200 per person, which is less than one month of a newer anticoagulant.\"\n\nThis work was supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), grant numbers R01HL097036 and UL1TR000448; the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, grant number CAG-00400N; and GenMarkDx, which supplied instrumentation.\n\nGage BF, Bass AR, Lin H, Woller SC, Stevens SM, Al-Hammadi N, Li J, Rodriguez Jr. T, Miller JP, McMillin GA, Pendleton RC, Jaffer AK, King CR, DeVore B, Porche-Sorbet R, Napoli L, Merritt K, Thompson AM, Hyun G, Anderson JL, Hollomon W, Barrack RL, Nunley RM, Moskowitz G, Davila-Roman V and Eby CS for the GIFT investigators.

A larger part is at this point, we just don't fully understand what the genetic mechanism that leads to autism is.\"\n\nStandard practice is to offer children with autism two tests as a first-line genetic work-up: karyotype and fragile X testing, the researchers said.\n\nIn karyotyping, forms of which have been around since the 1960s, geneticists use a microscope to look for chromosomal abnormalities that are associated with autism, explained Dr. David Miller, a clinical geneticist and assistant director of the Genetics Diagnostic Laboratory at Children's Hospital Boston, which conducted the new research along with Boston's Autism Consortium.\n\nLike karyotyping, CMA also looks for chromosomal abnormalities, but does so at 100 times the resolution of the earlier test, Miller said. CMA, a genome-wide test, can identify sub-microscopic deletions of duplications of DNA sequences, called copy-number variants, known to be associated with autism, he said.\n\n\"Think of chromosomes as a library full of books and each book as a gene,\" Miller said. \"What we look for are shelves of books that have gone missing, which represent a missing fragment of a chromosome, or extra fragments of chromosome, that could contain genes related to autism.\"\n\nWhile both Children's Hospital Boston and Montefiore have offered CMA testing for several years, not all hospitals do, nor does all insurance pay for it, the researchers noted.\n\nThe main purpose of genetic testing of children with autism is to help parents determine if they're at a higher risk of having another child with autism, Marion said.\n\nIf tests pinpoint an autism-related chromosomal abnormality in the child, the parents are then offered testing. If a parent is also found to have the abnormality, geneticists conclude that the couple is at higher risk of having a child with autism. (The precise risk depends on what the variant is.)\n\nBut if the parents don't have the abnormality, geneticists conclude that the deletion or duplication happened by chance, and the parents are probably not at any greater risk of having another child with autism than the general population, Marion said.\n\nStill, there is much geneticists can't tell parents. Between 10 percent and 15 percent of autism cases can be traced to a known genetic cause, the researchers noted. Of that, CMA alone can detect 7 percent of those.\n\nThere are a few other genetic tests that can explain another few percentage points of autism cases.\n\nBut that leaves 85 percent or more families with little explanation for the disorder, Marion said.\n\n\"CMA is better, but it's not great,\" Marion said. \"The vast majority of children who have autism have no identifiable genetic markers that will help in genetic counseling for future pregnancies. That is very frustrating.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more on autism.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story adequately presents the efficacy of three different genetic tests in identifying abnormalities that may be associated with autism\u2014karyotype: 2%; fragile X: 0.5%; CMA: 7%.\u00a0 It would have been helpful to let readers know that not all 933 people included in the study were tested with each of the three tests. According to the results, the CMA tests performed best in females with autistic disorder, but this was not reported. ", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Researchers are hoping that by using a common tool for measuring of brain activity in a new way, they may be one step closer to identifying whether a child is a greater risk for autism.\n\n\"We haven't diagnosed autism at this point,\" says William Bosl, Ph.D., lead author and a research scientist at Children's Hospital Boston. But he says by using an electroencephalogram and new, sophisticated computer programs to analyze the EEGs, he and his co-authors were able to correctly identify with 80% accuracy, which babies were at higher risk for autism and which were not.\n\nScientists have known for quite some time now that the earlier a child with autism gets therapy, the easier it is to improve language and behavioral skills. In 2007, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that all children be screened for autism at the ages of 18 months and 24 months. Here researchers are trying to find markers for autism before a child begins showing signs of autism.\n\nIn a new study published Tuesday in the journal BMC Medicine, scientists studied 79 infants. 46 babies had a brother or sister with known autism, which means they themselves are at an increased risk for the neurodevelopmental disorder that affects about one in 110 children according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The sibling of a child with a confirmed diagnosis of autism has a 1 in 5 chance of also developing the disorder. These infant siblings were compared with 33 infants with no known family history of autism.\n\nThe babies were given EEG's at 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months of age. Researchers strapped a net of 64 electrodes all over a baby's head while it was sitting in its mom's lap and a research assistant was blowing bubbles to hold the child's attention. The electrodes measured actual firings of neurons. The EEG technique is much easier to use because the baby can be awake and moving and wiggling around, says Dr. Geraldine Dawson, chief science officer for the advocacy group Autism Speaks, which partially funded this research. Other brain imaging technologies like magnetic resonance imaging would require a baby to be asleep or sedated because they have to be completely still while the test is being done. \"Nobody wants to sedate a healthy infant,\" says Dawson.\n\nBosl explains that the new computer algorithms that he developed were able to analyze results of the EEG much better than in the past. He said that, judging by the differences in brain activity, he and his colleagues could detect which babies were in the high-risk group. They say they were nearly 100% accurate when the boys were 9 months old. They were most accurate with baby girls at age 6 months. Overall, the biggest differences in brain activity were seen at 9 months \u2013 which is much earlier than when a child typically shows behavioral problems associated with autism. The differences in brain activity were smaller as the babies got older.\n\nDoctors and scientists not connected to the study are intrigued by the results but caution that this is very early research and not something concerned parents can be looking for as a screening tool for their babies any time soon.\n\nSarah Paterson, Ph.D., is the director of the neuroimaging lab at the Center for Autism Research at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. She is also looking for early signs of autism as part of the Infant Brain Imaging Study, but her work focuses on differences in brain structure. Paterson says that if the results out of Boston can be confirmed, \"It's very exciting because finding an early sign for autism is really the holy grail.\" But she cautions that a lot more work needs to be done. \"This study needs to be replicated by their lab and independent scientists,\" she says.\n\nDr. Max Wiznitzer says the researchers have found a \"really fascinating technique, that offers a different way to look at the brain.\" Wiznitzer \u2013 a pediatric neurologist at Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio \u2013 notes that what the study can't tell us is what the differences in brain activity between the two groups of babies actually mean. He, too, is hopeful that further research will provide more concrete information.\n\nBosl says the first children enrolled in his study are now at 2 and 3 years old, which is the age when autism usually is diagnosed. This will now allow the researchers to evaluate them for autism and then look back at the brain activity patterns of the children who do fit the clinical criteria for autism.\n\nBosl acknowledges that if this is very early research, but he believes if the results are confirmed, it may lead to a safe and inexpensive way to detect autism, which would allow intervention before any autistic behaviors appear.\n\n \"It'll change the field, if this works,\" says Bosl. He hopes to expand the number of babies in his study to 200. \"The only thing slowing us down right now is funding.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Nowhere does the story address the significance of this:\u00a0 that the main benefit of this test appears to be that it detected with 80% accuracy during a very small timeframe that a child had an older sibling with autism. This means that the study correctly identified most of the time a risk factor that was already known to the parents of the chlid and to the researchers. So, in effect, the study had no actual benefit for the kids or the parents. At least the HealthDay story paraphrased one independent expert who noted that\u00a0 \u201cthe study predicted who was at high risk of autism, but it\u2019s unknown if those babies actually went on to develop autism\u201d.

Winer, chief of women\u2019s cancers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said that even women who completed their five years of tamoxifen months or years ago might consider starting on the drug again.\n\nTamoxifen blocks the effect of the hormone estrogen, which fuels tumor growth in estrogen receptor-positive cancers that account for about 65 percent of cases in premenopausal women. Some small studies in the 1990s suggested that there was no benefit to using tamoxifen longer than five years, so that has been the standard.\n\nAbout 227,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year in the United States, and an estimated 30,000 of them are in premenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive cancer and prime candidates for tamoxifen. But postmenopausal women also take tamoxifen if they cannot tolerate the alternative drugs, known as aromatase inhibitors.\n\nThe new study, known as Atlas, included nearly 7,000 women with ER-positive disease who had completed five years of tamoxifen. They came from about three dozen countries. Half were chosen at random to take the drug another five years, while the others were told to stop.\n\nIn the group assigned to take tamoxifen for 10 years, 21.4 percent had a recurrence of breast cancer in the ensuing 10 years, meaning the period 5 to 14 years after their diagnoses. The recurrence rate for those who took only five years of tamoxifen was 25.1 percent.\n\nAbout 12.2 percent of those in the 10-year treatment group died from breast cancer, compared with 15 percent for those in the control group.\n\nThere was virtually no difference in death and recurrence between the two groups during the five years of extra tamoxifen. The difference came in later years, suggesting that tamoxifen has a carry-over effect that lasts long after women stop taking it.\n\nWhether these differences are big enough to cause women to take the drug for twice as long remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cThe treatment effect is real, but it\u2019s modest,\u201d said Dr. Paul E. Goss, director of breast cancer research at the Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nTamoxifen has side effects, including endometrial cancer, blood clots and hot flashes, which cause many women to stop taking the drug. In the Atlas trial, it appears that roughly 40 percent of the patients assigned to take tamoxifen for the additional five years stopped prematurely.\n\nSome 3.1 percent of those taking the extra five years of tamoxifen got endometrial cancer versus 1.6 percent in the control group. However, only 0.6 percent of those in the longer treatment group died from endometrial cancer or pulmonary blood clots, compared with 0.4 percent in the control group.\n\n\u201cOver all, the benefits of extended tamoxifen seemed to outweigh the risks substantially,\u201d Trevor J. Powles of the Cancer Center London, said in a commentary published by The Lancet.\n\nDr. Judy E. Garber, director of the Center for Cancer Genetics and Prevention at Dana-Farber, said many women have a love-hate relationship with hormone therapies.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t feel well on them, but it\u2019s their safety net,\u201d said Dr. Garber, who added that the news would be welcomed by many patients who would like to stay on the drug. \u201cI have patients who agonize about this, people who are coming to the end of their tamoxifen.\u201d\n\nEmily Behrend, who is a few months from finishing her five years on tamoxifen, said she would definitely consider another five years. \u201cIf it can keep the cancer away, I\u2019m all for it,\u201d said Ms. Behrend, 39, a single mother in Tomball, Tex. She is taking the antidepressant Effexor to help control the night sweats and hot flashes caused by tamoxifen.\n\nCost is not considered a huge barrier to taking tamoxifen longer because the drug can be obtained for less than $200 a year.\n\nThe results, while answering one question, raise many new ones, including whether even more than 10 years of treatment would be better still.\n\nPerhaps the most important question is what the results mean for postmenopausal women. Even many women who are premenopausal at the time of diagnosis will pass through menopause by the time they finish their first five years of tamoxifen, or will have been pushed into menopause by chemotherapy.\n\nPostmenopausal patients tend to take aromatase inhibitors like anastrozole or letrozole, which are more effective than tamoxifen at preventing breast cancer recurrence, though they do not work for premenopausal women.\n\nMr. Peto said he thought the results of the Atlas study would \u201capply to endocrine therapy in general,\u201d meaning that 10 years of an aromatase inhibitor would be better than five years.

The study found that individuals with the highest levels of blood ceramides were found to have a 3- to 4-times greater risk of having a cardiovascular event compared with those with the lowest ceramide score, regardless of their LDL cholesterol level or the presence of a blockage in the heart\u2019s arteries.\n\n\u201cOur research suggests that evaluating ceramide levels in patients who are not at immediate risk for coronary artery disease events may help cardiologists decide who could benefit from proactive and preventive treatment, such as statins, or lifestyle changes to prevent a serious cardiac event down the road,\u201d says Jeff Meeusen, Ph.D., a clinical chemist, co-director of Cardiovascular Laboratory Medicine at Mayo Clinic and the study\u2019s lead author.\n\nAccording to Dr. Meeusen, ceramides are different than cholesterol, which gathers and causes a clog in the arteries. Ceramides are more active, attracting inflammatory cells and promoting clotting.\n\nIn the study, 499 Mayo Clinic patients who were referred for coronary angiography to check for possible artery blockages were included and followed prospectively for approximately eighteen years. Patients were similar in age and with regard to blood pressure, smoking status and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol; excluded were those who had diabetes or a previous heart attack, stroke or procedure to open narrowed coronary arteries. Researchers measured four different types of ceramides in the blood at baseline and combined the values into a 12-point scale. Patients were grouped into four risk categories according to their ceramide levels: low (0\u20132), intermediate (3\u20136), moderate (7\u20139) and high (10\u201312).\n\nOver the eighteen years, researchers recorded occurrences of heart attack, stroke, revascularization and death. Overall, 5.1 percent of patients had a major cardiovascular event each year. But the risk of having an event became higher as ceramide level increased; for each 1-point increase in the ceramide risk score, the risk rose by 9 percent. The rate of events was double among people with the highest ceramide score compared with those with the lowest (8.1 vs. 4.1 percent, respectively).\n\nIn patients without coronary artery disease following angiography, the rate of cardiovascular events was only 3.1 percent, lower than the average overall. But when researchers examined cardiovascular disease in this population by ceramide scores, people with the highest levels of ceramides were four times more likely to have an event compared with those with the lowest (7.8 vs. 2.2 percent, respectively). A similar trend was seen among people with low LDL levels (<100 mg/dL), typically considered a good LDL target. In this group, the rate of heart attack, stroke and revascularization and death was 3.7 percent among those with a low ceramide score, but 16.4 percent in people with the highest ceramide levels.\n\n\u201cThere is a need to identify patients at increased risk for cardiovascular events so that we can test strategies to prevent those events. This test seems to provide such information,\u201d says Allan S. Jaffe, M.D., senior author of the study, cardiologist at Mayo Clinic and chair of the Division of Clinical Core Laboratory Services.\n\nThe trial was funded by Mayo Clinic. The new test is available to health care providers worldwide through Mayo Medical Laboratories, which offers laboratory testing and pathology services to more than 4,000 health care organizations in more than 70 countries. Mayo Medical Laboratories collaborated with some of the original researchers who established the role of ceramides in cardiovascular disease and Zora Biosciences Oy, a diagnostics discovery company based in Finland, to develop and refine the test. The present study is also the first to test its clinical utility in a U.S. population.\n\nCo-authors are: Leslie Donato, Ph.D.; Sandra Bryant; Grant Spears; Peter Berger, M.D.; and Linnea Baudhuin, Ph.D., all of Mayo Clinic.\n\nAbout Mayo Clinic\n\n Mayo Clinic is a nonprofit organization committed to clinical practice, education and research, providing expert, whole-person care to everyone who needs healing.

The news release does a good job of explaining the likelihood of having a cardiac event for those with low versus high levels of blood ceramides. In particular, it reports both absolute and relative risk, noting that, among individuals with low LDL (bad cholesterol) levels, cardiovascular disease occurred in 3.7% of those with low ceramide levels but in 16.4% of those with high ceramide levels.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Although Vicks VapoRub is often used to fight colds and congestion, there has never been proof of how well it works. Now, new research reported in the journal Pediatrics finds, the combination of camphor, menthol and eucalyptus oils actually does ease cold symptoms and help children suffering from upper-respiratory infections sleep.\n\nIn the study, funded by an unrestricted research grant from Procter & Gamble, makers of Vicks, researchers took 138 children between the ages of 2 and 11, with symptoms like cough, congestion, runny nose and restless sleep that lasted seven days or more. Only children with moderate cough and severe stuffy nose were eligible, and those were divided into three groups.\n\nSome were treated with Vicks, some with a placebo consisting of petroleum jelly and others got no treatment at all. Parents were surveyed the day before treatment about the severity of their child's symptoms. That night, 30 minutes before bedtime, Vicks or petroleum jelly was rubbed onto the child's chest and neck. The next day parents were questioned about their child's symptoms overnight.\n\nChildren in all three groups got better, but those treated with the VapoRub saw the greatest improvement, and parents in this group also had improved sleep, the study found.\n\n\"The American Academy of Pediatrics says the currently available oral cough and cold medications are not effective for children and have the potential for side effects, \" said Dr. Ian Paul, principal investigator and associate professor of pediatrics and public health sciences, Penn State College of Medicine. \"This was based in part on some of the studies that we have conducted at Penn State.

Those parts of the brain soon start to die. A drug called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) dissolves clots and restores blood flow.\n\nMild strokes -- characterized by such symptoms as clumsiness in the hand, weakness of an extremity, some slurred speech, temporary loss of vision, and/or dizziness -- account for more than half of strokes in the U.S.\n\nBut people with mild strokes are typically denied tPA because the studies that established its effectiveness excluded mild cases, says Pooja Khatri, MD, of the University of Cincinnati.\n\nIt's been assumed that people with mild strokes \"generally [do] well and the risk of tPA treatment, which includes a slight but significant risk of life-threatening bleeding in the brain, would not be worth the benefit,\" she says.\n\nIn fact, one in three people who suffer a mild stroke are disabled three months later, Khatri says.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "No, as in \u201cevidence\u201d above, the benefits in the 4 patients are really never explained.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "TUESDAY, Aug. 31, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Women who carry genetic mutations that boost their odds of breast and ovarian cancer can live longer and reduce their cancer risk by having preventive surgery, a new study suggests.\n\nThe surgery in question is drastic: removal of the breasts or ovaries before any signs of cancer have arisen.\n\nHowever, \"what our findings show is that women who choose to have these surgeries will reduce their risk of dying of breast or ovarian cancer by about 70 to 80 percent, which is pretty profound,\" said study senior author Dr. Timothy Rebbeck, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.\n\nThe findings are published in the Sept. 1 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nThe 22-center trial, one of the largest of its kind, studied nearly 2,500 women who were found to have inherited mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.\n\nWomen who carry these mutations have a lifetime risk of breast cancer of anywhere between 56 percent to 84 percent, according to the researchers, whereas the risk for ovarian cancer ranges from 36 percent to 63 percent for BRCA1 mutation carriers and 10 percent to 27 percent for BRCA2 mutation carriers. By contrast, the lifetime risk of breast cancer among women generally is about 12 percent, and for ovarian cancer, it's less than 2 percent.\n\nRoughly half of the women in the study had undergone either mastectomies (surgery to remove their breasts) or salpingo-oophorectomies (surgery to remove the ovaries and fallopian tubes) between 1974 and 2008, in order to proactively lower their risk of cancer. The women were followed for an average of about 3.5 years.\n\nDuring the follow-up period, no breast cancer events occurred in the women who underwent mastectomies, while 7 percent of the women in the group who didn't undergo surgery were diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nIn addition, women who had their ovaries removed lowered their risk of ovarian and breast cancer, and also lived longer than women who didn't have the surgery. For example, over 6 years of follow-up, no ovarian cancer cases were seen among BRCA2 mutation carriers who underwent salpingo-oophorectomy, compared with 3 percent of carriers who did not undergo the procedure, the researchers report.\n\n\"One of the main messages of our study is that salpingo-oophorectomy should be part of any management plan for any woman who is found to have these genetic mutations,\" said Rebbeck. \"There really isn't anything else that can reduce a woman's risk by this much.\"\n\n\"These findings really emphasize how important it is for all women with a family history of early breast or ovarian cancer to undergo genetic testing,\" said Dr. Virginia Kaklamani, co-author of an editorial that accompanied the study. \"I see women all the time who get the genetic test only after they're diagnosed with cancer,\" said Kaklamani, who is director of translational breast cancer research at the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University, in Chicago.\n\nKaklamani added that she hoped the findings would encourage more women to ask their primary care physicians whether they are candidates for genetic counseling.\n\n\"This is a very important study because it gives us more information in order to counsel women at risk,\" said Dr. Daniel Silver, assistant professor of medicine at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School. Silver added that women who are found to carry one of these genetic mutations face \"a very complex set of considerations, so the more hard facts you can give them, the better.\"\n\nAccording to Rebbeck, doctors usually recommend that women who test positive for the genes have their ovaries removed at around age 35, but are okay with putting it off until age 40 if they haven't finished having children. He said the surgery today is often done in an outpatient setting, with the use of laparoscopes, which limits scarring and shortens a patient's recovery time.\n\nFind out more about the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes at the U.S. National Cancer Institute.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "1clip_filelist.xml\" rel=\"File-List\"/>\n\n\n\n \nThis story presents a generally positive portrayal of the benefits of preventive surgery.

All received top-notch asthma treatment, and were randomly assigned to take either Gleevec or a placebo pill once daily during the 6-month trial.\n\nBlood tests showed that Gleevec did reduce mast cell activity in patients, Israel said.\n\nFurther, allergy challenge tests showed a decrease in airway reactivity among patients taking Gleevec, the researchers reported. Airways became less likely to close off after exposure to an allergen.\n\nPhysical examinations showed that people taking Gleevec actually experienced a slight overall widening of their airways, Israel added.\n\n\"There was a small but significant improvement in the airway narrowing in these patients, which we didn't expect because we didn't think the mast cells were necessarily promoting that airway narrowing all the time,\" Israel said.\n\nSide-effects were not as severe as expected, he added. One person dropped out because of a sharp decline in white blood cells, which bounced back after the drug was discontinued. Another person dropped out because of leg cramps associated with the drug.\n\n\"All in all, we were expecting a significantly greater pattern of side-effects, and we didn't see it,\" Israel explained.\n\nAccording to Dr. Len Horovitz, a pulmonary specialist with Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, \"This drug represents a new mechanism for the immune modulation of severe asthma.\" Horovitz was not involved with the study.\n\n\"It has been a while since a new approach and treatment for severe asthma has emerged,\" Horovitz said. \"Further studies will be needed to assess its utility in moderate asthma.\"\n\nPulmonologist Dr. Theodore Maniatis is medical director of Staten Island University Hospital in New York City.

Nearly a quarter of a million people worldwide have leprosy, which causes disfiguration of the skin and mucous membranes as well as progressive and incurable nerve damage. While drug therapy exists for leprosy, it must be taken for many months, has many side effects and often is given too late to reverse the permanent damage caused by the bacterial infection. A viable vaccine to prevent and/or treat leprosy is the next step in the effort to bring this disease to an end.\n\nScientists at IDRI, along with national and international collaborators including the National Hansen's Disease Program and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, with financial support from American Leprosy Missions, have developed a promising leprosy vaccine candidate designed to help treat leprosy and prevent exposed individuals from developing disease and the resulting disabilities. Based on data generated in preclinical studies, the vaccine candidate, called LepVax, has progressed to Phase I clinical testing in the United States, the first stage of safety testing in human volunteers. The clinical trial is focused on safety, as well as evaluating the immune response to the vaccine.\n\n\"While previous attempts have used vaccines primarily developed for other diseases, this is the first totally defined vaccine candidate developed specifically for leprosy, using the latest technologies and offering no less than those exposed to leprosy deserve,\" said Steven Reed, Ph.D., IDRI President, CEO & Founder. \"The leprosy vaccine program at IDRI has benefited greatly from what we've learned in the development of tuberculosis vaccine candidates over the past two decades. Although the bacteria that cause tuberculosis and leprosy are related, leprosy vaccine development posed great challenges. This vaccine represents a unique accomplishment, requiring the most advanced technologies in molecular biology and immunology, and American Leprosy Missions has been there from the beginning.\" IDRI scientists have also developed two vaccine candidates for tuberculosis, both in clinical stages of development.\n\n\"We are thrilled that after 15 years and an investment of over $5.1 million, made possible by our faithful donors and partners, a leprosy-specific vaccine is beginning a Phase I clinical trial,\" says Bill Simmons, President and CEO of American Leprosy Missions. \"We believe this may be the most exciting breakthrough in leprosy treatment since multi-drug therapy, the current treatment for leprosy, was launched in the 1980s. We look forward to this vaccine improving the health outcomes of people diagnosed with leprosy. And, it may be that this vaccine can lead to interruption of the transmission of leprosy all together. What a tremendous legacy this would leave for millions of people worldwide.\"\n\nThe vaccine was developed through significant efforts in screening and identifying M. leprae proteins that trigger an effective immune response. IDRI scientists then produced a fusion of four leprosy proteins, which is combined with IDRI's proprietary immune-stimulating adjuvant (GLA-SE). With recent developments in vaccine technology, IDRI scientists can now induce protective responses even after infection, meaning it could be possible to prevent disease development in people already infected with the leprosy bacterium.\n\n\"This generation of a vaccine to prevent and possibly treat leprosy is the result of years of research. The development has been complicated by the fact that the organism that causes leprosy cannot be grown in culture in the laboratory,\" Reed explained. \"This is a unique example of a vaccine produced by totally synthetic methods.\"\n\nReed added that, without the foresight and support of American Leprosy Missions, there would be no leprosy vaccine candidate. \"The vision and support of American Leprosy Missions has been tremendous as we've worked with them throughout the years, moving from our work in developing a leprosy diagnostic to our current focus on a successful leprosy vaccine,\" he said. \"The progress we've had to date would not have been possible without American Leprosy Missions' financial support and guidance.\" Early results from the Phase I study should be available in 2018, and the partners are currently exploring mechanisms to advance the vaccine through later-phase clinical trials should results from the Phase I study (clinical trial NCT03302897) support further evaluation.\n\nThe vaccine candidate will serve as part of an overall strategy to end leprosy, which will require detection, prevention and treatment. IDRI had developed technology to enable a rapid, affordable, point-of-care diagnostic test, which was funded by NIAID (grant numbers 1R43AI066613-01A1 and 2R44AI066613-02.)\n\nIn addition to IDRI and American Leprosy Missions, a variety of partners are taking part in efforts to eliminate leprosy, including Novartis and the Novartis Foundation. Reed, along with scientists from a variety of scientific organizations recently published \"Innovative tools and approaches to end the transmission of Mycobacterium leprae\" in , outlining what is needed to achieve this goal. Together with scientific, government and NGO partners, the Novartis Foundation develops and implements strategies to help interrupt leprosy transmission, while Novartis donates the treatment for leprosy free of charge.\n\nAbout IDRI: As a nonprofit global health organization, IDRI (Infectious Disease Research Institute) takes a comprehensive approach to combat infectious diseases, combining the high-quality science of a research organization with the product development capabilities of a biotech company to create new diagnostics, drugs and vaccines.

The diet is aimed primarily at people with irritable bowel syndrome, a common condition in which abdominal pain and irregular bowel habits \u2014 with diarrhea, constipation or both \u2014 can wax and wane for years.\n\nFollowers are asked to eliminate, and then try to reintroduce, a long list of foods containing certain carbohydrates that might trigger gas, bloating, pain and diarrhea. FODMAP is an acronym for those carbohydrates: fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols.\n\nThe theory is that FODMAPs, found in many fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy foods and sweeteners, are poorly digested by susceptible people. The undigested carbohydrates can draw extra fluid into the digestive tract and end up in the colon, where they are \u201cfeasted upon\u201d and fermented by gut microbes, leading to all sorts of misery, says Lauren Van Dam, a registered dietitian at the University of Michigan.\n\nIf giving up some foods might lessen that misery, many people are game, she says. \u201cWe have some patients that are literally housebound because they are worried they are going to have an accident or because they have terrible pain,\u201d Van Dam says.\n\nBarbara DeLancey, a 63-year-old registered nurse from Ann Arbor, says she was crippled by 10-times-a-day diarrhea when she agreed to try the diet a year ago. \u201cI was resistant at first because it seemed so restrictive,\u201d she says. She got teary-eyed at the grocery store, seeing all the food she could not have.\n\nBut eventually she learned she could tolerate and add back some favorites, including garlic and apples. She credits the diet, along with medication, with a big reduction in her symptoms, but says \u201cit has not been a miracle cure.\u201d\n\nThe diet has generated enough interest to prompt some food companies to introduce low-FODMAP products \u2014 hoping for a market surpassing that for gluten-free foods, according to some industry reports.\n\nIn 2014, IBS treatment guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology said the diet showed promise, but that the quality of evidence was \u201cvery low.\"\n\nSince then, several studies have strengthened the case for the diet, says guideline co-author Brian Lacy, a professor of medicine and chief of gastroenterology at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, N.H. Still, one study from Sweden showed no advantage over a less-restrictive dietary approach that eliminates fewer foods and stresses changes such as smaller, more frequent meals.\n\n\"The data are not overwhelming,\u201d Lacy says. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s a reasonable thing to try.\u201d\n\nThe largest study so far, with 92 patients, was conducted at University of Michigan. It found that 52% of low-FODMAP patients and 41% of patients on a less-restrictive diet reported \u201cadequate relief.\u201d The difference was not statistically significant, says study co-author William Chey, a professor of gastroenterology. But low-FODMAP patients did get significantly better relief from pain and bloating and greater gains in mood, body image and overall quality of life, he says.\n\nMedications, probiotics, fiber supplements and other approaches still have roles in treating IBS, and no one approach works for all patients, Chey and Lacy say.\n\nIt\u2019s not known if the diet leads to any nutritional deficiencies or keeps working in the long run \u2014 especially for patients who get little support from doctors or dietitians.\n\n\u201cPhysicians are largely administering the diet by giving patients sheets of paper with foods to exclude,\u201d Chey says. Ideally, all would be referred to dietitians, Chey and Lacy agree. But few dietitians are trained in the diet, and insurers typically do not cover the visits, Lacy notes.\n\nWhen patients do make their way to Kate Scarlata, a Boston area registered dietitian who specializes in the diet, the first thing she tells them is that it \u201cis a dietary experiment.

They teach clients strategies such as using (safe) garlic-infused oils, avoiding restaurant sauces and soups and topping salads with oil and vinegar.\n\nHigh- and low-FODMAP food lists are updated frequently at websites and apps run by the University of Michigan and Monash University in Australia.\n\nHere is a sampling from the Michigan site.

Unlike conventional methods of HIV prevention, such as condoms or anti-HIV drugs, the implant takes advantage of some people's natural immunity to the virus.\n\nHIV infects the body by corrupting T cells that are mobilized by the immune system when the virus enters a person's body. When the T cells stay resting and do not attempt to fight the virus they are not infected and the HIV virus is not transmitted between people. When the T cells stay resting, it's referred to as being immune quiescent.\n\n\"We know that some drugs taken orally never make it to the vaginal tract, so this implant could provide a more reliable way to encourage T cells not to respond to infection and therefore more reliably and cheaply prevent transmission,\" said Emmanuel Ho, a professor in the School of Pharmacy at Waterloo. \"What we don't know yet is if this can be a stand-alone option for preventing HIV transmission or if it might be best used in conjunction with other prevention strategies. We aim to answer these questions with future research.\"\n\nHo's implant was inspired by previous research involving sex workers in Kenya. In Kenya, Ho and research partner Keith Fowke of the University of Manitoba, observed that many of these women who had sex with HIV positive clients but did not contract the virus. They later found the women possessed T cells that were naturally immune quiescent.\n\n\"Observing this, we asked ourselves if it was possible to pharmacologically induce immune quiescence with medication that was better assured of reaching the point of infection,\" said Ho. \"By delivering the medication exactly where it's needed, we hoped to increase the chances of inducing immune quiescence.\"\n\nThe implant is composed of a hollow tube and two pliable arms to hold it in place. It contains hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) which is disseminated slowly through the porous material of the tube and absorbed by the walls of the vaginal tract.\n\nThe implants were tested in an animal model and the team observed a significant reduction in T cell activation, meaning that the vaginal tract was demonstrating an immune quiescent state.\n\nThe article recently appeared in the Journal of Controlled Release.", "question": "Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "As stated in the news release:\nThe tool, a vaginal implant, decreases the number of cells that the virus can target in a woman\u2019s genital tract\nTwo problems here.

Notably, participants did not take any MS medications after receiving HDIT/HCT. Other studies have indicated that currently available MS drugs have lower success rates.\n\nThe trial, called HALT-MS, was sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, and conducted by the NIAID-funded Immune Tolerance Network (ITN). The researchers published three-year results from the study in December 2014, and the final five-year results appear online Feb. 1 in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.\n\n\u201cThese extended findings suggest that one-time treatment with HDIT/HCT may be substantially more effective than long-term treatment with the best available medications for people with a certain type of MS,\u201d said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. \u201cThese encouraging results support the development of a large, randomized trial to directly compare HDIT/HCT to standard of care for this often-debilitating disease.\u201d\n\nMS symptoms vary widely and may include motor and speech difficulties, weakness, fatigue and chronic pain. The most common form of MS is relapsing-remitting MS, which is characterized by periods of mild or no symptoms interspersed with symptom flare-ups or relapses. Over years, the disease can worsen and shift to a progressive form.\n\nIn HALT-MS, researchers tested the safety, efficacy and durability of HDIT/HCT in 24 volunteers aged 26 to 52 years with relapsing-remitting MS who, despite taking clinically available medications, experienced active inflammation, evidenced by frequent severe relapses, and worsened neurological disability.\n\nThe experimental treatment aims to suppress active disease and prevent further disability by removing disease-causing cells and resetting the immune system. During the procedure, doctors collect a participant\u2019s blood-forming stem cells, give the participant high-dose chemotherapy to deplete the immune system, and return the participant\u2019s own stem cells to rebuild the immune system. The treatment carries some risks, and many participants experienced the expected side effects of HDIT/HCT, such as infections. Three participants died during the study; none of the deaths were related to the study treatment.\n\nFive years after HDIT/HCT, most trial participants remained in remission, and their MS had stabilized. In addition, some participants showed improvements, such as recovery of mobility or other physical capabilities.\n\n\u201cAlthough further evaluation of the benefits and risks of HDIT/HCT is needed, these five-year results suggest the promise of this treatment for inducing long-term, sustained remissions of poor-prognosis relapsing-remitting MS,\u201d said Richard Nash, M.D., of Colorado Blood Cancer Institute and Presbyterian-St. Luke\u2019s Hospital.

The muscle into which needles deliver vaccine is not nearly as active immunologically.\n\nPatches in the mouse study contained an array of 100 needles, each some 650 microns in length, or about the width of a few strands of human hair. Coated with inactivated flu virus, the patches are pressed manually into the skin, where the microneedles dissolve into bodily fluids.\n\n\"It's a technological approach that makes a lot of sense,\" said Dr. Jan Drutz, a general pediatrician at Texas Children's Hospital who calls needle-phobia common in both kids and adults. \"It would be a wonderful alternative to needles if it truly works in people and is pain free.\"\n\nNeedle-phobia, or trypanophobia, is a recognized medical condition that causes sufferers to avoid medical care.

But you may not want to start a raucous celebration just yet. The beer was effective only if it was nonalcoholic.\n\nRunning a marathon is, of course, punishing to the body, causing muscle soreness and inflammation. Grueling exercise can also weaken the immune system, making athletes susceptible to colds and other ills in the weeks after the event. Some athletes, particularly in Europe, long had downed nonalcoholic beer during hard training, claiming that it helped them to recover, but no science existed to support the practice.\n\nTo study the matter, researchers at the Technical University of Munich approached healthy male runners, most in their early 40s, who were training for the Munich Marathon, and asked if they would \u2014 in the name of science \u2014 be willing to drink a considerable amount of beer. Two hundred seventy-seven men agreed, even when told that the beverage would be nonalcoholic. Only half of the group received the alcohol-free beer, however; the other half got a similarly flavored placebo. No one knew who was drinking what.\n\nAll of the runners downed a liter to a liter and a half \u2014 about two to three pints \u2014 of their assigned beverage every day, beginning three weeks before the race and continuing for two weeks afterward. The scientists, meanwhile, collected blood samples from the men several weeks before the race, as well as immediately before to the start, at the finish line and on select days afterward. (These were an exceptionally obliging group of racers, it seems.) They monitored levels of various markers of inflammation in the men\u2019s blood, to see whether beer helped to blunt some of the immediate damage from running.\n\nFor the next two weeks, the men continued to dutifully swallow their nonalcoholic beer or other brew. They also reported any symptoms of colds or other upper respiratory ailments that developed during that time.\n\nThe men drinking the nonalcoholic beer reported far fewer illnesses than the runners swallowing the placebo beverage. \u201cIncidence of upper respiratory tract infections was 3.25-fold lower\u201d in the nonalcoholic beer drinkers, the scientists reported, in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. They also showed significantly less evidence of inflammation, as measured by various markers in their blood, and lower counts of white blood cells than the placebo group, an indication of overall better immune system health.\n\nThese effects matter, said Dr. Johannes Scherr, lead author of the study, because if a marathon runner\u2019s body is less sore and inflamed after a race, and he doesn\u2019t develop the sniffles, he can recover and return to training more quickly than he otherwise might have been able to. \u201cIt can be speculated that the training frequency could be higher (with shorter breaks after vigorous training sessions)\u201d in those drinking beer, he wrote in an e-mail response.\n\nJust how nonalcoholic beer eases the ravages of strenuous marathon training and racing is still being investigated. But, said Dr. Scherr, it almost certainly involves the beverage\u2019s rich bouquet of polyphenols, chemical substances found in many plants that, among other things, \u201csuppress viral replication\u201d and \u201cinfluence the innate immune system positively,\u201d all beneficial for fighting off a cold.\n\nAlcoholic beer happens to be drenched in polyphenols, too \u2014 \u201ceven more than nonalcoholic beer,\u201d Dr. Scherr said \u2014 but has the signal disadvantage of being alcoholic. \u201cWe do not know whether the side effects of alcoholic beer would cancel out the positive effects caused by the polyphenols,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFurthermore, it is not possible to drink one to one and a half liters of alcoholic beer per day, especially not during strenuous training.\u201d We all knew that, right?\n\nOf course, other substances containing polyphenols have shown early promise, and then underperformed in follow-up studies. Quercetin, for instance, a polyphenol derived principally from apple skins, was widely touted by endurance athletes several years ago after studies found that large doses allowed untrained lab mice to run for far longer than untreated animals. But the supplement has largely failed to show benefits in human athletes. An analysis of 10 human studies of the supplement presented at the American College of Sports Medicine annual meeting in June concluded that quercetin supplementation \u201cis very unlikely to provide an endurance performance advantage.\u201d\n\nBut the beer experiment did not begin by looking at mice. It began with human marathoners completing a punishing, unsimulated race, and showed demonstrable benefits, in terms of minimizing postrace damage.\n\nAll of which is good news as the fall marathon season approaches. Asked if he would recommend that serious marathon runners add nonalcoholic beer to their diets, Dr. Scherr said, \u201cWhen I look at the results of our study, I would have to answer \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible to get large amounts of polyphenols from other foods, he added, like those training-table staples chokeberries and mangosteens, as well as pomegranates and grapes. \u201cBut with these foods you do not consume the minerals, fluid and carbohydrates,\u201d he said, \u201cso nonalcoholic beer seems to be optimal\u201d for everything, perhaps, apart from your well-deserved celebratory carouse after the race.

The current treatment is injection with the drug sumatriptan, but frequent use of the drug isn't recommended because of the risk of adverse effects. High-flow oxygen is also used to treat cluster headaches, but its use is limited because of a lack of good quality controlled studies.\n\nThis new study included 76 adult patients, aged 18 to 70, with either episodic cluster headache (57) or chronic cluster headache (19). During four cluster headache episodes, the patients alternatively received high-flow oxygen (inhaled oxygen at 100 percent, 12 liters per minute, delivered by face mask, for 15 minutes at the start of the attack) or placebo (high-flow air).\n\nThe study found that 78 percent of patients reported being pain-free or having adequate relief within 15 minutes of receiving high-flow oxygen, compared with 20 percent of patients after they received high-flow air. High-flow oxygen also provided better pain relief at 30 and 60 minutes.\n\nNo serious harmful side effects were reported after high-flow oxygen treatment, according to the report published in the Dec. 9 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\n\"To our knowledge, this is the first adequately powered trial of high-flow oxygen compared with placebo, and it confirms clinical experience and current guidelines that inhaled oxygen can be used as an acute attack therapy for episodic and chronic cluster headache,\" wrote Anna S.

", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Every healthy newborn in the United States should receive a new vaccine designed to protect against an intestinal germ called rotavirus, a federal advisory panel decided yesterday as it set aside theoretical concerns about the vaccine's safety.\n\nThe decision means that pediatricians are likely to recommend three doses of the oral vaccine for nearly every child at age 2 months, 4 months and 6 months, beginning almost immediately. The vaccine won approval from the Food and Drug Administration on Feb. 3, and some doctors have received supplies of it.\n\nThe recommendation for universal use of the vaccine was approved at a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the federal panel that sets vaccination policy in the United States. It comes nearly seven years after an earlier rotavirus vaccine was withdrawn from the market for causing a potentially life-threatening form of intestinal blockage in some babies.\n\nVaccine-safety advocates are urging parents to be wary of the new vaccine because of that history. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the manufacturer, Merck & Co. Inc. of Whitehouse Station, N.J., have promised elaborate studies to catch any safety problems. Merck is selling the vaccine under the brand name RotaTeq.\n\nMerck has tested the vaccine in about 70,000 babies in 11 countries, one of the biggest vaccine trials ever conducted. That test ruled out a safety problem similar to the one that felled RotaShield, an earlier rotavirus vaccine developed by Wyeth, a drugmaker in Madison, N.J. But doctors said it is impossible to design a test big enough to catch all possible side effects that might show up once the product is used in millions of children.\n\nRotaTeq \"generally appears to have a better safety profile than the earlier vaccine,\" said Umesh D. Parashar, a medical epidemiologist at the CDC. \"But at the same time it's something we'll continue to look at, and hopefully confirm absence of risk.\"\n\nRotaTeq is expected to be one of the most expensive vaccines ever marketed, with Merck listing it at $187.50 wholesale for the three-dose series. That means many doctors are likely to charge more than $300 retail, putting the Merck product in league with Prevnar, an expensive Wyeth vaccine that has been widely used in the United States for five years. Prevnar, which protects children against certain types of pneumonia, became the first vaccine to meet the pharmaceutical industry's standard for a blockbuster product, with sales exceeding $1 billion a year.\n\nThe development of such high-priced vaccines is causing strains, particularly in state-sponsored vaccination programs for certain low-income children. But it is also drawing new manufacturers into the vaccine market, which many drug companies had abandoned in the 1980s and 1990s, citing too little profit.\n\nRotaShield appeared on the market in late 1998 but was pulled less than a year later after a handful of babies that received it developed a serious intestinal problem called intussusception, a type of bowel obstruction that occurs when the intestine folds in on itself, like a collapsing telescope.\n\nThe problem occurs naturally, albeit rarely; it showed up at a sharply elevated rate in babies who received RotaShield. Intussusception is life-threatening for some babies, though doctors can usually treat it.\n\nMany people have never heard of rotavirus, but it is one of the most common causes of childhood illness -- many ailments that parents or pediatricians describe as \"stomach flu\" are caused by rotavirus infection. Virtually every child in the world contracts the virus repeatedly by age 5, gradually building immunity.\n\nMost children get over rotavirus at home, but at least 55,000 American children are hospitalized every year after becoming dehydrated from vomiting and diarrhea associated with the infection. Fifty to 60 of them die, but it is a different story overseas, where babies often do not receive good medical care and hundreds of thousands die every year.\n\nRotaTeq contains live, but weakened, strains of rotavirus designed to build immunity without causing illness.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "No quantitative estimates of benefit are provided.

The difference came down to the specific type of fats that make up these foods \u2014 animal and dairy fats tend to be saturated, which means all of the free bonds available in a chain of carbon atoms are bound to hydrogen atoms, while plant fats are unsaturated, meaning some of carbon atoms have double bonds with each other. Saturated fats are more likely to build up within artery walls and form plaques that can trigger heart attacks.\n\nBut in the latest study on fats published in the BMJ, researchers found convincing evidence that not all plant fats are created equal and that linoleic acid, or omega-6 fatty acids, may be associated with a higher risk of early death from any cause, as well as increased risk of heart disease and death from heart-related conditions.\n\nThe study is actually a reanalysis of data that had not been included in the original publication of results from the Sydney Diet Heart Study, a trial that was conducted from 1966 to 1973. For more than three years, researchers at the time followed 458 men aged 30 to 59 years old who had a history of heart disease; about half were told to replace the saturated fats they consumed from animal and dairy sources with omega-6 linoleic acid, which is commonly found in safflower oil or margarines made from it. The other half were not told to change their diet in any way. When that study was published in 1978, researchers noted an increased risk of early death from any cause among the omega-6 group, but did not break down the data by what caused the deaths.\n\nSo Dr. Christopher Ramsden, a clinical investigator at the National Institutes of Health, who was interested in understanding the effects of linoleic acid on heart health, contacted one of the original authors and reviewed data that had not been included in the study. This information involved deaths from heart-related causes, and the new analysis showed that the omega-6 group had a 17% higher risk of dying during the study period from heart disease, compared with 11% among the control group.\n\nThe American Heart Association (AHA) currently recommends that people replace 25% to 35% of their daily saturated-fat intake with foods containing unsaturated fats, such as canola and olive oils. The AHA further breaks down the unsaturated-fat advice by suggesting that people devote about 5% to 10% of their daily calories to foods containing linoleic acid. The recommendation is based on a review of the available data.\n\nThe latest results, however, raise questions about that advice. Ramsden says the findings provide some refined understanding of unsaturated fats, which come in different chemical forms that may have varying benefits or risks. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that the [current advice] is necessarily completely wrong,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat happened is that in the 1960s all polyunsaturated fats were considered the same. They were grouped together under one mechanism of being able to lower blood-cholesterol levels. Then, over the ensuing decades, it became clear as science progressed that there were multiple types of polyunsaturated fats, and these compounds potentially have distinct biochemical and health effects.\u201d\n\nThere has been some evidence to suggest that omega-6 fatty acids, for example, may trigger inflammation, a condition that is linked to an increased risk of heart problems, while omega-3 fatty acids, found in deepwater fish like salmon, tend to inhibit inflammatory reactions. Ramsden says the results highlight the need to study dietary ingredients in more detail, rather than lumping them together and assuming they have the same effect on the body.\n\nRecognizing that need, the AHA says it is considering re-evaluating all its dietary recommendations, and will make the issue of polyunsaturated fats part of this assessment. Reviewing the dietary advice as a whole is important, says Alice Lichtenstein, a spokesperson for the association, since changes in one area could have unexpected, and potentially harmful, effects on other eating habits. When health organizations advised people to lower their intake of saturated fats, for example, many replaced the fats with carbohydrates, which can increase risk of diabetes and lead to higher levels of another type of fat in the blood, triglycerides. \u201cOne of the things we learned is that we need to look at the whole picture,\u201d says Lichtenstein. \u201cJust looking at one individual component puts undue emphasis on that component, and may lead to unanticipated consequences. We need to look at dietary patterns rather than individual nutrients or individual food components.\u201d\n\nWhether the association will change its advice about consuming linoleic acid isn\u2019t clear yet, but Ramsden says the results of the latest study \u201ccould have important implications\u201d for the way people eat if they want to stay heart-healthy.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story\u00a0came close to a satisfactory rating here, but couldn\u2019t stick the landing.

Such patients need anticlotting drugs because blood clots can be a deadly complication of getting a stent.\n\nPlavix is the drug most often used to prevent this complication. But there's a problem with Plavix, and with a newer, stronger drug in the same class called Effient.\n\nBoth drugs increase the risk of dangerous bleeding.

(AP Photo/Teresa Crawford)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 It was launched decades ago as an anesthetic for animals and people, became a potent battlefield pain reliever in Vietnam and morphed into the trippy club drug Special K.\n\nNow the chameleon drug ketamine is finding new life as an unapproved treatment for depression and suicidal behavior. Clinics have opened around the United States promising instant relief with their \u201cunique\u201d doses of ketamine in IVs, sprays or pills. And desperate patients are shelling out thousands of dollars for treatment often not covered by health insurance, with scant evidence on long-term benefits and risks.\n\nChicago preschool teacher Lauren Pestikas long struggled with depression and anxiety and made several suicide attempts before trying ketamine earlier this year.\n\nThe price tag so far is about $3,000, but \u201cit\u2019s worth every dime and penny,\u201d said the 36-year-old.\n\nPestikas said she feels much better for a few weeks after each treatment, but the effects wear off and she scrambles to find a way to pay for another one.\n\nFor now, ketamine has not received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating depression, though doctors can use it for that purpose.\n\nKetamine has been around since the 1960s and is widely used as an anesthesia drug during surgery because it doesn\u2019t suppress breathing. Compared to opioids such as morphine, ketamine isn\u2019t as addictive and doesn\u2019t cause breathing problems. And some studies have shown that ketamine can ease symptoms within hours for the toughest cases.\n\nIts potential effects on depression were discovered in animal experiments in the late 1980s and early 1990s showing that glutamate, a brain chemical messenger, might play a role in depression, and that drugs including ketamine that target the glutamate pathway might work as antidepressants.\n\nConventional antidepressants like Prozac target serotonin, a different chemical messenger, and typically take weeks to months to kick in \u2014 a lag that can cause severely depressed patients to sink deeper into despair.\n\nKetamine\u2019s potential for almost immediate if temporary relief is what makes it so exciting, said Dr. Jennifer Vande Voort, a Mayo Clinic psychiatrist who has used ketamine to treat depression patients since February.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of things that provide that kind of effect. What I worry about is that it gets so hyped up,\u201d she said.\n\nThe strongest studies suggest it\u2019s most useful and generally safe in providing short-term help for patients who have not benefited from antidepressants. That amounts to about one-third of the roughly 300 million people with depression worldwide.\n\n\u201cIt truly has revolutionized the field,\u201d changing scientists\u2019 views on how depression affects the brain and showing that rapid relief is possible, said Yale University psychiatrist Dr. Gerard Sanacora, who has done research for or consulted with companies seeking to develop ketamine-based drugs.\n\nBut to become standard depression treatment, he said, much more needs to be known.\n\nLast year, Sanacora co-authored an American Psychiatric Association task force review of ketamine treatment for mood disorders that noted the benefits but said \u201cmajor gaps\u201d remain in knowledge about long-term effectiveness and safety. Most studies have been small, done in research settings and not in the real world.\n\nWhen delivered through an IV, ketamine can cause a rapid increase in heart rate and blood pressure that could be dangerous for some patients. Ketamine also can cause hallucinations that some patients find scary.\n\n\u201cThere are some very real concerns,\u201d Sanacora said. \u201cWe do know this drug can be abused, so we have to be very careful about how this is developed.\u201d\n\nDr. Rahul Khare, an emergency medicine specialist in Chicago, first learned about ketamine\u2019s other potential benefits a decade ago from a depressed and anxious patient he was preparing to sedate to fix a repeat dislocated shoulder.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Doc, give me what I got last time. For about three weeks after I got it I felt so much better,\u2019\u201d Khare recalled.\n\nKhare became intrigued and earlier this year began offering ketamine for severe depression at an outpatient clinic he opened a few years ago. He also joined the American Society for Ketamine Physicians, formed a year ago representing about 140 U.S. doctors, nurses, psychologists and others using ketamine for depression or other nonapproved uses.\n\nThere are about 150 U.S. ketamine clinics, compared with about 20 three years ago, said society co-founder Dr. Megan Oxley.\n\nKhare said the burgeoning field \u201cis like a new frontier\u201d where doctors gather at meetings and compare notes. He has treated about 50 patients with depression including Pestikas. They\u2019re typically desperate for relief after failing to respond to other antidepressants. Some have lost jobs and relationships because of severe depression, and most find that ketamine allows them to function, Khare said.\n\nTypical treatment at his clinic involves six 45-minute sessions over about two weeks, costing $550 each. Some insurers will pay about half of that, covering Khare\u2019s office visit cost. Patients can receive \u201cbooster\u201d treatments. They must sign a four-page consent form that says benefits may not be long-lasting, lists potential side effects, and in bold letters states that the treatment is not government-approved.\n\nAt a recent session, Pestikas\u2019s seventh, she leaned back on a reclining white examining-room chair as a nurse hooked her up to a heart and blood pressure monitor. She grimaced as a needle was slipped into the top of her left palm. Khare reached up with a syringe to inject a small dose of ketamine into an IV bag hanging above the chair, then dimmed the lights, pulled the window curtains and asked if she had questions and was feeling OK.\n\nPestikas listened to music on her iPhone and watched psychedelic videos. She said it was like \u201ca controlled acid trip\u201d with pleasant hallucinations. The trip ends soon after the IV is removed, but Pestikas said she feels calm and relaxed the rest of the day, and that the mood boost can last weeks.\n\nStudies suggest that a single IV dose of ketamine far smaller than used for sedation or partying can help many patients gain relief within about four hours and lasting nearly a week or so.\n\nExactly how ketamine works is unclear, but one idea is that by elevating glutamate levels, ketamine helps nerve cells re-establish connections that were disabled by depression, said ketamine expert Dr. Carlos Zarate, chief of experimental therapies at the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\nA small Stanford University study published in August suggested that ketamine may help relieve depression by activating the brain\u2019s opioid receptors.\n\nJanssen Pharmaceuticals and Allergan are among drug companies developing ketamine-like drugs for depression. Janssen leads the effort with its nasal spray esketamine. The company filed a new drug application in September.\n\nMeanwhile, dozens of studies are underway seeking to answer some of the unknowns about ketamine including whether repeat IV treatments work better for depression and if there\u2019s a way to zero in on which patients are most likely to benefit.\n\nUntil there are answers, Zarate of the mental health institute said ketamine should be a last-resort treatment for depression after other methods have failed.\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

The research team reports that the potential improvement in diagnostic accuracy will spare thousands of patients each year in the United States alone from having to undergo unnecessary surgery.\n\nIn a recent report on ongoing work to improve kidney tumor classification, published in the April issue of the journal Clinical Nuclear Medicine, the team reports that the sestamibi SPECT/CT test\u2014short for 99mTc-sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography(CT) \u2014 adds additional diagnostic information in conjunction with conventional CTs and MRI and improves physicians\u2019 ability to differentiate between benign and malignant kidney tumors.\n\n\u201cSestamibi SPECT/CT lets radiologists and urologists \u2018see\u2019 the most common benign kidney tumor, something CT and MRI have not succeeded in doing alone,\u201d says Mohamad E. Allaf, M.D., MEA Endowed Professor of Urology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \u201cThis noninvasive scan may prevent patients with a potentially benign kidney tumor from having to undergo a surgery to remove the tumor or potentially the entire kidney, along with its associated risks and high costs. At Johns Hopkins, use of this test has already spared a number of our patients from unnecessary surgery and unnecessary removal of a kidney that would require them to be on dialysis. These results are hugely encouraging, but we need to do more studies.\u201d\n\nFor this study, 48 patients who were diagnosed with a kidney tumor on conventional CT or MRI were imaged with sestamibi SPECT/CT at Johns Hopkins prior to surgery. Radiologists, who were not allowed to talk to each other or know the results of the surgeries, graded the conventional and sestamibi SPECT/CT images benign or malignant using a 5-point scale (1 = definitely benign, 5 = definitely cancerous).\n\nFollowing surgery, similarly \u2018blinded\u2019 pathologists analyzed the tumors without knowing the radiologists\u2019 imaging results. Pathology results of surgically removed tumors showed that 8 of the 48 were benign. The remaining 40 were classified as a variety of other tumor types, including malignant renal cell carcinomas.\n\nReviewing sestamibi SPECT/CT scan results in conjunction with CT or MRI changed the initial rating levels from cancerous (score 3, 4, 5) toward benign (score 1 and 2) in 9 cases, and changed reviewers\u2019 score from likely cancerous (score 4) to definitely cancerous (score 5) in 5 cases, or about 10 percent of all cases. The addition of sestamibi SPECT/CT increased the reviewers\u2019 diagnostic certainty in 14 of the 48 patients, or in nearly 30 percent of all cases.\n\nOverall, the investigators said, adding sestamibi SPECT/CT helped identify 7 of 9 benign tumors, and conventional imaging with added sestamibi SPECT/CT outperformed conventional imaging alone, as measured by a statistical analysis that measures tradeoffs between sensitivity and specificity. On this measure, a value of 0.50 indicates that a diagnostic test is no better than chance. Conventional imaging combined with sestamibi SPECT/CT had a value of 0.85, while conventional imaging alone had a value of 0.60.\n\nEven for patients whose tumors were not reclassified, the addition of sestamibi SPECT/CT increased physicians\u2019 ability to more confidently classify malignant tumors, which reduces the risk of misdiagnosis and unnecessary surgery for all patients, the researchers say.\n\nRadiologists and urologists have been frustrated for decades by the inability of conventional imaging tests, such as CT and MRI, to distinguish benign from malignant kidney tumors. At Johns Hopkins, multispecialty teams work together to determine the best care for patients and as partners on research innovations and quality improvement initiatives. \u201cThis collaborative venue enabled two then-residents [Drs. Michael Gorin and Steven Rowe] from different departments and specialties to design a clinical trial based on a few reports in the literature suggesting a potential role for sestamibi SPECT/CT in this diagnostic conundrum, and their hypothesis proved correct,\u201d says Mehrbod Som Javadi, MD, assistant professor of radiology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the senior author on the paper. Pamela T. Johnson, MD, associate professor of radiology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine notes, \u201cthese types of advances are critical to our precision medicine initiative, Hopkins inHealth, designed for individualized patient management, and to our mission of high-value health care, where the highest quality care is safely delivered at the lowest personal and financial cost to the patient.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs radiologists, we have struggled to find noninvasive ways to better classify patients and spare unnecessary surgery, but this has not been easy,\u201d says Steven P. Rowe, M.D., Ph.D., one of the two former residents who developed this approach, and now assistant professor of radiology and radiological science at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \u201cSestamibi SPECT/CT offers an inexpensive and widely available means of better characterizing kidney tumors, and the identical test is now being performed as part of a large trial in Sweden, for which the first results have just recently been published and appear to confirm our conclusions.\u201d\n\nAlthough further study is needed to validate the accuracy of sestamibi SPECT/CT, this test appears to be a less expensive, faster, noninvasive alternative to surgery, says Michael A. Gorin, M.D., the other resident involved in developing this approach and now chief resident with The James Buchanan Brady Urological Institute of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \u201cIn the absence of diagnostic certainty, surgeons tend to remove kidney tumors in an abundance of caution, leading to an estimated 5,600 surgically removed benign kidney tumors each year in the United States.\u201d\n\nOther authors on this paper include, Sara Sheikhbahaei, Christopher S.

When the urge returns, out comes another slap.\n\n\n\nNow imagine those \"slaps\" occurring inside the brain, protecting you in moments of weakness.\n\nIn a report published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Stanford neuroscientists say they've achieved this sort of mind-reading in binge-eating mice. They found a telltale pattern of brain activity that comes up seconds before the animals start to pig out \u2014 and delivering a quick zap to that part of the brain kept the mice from overindulging.\n\nWhether this strategy could block harmful impulses in people remains unclear. For now the path seems promising. The current study used a brain stimulation device already approved for hard-to-treat epilepsy. And based on the new findings, a clinical trial testing this off-the-shelf system for some forms of obesity could start as early as next summer, says Casey Halpern, the study's leader and an assistant professor of neurosurgery at Stanford. He thinks the approach could also work for eating disorders and a range of other addictive or potentially life-threatening urges.\n\nAs a physician-researcher, Halpern specializes in deep brain stimulation (DBS), a surgical treatment in which battery-powered implants send electrical pulses to brain areas where signals go awry.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has approved DBS therapy for movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, tremor and dystonia \u2014 usually in people who haven't responded well to medications. Occasionally DBS is a last-resort treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\n\nAnother study published Monday in PNAS suggests that DBS could help boost memory and other research is exploring its use for substance abuse and other reward-seeking behaviors.\n\nYears ago, the Stanford team developed a mouse model to test if DBS could curb overeating. Granted, mice don't normally gorge themselves. Yet if offered fattier, tastier chow each day for just an hour, within 10 days the mice realize if they \"don't eat this now, that guy's coming back to take it away,\" Halpern says. So the animals learn to binge.\n\nBut when the researchers applied DBS stimulation to a part of the brain's reward circuit known as the nucleus accumbens, the mice quit stuffing themselves.\n\nTrouble is, the moderation wore off in a few days, and the DBS also interfered with the animals' social behavior. That got Halpern thinking about a newer system \u2014 one that doesn't stimulate continuously, like DBS, but switches on briefly only after sensing a trouble signal, much like a pacemaker monitors and responds to abnormal heart rhythms.\n\nIn 2013, the FDA approved a newer-generation device, known as a responsive neurostimulation system (RNS), that does just that. Implanted within the brain, it senses early epileptic seizures and slows their spread with small zaps to the onset area. The RNS system costs around $40,000. But with medical devices, Halpern says, hospitals pay for the hardware and insurance companies often cover the surgery, if clinical trial data are good and the treatment is FDA approved. In the current study, Halpern and coworkers tested the RNS device in the binging mice.\n\nFirst, they looked for a biomarker \u2014 an electrical blip that appears in the brain just before the animal reaches for fatty food. Next, the researchers programmed the stimulator to deliver a 10-second pulse whenever it detects this biomarker. They rigged some mice to this intermittent stimulator. For comparison, other animals got continuous DBS stimulation or random pulses.\n\nThe intermittent system controlled overeating much better than the continuous or random protocols \u2014 and nearly as well as in a separate group of mice that got zapped manually by a researcher watching their behavior on video. Plus, the treatment seemed specific to the food addiction. It did not affect anticipation associated with normal behaviors such as meeting a new mouse.\n\nThe results point to a real-time biomarker for impulsive behavior, says Dennis Turner, a Duke University neurosurgeon who was not involved in the study but wrote an October review about ongoing research on a range of potential brain stimulation biomarkers. \"That's the clear novelty.\"\n\nFiguring out if this biomarker would also work in people is challenging. Few are willing to undergo brain surgery for the purpose of research. But Halpern had a rare opportunity. One of his patients developed OCD so debilitating that he opted for DBS. He agreed to have his brain recorded during the surgery. Since food isn't allowed in the operating room, the researchers monitored the patient's brain as he anticipated payoffs in a computerized money-making task. As reported in the PNAS paper, the characteristic anticipatory signal appeared when he expected to make $5 but not for smaller sums, suggesting some level of specificity.\n\nOf course, it's hard to conclude much from a single subject. But from other research \"we know it's safe to place an electrode in the nucleus accumbens, it's safe to stimulate it electrically, and we expect to be able to tune [the electrode] as we already do with DBS. So it seems like a nice opportunity,\" says Halpern, noting that addictive disorders haven't had new therapies for decades. \"I'm motivated by the clinical need.\"\n\nEsther Landhuis is a freelance science journalist in the San Francisco Bay Area.

This rare genetic defect causes severe visual impairment beginning in infancy and can eventually lead to blindness. The company believes the total \"population in the US, Europe and select additional markets in the Americas and Asia/Pacific is up to approximately 6,000 individuals\" who have the mutation targeted by Luxturna, explained Monique da Silva, a spokeswoman for Spark Therapeutics.\n\nThe drug will be available in the United States in early spring, with an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 people in the US standing to benefit from this treatment, according to Spark.\n\nLuxturna is only the third gene therapy approved for use in the United States; two others were also approved in 2017. This is the first to correct an inherited genetic mutation.\n\nLuxturna is a liquid that is injected directly into the eye with a microscopic needle during a surgical procedure. The drug supplies a third gene -- a normal RPE65 gene -- to cells in the retina, a layer of tissue lining the back of the eye. This third version of the gene does not remove or replace the two mutated genes causing the disease, which remain inside the cells. However, the normal gene delivered by the treatment is able to function within the retinal cells and correct vision problems.\n\nIn the phase 3 clinical trial, 27 out of 29 participants -- 93% -- who received the gene therapy demonstrated a gain in functional vision as assessed by a mobility test performed in a maze, according to the company. Risks of the treatment include cataracts, elevated eye pressure, retinal tears and holes and inflammation.\n\nThe company's offer of unusual payer models, including rebates and installment payments, will \"help ensure patients' individual financial situation does not hinder access to treatment,\" da Silva said.\n\n\"New technologies such as gene and cell therapies hold out the potential to transform medicine,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a statement announcing the August approval of Kymriah, considered to be the first gene therapy to be approved for the US market.\n\nKymriah is a leukemia treatment made by pharmaceutical giant Novartis. Similar to Luxturna, Kymriah is a one-time treatment, and its price tag is $475,000.

Instead, measuring visual acuity, such as the ability to read different-sized letters, is more common.

But the results came back the same: His lethal leukemia had been wiped out by an experimental treatment never before used in humans.\n\n\u201cWe were hoping for a little improvement,\u201d remembered the 72-year-old retired New Jersey corrections officer, who had battled the disease for a decade. He and his oncologist both broke down when she delivered the good news in 2010. \u201cNobody was hoping for zero cancer.\u201d\n\nThe pioneering therapy administered to Ludwig and a few other adults at the University of Pennsylvania hospital paved the way for clinical trials with children. Six-year-old Emily Whitehead, who was near death, became the first pediatric recipient in 2012. Like Ludwig, she remains cancer-free.\n\nSuch results are why the treatment is on track to become the first gene therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration. An FDA advisory committee will decide Wednesday whether to recommend approval of the approach, which uses patients\u2019 own genetically altered immune cells to fight blood cancers.\n\nIf the panel gives the nod, the agency probably will follow suit by the end of September. That would open the latest chapter in immunotherapy \u2014 \u201ca true living drug,\u201d said Penn scientist Carl June, who led its development.\n\nThe CAR T-cell treatment, manufactured by the drug company Novartis, initially would be available only for the small number of children and young adults whose leukemia does not respond to standard care. Those patients typically have a grim prognosis, but in the pivotal trial testing the therapy in almost a dozen countries, 83 percent of patients went into remission. A year later, two-thirds remained so.\n\nAnd childhood leukemia is just the start for a field that has attracted intense interest in academia and industry. Kite Pharma of Santa Monica, Calif., has applied for FDA approval to treat aggressive non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, and a similar Novartis application is close behind. Researchers also are exploring CAR T-cell therapy\u2019s use for multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the disease that afflicted Ludwig. They are also tackling a far more difficult challenge \u2014 using the therapy for solid tumors in the lungs or brain, for example.\n\nThe excitement among doctors and researchers is palpable. \u201cWe\u2019re saving patients who three or four years ago we were at our wit\u2019s end trying to keep alive,\u201d said Stephen Schuster, the Penn oncologist who is leading a Novartis lymphoma study. That study and a Kite trial have shown that the treatment can put about one-third of adults with advanced disease \u2014 those who have exhausted all options \u2014 into remission.\n\nYet along with the enthusiasm come pressing questions about safety, cost and the complexity of the procedure.\n\nIt involves extracting white blood cells called T cells \u2014 the foot soldiers of the immune system \u2014 from a patient\u2019s blood, freezing them and sending them to Novartis\u2019s sprawling manufacturing plant in Morris Plains, N.J. There, a crippled HIV fragment is used to genetically modify the T cells so they can find and attack the cancer. The cells then are refrozen and sent back to be infused into the patient.\n\nOnce inside the person\u2019s body, the T-cell army multiplies astronomically.\n\nNovartis has not disclosed the price for its therapy, but analysts are predicting $300,000 to $600,000 for a one-time infusion. Brad Loncar, whose investment fund focuses on companies that develop immunotherapy treatments, hopes the cost does not prompt a backlash. \u201cCAR-T is not the EpiPen,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is truly pushing the envelope and at the cutting edge of science.\u201d\n\nThe biggest concerns, however, center on safety. The revved-up immune system becomes a potent cancer-fighting agent but also a dangerous threat to the patient. Serious side effects abound, raising concerns about broad use.\n\n\u201cTreating patients safely is the heart of the rollout,\u201d said Stephan Grupp of Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, who as director of the hospital\u2019s cancer immunotherapy program led early pediatric studies as well as Novartis\u2019s global trial. \u201cThe efficacy takes care of itself, but safety takes a lot of attention.\u201d\n\nOne of the most common side effects is called cytokine release syndrome, which causes high fever and flulike symptoms that in some cases can be so dangerous that the patient ends up in intensive care. The other major worry is neurotoxicity, which can result in temporary confusion or potentially fatal brain swelling. Juno Therapeutics, a biotech firm in Seattle, shut down one of its CAR T-cell programs after five patients died of brain swelling. Novartis has not seen brain swelling in its trials, company officials said.\n\nTo try to ensure patient safety, Novartis is not planning a typical product rollout, with a drug pushed as widely and aggressively as possible. The company instead will designate 30 to 35 medical centers to administer the treatment. Many of them took part in the clinical trial, and all have gotten extensive training by Grupp and others.\n\nGrupp said he and his staff learned about the side effects of CAR T-cell therapy \u2014 and what to do about them \u2014 through terrifying experiences that began five years ago with Emily Whitehead.\n\nThe young girl, who had relapsed twice on conventional treatments for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, was in grave condition. Grupp suggested to her parents that she be the first child to get the experimental therapy.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Surely, this has been tried on kids somewhere else in the world,\u2019 \u201d recalled her father, Thomas Whitehead of Philipsburg, Pa. \u201cBut Steve said, \u2018Nope, some adults got it, but that was a different kind of leukemia.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAfter she received the therapy, Emily\u2019s fever soared, her blood pressure plummeted, and she ended up in a coma and on a ventilator for two weeks in the hospital\u2019s intensive care unit. Convinced his patient would not survive another day, a frantic Grupp got rushed lab results that suggested a surge of the protein Interleukin 6 was causing her immune system to relentlessly hammer her body. Doctors decided to give Emily an immunosuppressant drug called tocilizumab.\n\nShe was dramatically better within hours. She woke up the next day, her seventh birthday. Tests showed her cancer was gone.\n\nThe approval of CAR T-cell therapy would represent the second big immunotherapy advance in less than a decade. In 2011, the FDA cleared the first agent in a new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors. It has approved five more since then.\n\nThere are big differences between the two approaches. The checkpoint inhibitors are targeted at solid tumors, such as advanced melanoma and lung and bladder cancer, while CAR T-cell therapy has been aimed at blood disorders. And although checkpoint inhibitors are off the shelf, with every patient getting the same drug, CAR T-cell therapy is customized to an individual. Many immunotherapy experts think the greatest progress against cancer will be achieved when researchers figure out how to combine the approaches.\n\nFor the Penn team, the CAR T-cell story goes back decades, starting at the then-National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., where June and a postdoctorate fellow named Bruce Levine worked on new HIV treatments. In the process, they figured out a way to turbocharge T cells to make them more powerful and plentiful.\n\nThe pair moved to Philadelphia in 1999 and dove into cancer research. Two years later, June\u2019s wife died of ovarian cancer, something he has credited as spurring him to work even harder in the field. In the years that followed, researchers across the country, including at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, racked up an array of tantalizing discoveries involving T cells.\n\nFast-forward to 2010, when Ludwig, who lives in Bridgeton, N.J., became Penn\u2019s first patient to receive CAR T-cell therapy. Two other men got the treatment not long after. One is still in remission; the other relapsed and died.\n\nBut after those three patients, the Penn researchers ran out of money for more treatments. To try to raise interest and funding, they decided to publish the results of their work. The article that appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine in August 2011 created a \u201cfirestorm,\u201d June said \u2014 one that brought them new resources. David Porter, a Penn oncologist working with June, was on vacation in western Maryland and had to stop at a Kohl\u2019s to buy a dress shirt for the immediate TV interviews.\n\nThe pediatric trial opened the following spring with Emily. Six months later, Penn licensed its technology to Novartis in exchange for financial support, which included a new on-campus cell-manufacturing facility.\n\nWith FDA approval seeming imminent, the researchers who were so instrumental in the therapy\u2019s development and testing are almost giddy. Grupp is especially pleased that the advance will be available first to children. \u201cUsually everything is developed first for adults,\u201d he noted recently, \u201cand children are an afterthought.\u201d\n\n\u2018This is not the end\u2019: Using immunotherapy and a genetic glitch to give cancer patients hope\n\nThis 8-year-old is free of cancer \u2014 for now \u2014 after a \u2018breakthrough\u2019 treatment\n\nFor a 6-year-old with cancer, a future staked on medicine\u2019s hottest field", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "This is satisfactory, but barely.

It found that bariatric surgery:\n\u2022 produced a mean weight loss of more than 100 pounds\n\nCHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., Oct. 1, 2015 - A study evaluating the effects of bariatric surgery on obese women most at risk for cancer has found that the weight-loss surgery slashed participants' weight by a third and eliminated precancerous uterine growths in those that had them. Other effects included improving patients' physical quality of life, improving their insulin levels and ability to use glucose - which may reduce their risk for diabetes - and even altering the composition of their gut bacteria.\n\nThe study speaks both to the benefits of bariatric surgery and to the tremendous toll obesity takes on health. \"If you look at cancers in women, about a fifth of all cancer deaths would be prevented if we had women at normal body weight in the U.S.,\" said Susan C. Modesitt, MD, of the University of Virginia Cancer Center. \"When you're looking at obesity-related cancers, the biggest one is endometrial cancer, but also colon cancer, breast cancer, renal cancer and gall bladder cancer. We think about 40 [percent] to 50 percent of all endometrial cancer, which is in the lining of the uterus, is caused by obesity.\"\n\nThe study looked at 71 women with a mean age of 44.2 years and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 50.9. Women are considered obese at a BMI of 30 and morbidly obese at 40 (which is typically about 100 pounds over a woman's ideal body weight), yet almost a third of women presenting for bariatric surgery did not identify themselves as obese.\n\nThe study looked at the effects of bariatric surgery in a relatively short timeframe, one to three years after surgery. A total of 68 participants underwent the procedure; two opted out of the surgery, and another died of a heart condition prior to surgery. The effects of surgery on body weight were dramatic: Mean weight loss was more than 100 pounds.\n\nTen percent of study participants who had not had a hysterectomy showed precancerous changes in the lining of the uterus, and all of those resolved with weight loss. \"We're talking about small numbers, really tiny numbers\" of study participants, Modesitt said, noting one limitation of the study. \"So I could never say that effect is definitive, but it is suggestive, given that we know already the incredibly strong link between endometrial cancer and obesity.\"\n\nModesitt, of the UVA's Division of Gynecologic Oncology in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, was most surprised by the dramatic changes seen in the patients' metabolic profiles derived from the gut microbiome, the population of microorganisms living inside us. \"The study results demonstrate that there is a huge alteration, but I don't even know what to say about that, except it is really new and intriguing area to look at in the link between obesity and cancer. For example, before groundbreaking work by Dr. John Marshall at UVA in the past, no one knew that ulcers were from bacteria. Who knows what role the gut bacteria play in promoting obesity, but metabolic parameter/markers of the bacteria definitely changed after [study participants] lost weight.\"\n\nWhile the study speaks to the transformative effect bariatric surgery can have, Modesitt urged people to avoid gaining weight in the first place and for those seeking to lose weight to exercise and eat more healthily before turning to surgery. \"We really should be working on diet and exercise from the get-go in our entire society, starting with our children. And exercise does seem to be protective -- even if you don't lose all the weight, it absolutely has beneficial effects,\" she said. \"There are lots of studies showing if you exercise, it improves your insulin, your glucose, all of those sorts of things that go along with the cancer-causing effect. Almost everybody agrees adding exercise would be wonderful and improve health on many levels. But losing excess weight would also be good.\"\n\nThe findings have been published as a lead article in the scientific journal Gynecologic Oncology. The article was written by Modesitt, Peter T.

And the risk of severe ROP seemed to be reduced by 90 percent, the researchers added.\n\n\"Human milk feeding potentially plays a strong role in protecting very preterm newborns from any-stage ROP and severe ROP,\" the international team of study authors wrote.\n\nRetinopathy of prematurity causes blood vessels to grow in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue in the back of the eye. When the vessels grow, they can cause the retina to detach, destroying vision, according to the U.S. National Eye Institute.\n\nFor the study, researchers from China, Canada and the United Kingdom reanalyzed the results of five published studies on ROP. The studies included more than 2,200 preterm infants, comparing how often babies had been fed human milk or formula, and whether or not they developed ROP.\n\nHowever, the new analysis only showed an association between breast milk and a reduced risk of ROP. It did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship due to the study's design.\n\nResults of the study were published online Nov. 16 in Pediatrics.\n\nExtremely preterm babies are most at risk of ROP. In the United States, 59 percent of babies born at 22 to 28 weeks have the disorder, said study researcher Dr. Chao Chen, a neonatologist at Children's Hospital of Fudan University, in Shanghai. He added that in China, a previous study showed the incidence of ROP was 50 percent in infants with a birth weight under 1,000 grams (2.2 pounds).\n\nROP \"has become a leading cause of childhood blindness in recent time,\" Chen said. \"In general, there are more ROP cases in developed countries, but more severe cases and higher rates of blindness in developing countries.\"\n\nThe greater incidence of ROP is likely due to the increasing survival rate of very preterm babies in developed countries, according to Chen. In developing countries, preterm babies are less likely to survive. When they do, the screening and treatments are not as good, Chen said, so blindness may be more likely.\n\nBabies in the studies had a range of gestational ages, from 26 to about 30 weeks. Their weights ranged from about 1.7 pounds to about 3 pounds. No information was given about how long the breast-feeding continued.\n\nIn re-evaluating the studies, Chen's team found that breast-feeding in any amount appeared to reduce the risk of ROP. And it appeared that the more breast milk, the better. Exclusive breast-feeding seemed to drop the odds of ROP by 75 percent compared to exclusive formula use. And any breast-feeding appeared to reduce the odds of the serious eye disease by 46 percent, the research showed.\n\nHow might human milk offer protection from the eye disorder? The antioxidants in human milk may help, Chen said. Human milk also has immune-protective properties, the researchers said. Breast-feeding also seems to help prevent two conditions known as sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis that may require oxygen therapy, which has also been linked to a higher risk of ROP, the study authors said.\n\nDr. Adolfo Llanos, a neonatologist at Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami, who was not involved with the new study, said the \"quality of this analysis is very good. It's reassuring to see the benefit we see with breast milk.\"\n\nHe said breast milk may help by reducing inflammation in the body. \"Preemies don't regulate inflammation in their bodies well,\" he said.\n\nLlanos cautioned that the study looked only at a mother's own breast milk, not donor milk, which can be used when the biological mother doesn't have enough of her own breast milk.\n\nThe takeaway from this study, Llanos said, is to breast-feed as long as possible, if possible.\n\nTo learn more about breast-feeding, visit American Academy of Pediatrics.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "There are a couple of improvements we recommend here.\u00a0First, we wish that the drop in odds of ROP had been reported more precisely, as there\u00a0are many different combinations of variables\u00a0being compared in the study.

For each level\u00a0of ROP, the study makes the following comparisons:\nOut of the four comparisons, the drop in odds of ROP (any-stage or severe) of\u00a0breast milk versus formula is the most eye-catching\u00a0in the fourth\u00a0comparison. This also happens to be the comparison\u00a0reported in the second paragraph of the article.\u00a0While we do not wish to presume this comparison was cherry-picked, we feel that if word count had been a factor in limiting the reporting of only one comparison above, the second comparison is the one that should have been reported. This is because the sample size is largest for the second comparison, giving more credence (or as statisticians might say, more power) to the numbers.\nMore precision is also warranted regarding the specific comparison being made. The statistics cited in the second paragraph\u00a0fail\u00a0to mention that the comparison is between\u00a0exclusive human milk and exclusive formula.\u00a0Later in the article, two more statistics, a 75% drop and 46% drop in the odds of ROP, are cited. Here, it would\u2019ve been good to qualify the statistic by stating that these numbers relate to drops in any-stage ROP.

Physical therapy can be just as good for a common injury and at far less cost and risk, the most rigorous study to compare these treatments concludes.\n\nTherapy didn't always help and some people wound up having surgery for the problem, called a torn meniscus. But those who stuck with therapy had improved as much six months and one year later as those who had arthroscopic surgery right away, researchers found.\n\n\"Both are very good choices. It would be quite reasonable to try physical therapy first because the chances are quite good that you'll do quite well,\" said one study leader, Dr. Jeffrey Katz, a joint specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.\n\nHe was to discuss the study Tuesday at an American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons conference in Chicago. Results were published online by the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nA meniscus is one of the crescent-shaped cartilage discs that cushion the knee. About one-third of people over 50 have a tear in one, and arthritis makes this more likely. Usually the tear doesn't cause symptoms but it can be painful.\n\nWhen that happens, it's tough to tell if the pain is from the tear or the arthritis \u2014 or whether surgery is needed or will help. Knee surgery for a torn meniscus is done about half a million times each year in the U.S.\n\nThe new federally funded study compared surgery with a less drastic option. Researchers at seven major universities and orthopedic surgery centers around the U.S. assigned 351 people with arthritis and meniscus tears to get either surgery or physical therapy. The therapy was nine sessions on average plus exercises to do at home, which experts say is key to success.\n\nAfter six months, both groups had similar rates of functional improvement. Pain scores also were similar.\n\nThirty percent of patients assigned to physical therapy wound up having surgery before the six months was up, often because they felt therapy wasn't helping them.

Therapy \"is a reasonable first strategy, with surgery reserved for the minority who don't have improvement,\" Rachelle Buchbinder of Monash University in Melbourne wrote in a commentary in the medical journal.\n\nAs it is now, \"millions of people are being exposed to potential risks associated with a treatment that may or may not offer specific benefit, and the costs are substantial,\" she wrote.\n\nSurgery costs about $5,000, compared with $1,000 to $2,000 for a typical course of physical therapy, Katz said.\n\nOne study participant \u2014 Bob O'Keefe, 68, of suburban Boston \u2014 was glad to avoid surgery for his meniscus injury three years ago.\n\n\"I felt better within two weeks\" on physical therapy, he said. \"My knee is virtually normal today.\" He still does the recommended exercises several times a week.\n\nRobert Dvorkin had both treatments for injuries on each knee several years apart. Dvorkin, 56, director of operations at the Coalition for the Homeless in New York City, had surgery followed by physical therapy for a tear in his right knee and said it was months before he felt no pain.\n\nThen, several years ago, he hurt his left knee while exercising. \"I had been doing some stretching and doing some push-ups and I just felt it go 'pop.'\" he recalls. \"I was limping. It was extremely painful.\"\n\nAn imaging test showed a less severe tear and a different surgeon recommended physical therapy. Dvorkin said it worked like a charm \u2014 he avoided surgery and recovered faster than from his first injury. The treatment involved two to three hour-long sessions a week, including strengthening exercises, balancing and massage.

They hope the technology can be commercialized and marketed to prevent the spread of seasonal flu in public places, such as schools, hospitals, and airports.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known for a century that UV light is extremely efficient at killing microbes, bacteria, and viruses,\u201d says study leader David Brenner, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. For that reason, UV devices are often used for sterilization \u2014 for medical equipment in hospitals, for example, or drinking water for backcountry campers.\n\nBut conventional germicidal lamps aren\u2019t safe for humans to be around. With prolonged exposure, they can cause skin cancer and cataracts in the eyes. \u201cSo up until now, they\u2019re only really practical when people aren\u2019t around,\u201d say Brenner. \u201cYou can sterilize a hospital room, but not when anyone\u2019s inside.\u201d\n\nAbout five years ago, Brenner says, the Columbia team came up with a potential solution. Light on the far end of the UV-C spectrum, known as far-UVC, has very short wavelengths. The researchers suspected that it can penetrate and destroy microscopic bacteria and viruses, but can\u2019t travel through the protective outer layers of human skin or eyes.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to get all the benefits of UV light in terms of killing microbes, but none of the health hazards,\u201d says Brenner. Earlier studies, on animals and humans, have shown that exposure to far-UVC light does indeed appear to be safe. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any biological damage to skin cells or eye cells, whereas with conventional UV light we\u2019ve always seen lots of biological damage,\u201d he says. Previous research has also shown that far-UVC light can kill MRSA bacteria, a common cause of infections after surgery.\n\nNow, Brenner and his colleagues have show that UVC light can effectively kill airborne influenza. In their new study, aerosolized particles of the H1N1 seasonal flu virus were released into a test chamber and exposed to very low doses of far-UVC light. The light inactivated the viruses with about the same efficiency as conventional germicidal UV light, while a control group of bacteria not exposed to light remained active.\n\n\u201cWe think that this type of overhead light could be efficacious for basically any public setting,\u201d says Brenner. \u201cThink about doctor\u2019s waiting rooms, schools, airports and airplanes\u2014any place where there\u2019s a likelihood for airborne viruses.\u201d And unlike the flu vaccine, he says, far-UVC light is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes, including newly emerging virus strains.\n\nBrenner says his team is working with a company to develop a commercially available version of the lamp, which could become a cost-effective way to battle flu epidemics on a population level. \u201cThe lamp we\u2019re using at the moment costs less than $1,000, and you can imagine that if it were put into general circulation, the price would drop dramatically,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t see cost as being a limiting factor here.\u201d\n\nUVC lamps could also have potential implications in clinical settings, as well \u2014 in the operating room during surgeries, for example. \u201cNo matter how well you sterilize a room beforehand, the medical staff can still bring in dangerous bacteria like MRSA,\u201d says Brenner. \u201cIf you have a lamp over the surgical site that can sterilize the air, you can prevent the bacteria from floating down and contaminating the wound.\u201d\n\nBrenner can\u2019t predict how long it might take for these lamps to be commercially available, but he says he\u2019s \u201cextremely optimistic\u201d about the technology. \u201cThere has been no way of killing viruses in the air in public spaces, and this is an approach that may solve that problem.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "We\u2019re told: \u201c\u2026 aerosolized particles of the H1N1 seasonal flu virus were released into a test chamber and exposed to very low doses of far-UVC light.

The Oncotype DX DCIS Score result provides patients with an individualized estimate of local (in the same breast) recurrence, which could be either invasive breast cancer or DCIS. This information helps physicians and patients personalize treatment decisions to potentially spare women with low risk of recurrence additional treatment they may not need, while identifying women with a higher risk of recurrence who may need additional treatment after surgery.\n\nConducted in collaboration with Partnership for Health Analytic Research, this prospective study analyzed 115 patients from 10 cancer centers in the United States. The results showed that physician treatment recommendations changed for 31 percent of patients after receiving the DCIS Score result, reducing the number of patients receiving a radiotherapy recommendation by approximately one-third. Importantly, of the patients initially recommended not to receive radiotherapy, 32 percent were identified as having a high risk of recurrence and recommended to have radiotherapy. Physicians in this study rated the DCIS Score as the most important factor in planning treatment compared with pathologic features, patient preference, patient age, comorbidities or consultation with other physicians.\n\n\"The Oncotype DX DCIS Score result was validated in two studies including nearly 900 patients and is the only genomic test for patients with pre-invasive breast cancer,\" said Phil Febbo, M.D., chief medical officer, Genomic Health. \"The publication of this clinical utility study clearly demonstrates that the Oncotype DX DCIS Score can play a key role in enhancing cancer care for patients with DCIS, and we believe that these results will support expanded adoption of and access to the DCIS Score.\"\n\nAbout Oncotype DX\u00ae\n\nThe Oncotype DX\u00ae portfolio of breast, colon and prostate cancer tests applies advanced genomic science to reveal the unique biology of a tumor in order to optimize cancer treatment decisions. The company's flagship product, the Oncotype DX breast cancer test, has been shown to predict the likelihood of chemotherapy benefit as well as recurrence in invasive breast cancer. Additionally, the test predicts the likelihood of recurrence in a pre-invasive form of breast cancer called DCIS. With half a million patients tested in more than 80 countries, the Oncotype DX tests have redefined personalized medicine by making genomics a critical part of cancer diagnosis and treatment.

But doctors say they should: these veins are not just a cosmetic problem, but can also lead to aches, pain, and heaviness from blood pooling in the legs.\n\nThe treatment known as sclerotherapy \u2014 an alternative to surgery \u2014 entails injecting a solution to irritate and collapse vein walls, so the vein eventually disappears. A series of sessions is usually required for a large area.\n\nVein specialists across the country often inject one of two drugs. One, sodium tetradecyl sulfate, or STS, has long been F.D.A. approved. The other, polidocanol, had not been legal, although some doctors used it, importing it from abroad or obtaining it from pharmacies that make drug compounds. \u201cYou have some legal exposure by doing so,\u201d said Dr. Morrison, a vein specialist in greater .\n\nThat said, polidocanol was the \u201csecond most commonly used sclerosing agent\u201d because, he said, \u201cmost physicians want to give their patients the best available treatment.\u201d\n\nF.D.A. approval of polidocanol should benefit patients several ways. Often the concentrations of polidocanol from compounding pharmacies were \u201cwrong\u201d and had \u201clots of contaminants\u201d that could damage the skin where injected, according to Dr. Robert A.

In these rare, worst-case scenarios, Asclera is relatively forgiving and less likely to lead to ulceration.\n\nVein specialists must first figure out which patients would benefit from sclerotherapy alone, and which need inner varicose veins treated before injections. Using to map inner veins as well as visible ones is crucial for patients who complain of enlarged veins and symptoms like achy pain. \u201cThe underlying veins have to be addressed before you can even think of addressing the visible bulging veins,\u201d said Dr. Robert J.

She is still due for treatments, so some veins remain visible, but they are no longer raised. She now wears sundresses instead of just selling them in her boardwalk shop.\n\nSome vein specialists use liquid irritants like STS or polidocanol to make an injectable foam that targets larger varicose veins.

Lomaira should be used together with regular exercise and a reduced-calorie diet.\n\nLomaira is the only strength of phentermine hydrochloride that can be taken up to three times a day before meals. The limited usefulness of agents of this drug class (anorectics), including Lomaira, should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use.\n\n\"At KVK Tech, we are committed to developing high-quality, FDA-approved medicines that address unmet medical needs, while ensuring affordable options for all appropriate patients. With Lomaira, we're giving physicians and patients access to a low-cost, low-dose version of a weight-reduction medicine, phentermine, that has been prescribed by physicians for over 50 years. Appropriate patients can take Lomaira up to three times a day, before meals \u2013 not just in the morning as with the higher dose formulations of phentermine,\" said Anthony Tabasso, President and Chief Executive Officer of KVK Tech. \"We developed Lomaira with this dosing flexibility and affordability in mind.\"\n\nPhentermine hydrochloride, an appetite suppressant, is the most commonly prescribed drug for weight loss. Over 7 million prescriptions are written for phentermine yearly by a wide range of healthcare professionals (HCPs), including obesity medicine specialists, family practitioners, endocrinologists, internists and cardiologists. 1\n\nPhentermine hydrochloride is typically prescribed in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg and taken before or within a few hours of breakfast. The usual adult dose of Lomaira is one tablet three times a day 1/2 hour before meals. The butterfly-shaped tablet is scored to facilitate administering one half of the usual dosage for patients not requiring the full dose, enabling doctors and patients to work together to customize a weight-loss treatment plan to best meet each patient's needs. Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. Phentermine is not recommended for use in pediatric patients 16 years of age or younger. Late evening medication should be avoided because of the possibility of resulting insomnia.\n\nLomaira is reasonably priced to ensure that cost does not create a hurdle, despite the fact that two-thirds of Americans pay out-of-pocket for their weight-loss prescription medications. Through KVK Tech's , eligible patients will pay no more than 50\u00a2 per tablet for the duration of treatment.\n\n\"Obesity is a chronic metabolic disease that must be managed appropriately to reduce the risk of serious health conditions. Many physicians have used phentermine to help patients as part of a comprehensive weight-management plan. Now, the flexibility in dosing with Lomaira allows doctors to personalize dosing. They can prescribe a lower dose, a good option for some patients. They can also prescribe up to three times a day, which is particularly helpful when patients struggle to control their appetite in the afternoon,\" said Donna Ryan, MD. \"Regrettably, many patients are still not covered by insurance for weight-loss medications and the low cost for Lomaira makes it an affordable treatment option.\"\n\nIn relatively short-term clinical trials, adults with obesity who were instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs (appetite suppressants) lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 2\n\n\"Even modest weight loss can dramatically improve risk and health,\" continued Dr. Ryan. \"It is not necessary to lose a lot of weight to get a lot of benefit.\" Losing five to 10 percent of total body weight is likely to produce health benefits, such as improvements in blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood sugars.3\n\nSome side effects of phentermine that have been reported include pulmonary hypertension, valvular heart disease, palpitations, increased heart rate or blood pressure, insomnia, restlessness, dry mouth, diarrhea, constipation and changes in sexual drive. These are not all of the potential side effects of phentermine. See Full Prescribing Information.\n\nLomaira is anticipated to be available by the end of September 2016. As with all KVK Tech products, Lomaira will be exclusively manufactured and packaged in the United States, in the strictest accordance with FDA, DEA, and DEP guidelines.\n\n*Body Mass Index (BMI) measures the amount of fat in the body based on height and weight.

Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), a rare fatal lung disease, has been reported in patients who had taken a combination of phentermine and fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible association between phentermine use alone and PPH cannot be ruled out. Patients should report immediately if they experience any decrease in the amount of exercise that they can normally tolerate, shortness of breath, chest or heart pain, fainting or swelling in the lower legs.\n\nSerious heart valve problems or disease have been reported in patients taking a combination of phentermine and fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine has not been established, therefore the possibility of an association between heart valve disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out.\n\nIf your body becomes adjusted to the maximum dose of phentermine so that its effects are experienced less strongly, the maximum dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect.\n\nCaution is advised while engaging in potentially hazardous activity such as driving or operating machinery while taking phentermine. Phentermine has the potential to be abused. Keep Lomaira in a safe place to prevent theft, accidental overdose, misuse or abuse. Using alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction.\n\nPhentermine can cause an increase in blood pressure. Tell your doctor if you have high blood pressure, even if it's mild. If you are taking medicines for type 2 diabetes, your doctor may have to adjust these medicines while taking phentermine.\n\nSome side effects of phentermine that have been reported include pulmonary hypertension, valvular heart disease, palpitations, increased heart rate or blood pressure, insomnia, restlessness, dry mouth, diarrhea, constipation and changes in sexual drive.

The results are presented in the journal The Lancet Oncology.\n\nRectal cancer affects some 2,000 men and women in Sweden every year. Preoperative radiotherapy was gradually introduced in the early 1990s, with a consequent improvement in prognosis for people with rectal cancer and reduction in the risk of local recurrence.\n\n\"Back then we showed that preoperative radiotherapy reduces the risk of local recurrence by over 50 per cent for patients with rectal cancer,\" says principal investigator Anna Martling, senior consultant surgeon and professor at Karolinska Institutet's Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery. \"Thanks to our results, radiotherapy is recommended to many rectal cancer patients.\"\n\nHowever, radiotherapy can cause adverse reactions and the optimal radiotherapeutic method and the interval between it and the ensuing surgery have been mooted.

The drug was then developed by Imperial, in collaboration with Emory University in the USA.\n\nEarly lab-based tests of ICEC0942 were successful in targeting resistant breast cancers and indicated minimal side effects. ICEC0942 was then licenced to Carrick Therapeutics, who developed it into a molecule named CT7001, which they have taken to early-stage clinical trials in less than two years.\n\nThe first patient was given the drug in November 2017 as part of Carrick's a Phase I clinical trial to assess its safety and how well it can be tolerated. The trial is still ongoing, so results are not available yet.\n\nProfessor Charles Coombes, from the Department of Surgery & Cancer, said: \"Treatment-resistant tumours represent a significant threat for patients, as once a cancer stops responding to treatments there is increasingly little clinicians can do.\n\n\"Drugs such as these could help to shift the balance back in favour of the patients, potentially providing a new option to patients for who existing treatments no longer work.\"\n\nProfessor Tony Barrett, from the Department of Chemistry, said: \"This work is the result of extensive collaboration between chemists, biologists and clinicians, which has helped to bring a new treatment from discovery to clinical testing in record time, streamlining the process.\"\n\nThe drug targets an enzyme called CDK7, involved in directing cells through their lifecycle, which consists of growth, DNA replication and cell division. CDK7 is also involved in the process of transcription, a vital step in gene expression - the creation of proteins to carry out cell functions. Particular cancers, such as treatment-resistant breast cancers, have a unique dependence on transcription, meaning targeting CDK7 may be particularly effective.\n\nBy inhibiting transcription, ICEC0942 shuts down the ability of the cancer to spread. As well as breast cancers, cancers such as acute myeloid leukaemia and small-cell lung cancer are particularly transcription-dependent, so ICEC0942 may work well for these too, especially where they have become resistant to other treatments.\n\nThe discovery of the drug was spurred by an initial meeting between Professor Anthony Barrett, from the Department of Chemistry, and oncologist Professor Charles Coombes from the Department of Surgery & Cancer.\n\nProfessor Simak Ali, also from the Department of Surgery & Cancer, was working on understanding the action of CDK7 in treatment-resistant breast cancer. Professors Coombes and Ali suggested CDK7 as a drug target, leading the collaboration to attempt to design a molecule that would inhibit its action.\n\nFrom early attempts, a large collaborative team was eventually founded for drug discovery from 'bench to bedside', directed by Dr Matthew Fuchter in the Department of Chemistry. Possible compounds for CDK7 inhibition were modelled using computational drug design, aided by collaboration with Emory University.\n\nUltimately, a candidate molecule called ICEC0942 suppressed tumour growth in a wide range of cancer types in lab tests. In addition, laboratory studies showed ICEC0942 worked better in combination with traditional hormone therapies for estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells, which have not yet become resistant. It is this molecule, in oral pill form, that was taken forward by Carrick as CT7001 and is currently in Phase I clinical trials. If the Phase I trial proves successful, the compound must pass further stages of trial over the next few years before it becomes available to patients.\n\nEarly funding for the study came from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), and a major contribution of whole-project funding was from Cancer Research UK. Licensing of the technology to Carrick Therapeutics was led by Cancer Research UK's Commercial Partnerships Team and Imperial Innovations, the Technology Transfer Office of Imperial, with support from Emory University.\n\nDr Iain Foulkes, Cancer Research UK's executive director of research and innovation, said: \"It's exciting to see how Cancer Research UK's partnerships with both academia and industry are bringing urgently needed new tests and treatments to patients.\n\n\"Drug resistance continues to be a major challenge across many cancer types so it's vital that we explore new ways to tackle tumours that have stopped responding to standard therapies.

Bipolar disorder often is misdiagnosed as major depression. But while the symptoms of the depressive phase of bipolar disorder are similar to that of major depression, the treatments are different and often challenging for the physician. In bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, a patient swings between an emotional high (manic episode) and severe depression. Treatment for the depressed phase includes an antidepressant along with a safeguard such as a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic drug to prevent a switch to a manic episode. A physician who misdiagnoses bipolar disorder as major depression could inadvertently trigger a manic episode by prescribing an antidepressant without a safeguard mood stabilizing drug. The study found that heart rate variability, as measured by an electrocardiogram, indicated whether subjects had major depression or bipolar disorder. (Heart rate variability is a variation in the time interval between heartbeats.) The study, by senior author Angelos Halaris, MD, PhD and colleagues, was published in the World Journal of Biological Psychiatry. \"Having a noninvasive, easy-to-use and affordable test to differentiate between major depression and bipolar disorder would be a major breakthrough in both psychiatric and primary care practices,\" Dr. Halaris said. Dr. Halaris said further research is needed to confirm the study\u2019s findings and determine their clinical significance. Dr. Halaris is a professor in Loyola's department of psychiatry and behavioral neurosciences and medical director of adult psychiatry. Major depression is among the most common and severe health problems in the world. In the United States, at least 8 to 10 percent of the population suffers from major depression at any given time. While less common than major depression, bipolar disorder is a significant mental health problem, affecting an estimated 50 million people worldwide. The Loyola study enrolled 64 adults with major depression and 37 adults with bipolar disorder. All subjects underwent electrocardiograms at the start of the study. Each participant rested comfortably on an exam table while a three-lead electrocardiogram was attached to the chest. After the patient rested for 15 minutes, the electrocardiographic data were collected for 15 minutes. Using a special software package, researchers converted the electrocardiographic data into the components of heart rate variability.

In measuring heart rate variability, researchers computed what is known to cardiologists as respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). At the baseline (beginning of the study), the subjects with major depression had significantly higher RSA than those with bipolar disorder. In a secondary finding, researchers found that patients with bipolar disorder had higher blood levels of inflammation biomarkers than patients with major depression. Inflammation occurs when the immune system revs up in response to a stressful condition such as bipolar disorder.

Breast cancer afflicts 1 in 8 women in their lifetime and 1 in 25 die from this disease. Although a number of randomized trials demonstrate the clear benefits of mammography screening in women up to age 74 on reducing mortality, data are sparse in women over the age of 74, especially minorities. In 2010, 41 percent of breast cancer deaths occurred in the more than 19 million women who are between the ages of 65 to 84 years.\n\nIn a new study published in the American Journal of Medicine, Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., senior author and first Sir Richard Doll Professor and senior academic advisor to the dean in the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine at Florida Atlantic University, indicates that black and white women ages 75 to 84 years who had an annual mammogram had lower 10-year breast cancer mortality than corresponding women who had biennial or no/irregular mammograms.\n\nAmong elder women, the American Cancer Society and the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommend regular mammography for ages 65 to 74.\n\nAlthough many guidelines rely on self-reports, Hennekens and his collaborators from Baylor College of Medicine and Meharry Medical College, used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program file linked to the Medicare administrative claims file, which allowed them to identify screening mammography use from 1995 to 2009 from 64,384 non-Hispanic women (4,886 black and 59,498 white). These linked files also permitted them to explore breast cancer mortality differences between elderly black or white women who self-selected for regular annual or biennial mammography screening. The researchers selected 69 as the lower age limit because Medicare coverage of the general population begins at age 65, and the exposure of interest was regular mammography screening in the four years immediately preceding breast cancer diagnosis.\n\nThree mutually exclusive categories were defined: no or irregular mammography; biennial mammography; and annual mammography. They looked at data from non-Hispanic, white or black women; Hispanics were not included because Hispanic white women have substantially lower mortality than non-Hispanic whites, and the number of Hispanic blacks is small. The researchers also measured socioeconomic status looking at median household income, the percentage of individuals living below the poverty level, and whether or not they had a high school education.\n\u2022 White women who had died tended to be older, to have a later stage diagnosis, to have received chemotherapy, and to have a higher socioeconomic status.\n\u2022 White women who died were less likely to have undergone surgery and receive radiation therapy.\n\u2022 Similar characteristics were seen in black women as in white women.\n\u2022 69- to 84-year-old women receiving regular annual screening mammography during the four years immediately preceding breast cancer diagnosis had consistently lower five-year and 10-year risks of breast cancer mortality than women with no or irregular screening regardless of race.\n\u2022 10-year risks were more than three times higher among white and more than two times higher among blacks aged 69 to 84 years with no or irregular screening compared with annual screening.\n\nHennekens notes that further research is needed, but that in the future, the use of regular claims-based surveillance for mammography as a source of data may offer some unique advantages over self-reports.\n\nFrom 1995 to 2005, according to Science Watch, Hennekens was the third most widely cited medical researcher in the world and five of the top 20 were his former fellows and/or trainees. In 2012, Science Heroes ranked Hennekens No. 81 in the history of the world for having saved more than 1.1 million lives, which placed him two ahead of professor Jonas Salk ranked No. 83 for the development of the polio vaccine.

All of the trials reviewed had \"major limitations,\" such as having too few patients, relying on parental reports of symptoms, or the study design (such as not being double-blinded).\n\n\"The notion that any form of complementary and alternative medicine is effective for infantile colic currently is not supported from the evidence from the included randomized clinical trials,\" the researchers from the United Kingdom wrote. \"Additional replications are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.\"\n\nBut because fennel extract, certain herbal teas and sugar water are generally safe, and because the research does suggest babies may benefit, pediatricians said they would feel comfortable recommending them to parents.\n\n\"It's reasonable for parents to consider those kinds of interventions for which there is some suggestion of benefit but no known risks,\" said Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York.\n\nThe study, published in the April print issue of Pediatrics, appears online March 28.\n\nColic usually starts when a baby is about three weeks old, said Dr. Ari Brown, a pediatrician in Austin, Texas, and author of the Expecting 411 book series. Colic is usually defined as excessive and inconsolable crying for at least three hours a day for more than three days a week over more than three weeks.\n\n\"It's miserable for both baby and the parents,\" Brown said. \"And although we've been studying it for years, no one has figured out what the cause is, which makes it all the more difficult to treat.\"\n\nIn the United States, between 5 and 19 percent of infants are estimated to have colic, according to background information in the article.\n\nBecause pediatricians can't offer parents much help with it -- for the most part, babies grow out of colic in time -- desperate parents often turn to alternative or complementary treatments, according to the study.\n\nIn the review, the study authors searched various databases of medical research and chose 15 randomized clinical trials involving alternative treatments for colic. The studies were published between 1991 and 2008, came from 10 different countries and included a total of 944 children.\n\nSeveral studies looked at spinal manipulation by a chiropractor. In three of those studies, parents reported their children cried significantly less afterwards. But those studies were small and flawed, so no conclusions can be made about the technique, according to the new review.\n\nThree studies looked at herbal supplements. One found improvement in infants given fennel extract compared to infants given a placebo; another found that infants given a tea containing chamomile, vervain, licorice, fennel and balm-mint seemed to work; while a third found infants given a tea containing fennel, lemon balm and chamomile cried less than infants given a placebo.\n\nFennel, an intestinal \"antispasmodic,\" may increase the speed at which food moves through the intestine, Brown said. This may help if the underlying cause of colic is cramping or discomfort due to an immature digestive tract, although that is just a theory, Brown added.\n\nTwo studies looked at giving babies solutions of sugar water, which some researchers believe has pain-killing properties. The parents of babies given sugar water reported significantly less crying. (If parents want to try it, they could deliver sugar water in a dropper, or put a small amount in a bottle, Adesman said.)\n\nA study of probiotics, which are reputed to help digestion, found that 95 percent of infants given L. reuteria probiotics seemed to reduce their average crying time compared to 7 percent of babies given simethicone, which is marketed to relieve gas under the brand names Mylicon and PediaCare Infants' Gas Relief.\n\n\"This is pertinent given that simethicone is considered the best available and most commonly prescribed treatment for colic, although it previously has been shown to be no more effective than the placebo,\" according to the authors.\n\nBrown said the strength of that finding suggests L. reuteria is worth further study.\n\nOne study found no difference in improvement of symptoms between infants whose parents were taught to do infant massage compared to infants put in a crib that vibrated. Nor did soy-enriched formula seem to help.\n\nA small study of babies given reflexology showed some improvement, but there was no difference in whether the reflexology targeted the feet, which are considered to be therapeutic for colic, or other parts of the body.\n\nThis implies the improvement may \"have more to do with the therapeutic effect of touch than the actual therapy itself,\" Dr. Edzard Ernst, of the department of complementary medicine at Peninsula Medical School, Universities of Exeter and Plymouth, in the United Kingdom, and colleagues wrote in the report.\n\nThe Nemours Foundation has more on colic.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story is about a review of several studies, and we don\u2019t expect the benefits to be quantified for each study reviewed.\u00a0Instead, the story used\u00a0vague phrases such as \u201cfound improvement.\u201d In on area, the story provides numbers, saying, \u201cA study of probiotics, which are reputed to help digestion, found that 95 percent of infants given L. reuteria probiotics seemed to reduce their average crying time compared to 7 percent of babies given simethicone, which is marketed to relieve gas under the brand names Mylicon and PediaCare Infants\u2019 Gas Relief.\u201d But even here, we would have liked to have seen some absolute numbers.

Currently, CT scans of the brain are the standard way of diagnosing TBI, but they can\u2019t pick up every case. And because the expose patients to radiation, doctors are often reluctant to use them on every patient, especially young children, who come to the emergency room with a head injury.\n\nBut in a study published in , scientists report on a promising blood test that could distinguish the more serious cases of TBI that require further evaluation. Led by Dr. Linda Papa, director of clinical research and an emergency physician at Orlando Regional Medical Center, the research team focused on two blood proteins that have already been linked to brain injury. Papa and her team expanded on that work by studying how levels of these two proteins, or biomarkers, change immediately after head trauma.\n\nThey collected blood from 584 people coming to the Orlando Regional Medical Center, which is a Level 1 Trauma Center, for trauma-related injuries. About half them had brain-related injuries, and half had other traumas, including broken bones and chest injuries. Papa wanted to test several things about the blood test, including whether they were specific to brain injuries or whether they changed during any trauma to any part of the body. All of the people had their blood drawn 19 times, starting at within four hours of their injury and up to 7 days later. By tracking changes in the levels of the two proteins over this time, Papa could see how they changed, and correlate that with the people\u2019s symptoms.\n\nMORE: Concussion Expert: Over 90% of NFL Players Have Brain Disease\n\nIn all people, regardless of the type of injury they had, the levels of the proteins, called GFAP and UCH-L1, rose within the first hour after the injuries. GFAP, which is specific to cells known as astrocytes that form a matrix for nerves in the central nervous system (which includes the brain and spinal cord), peak at 20 hours after the injury and then decline steadily but are still detectable seven days later. UCH-L1 is released by brain nerves when they\u2019re stressed, and its levels rise more rapidly immediately after injury and peak at eight hours.\n\nWhen Papa then looked just at people who showed signs of TBI on CT scans, she found that their levels of GFAP and UCH-L1 were significantly higher than those of people with other types of trauma, suggesting that the two markers can be relatively specific to TBI and not trauma in general.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to do any unnecessary procedures on people who don\u2019t need them,\u201d says Papa of using CT scans to distinguish people with more serious head injuries from those how just have hit their head but don\u2019t experience any symptoms. \u201cI don\u2019t think a blood will be the be-all and end-all but it would be a beautiful tool for us to have in the clinic to support a lot of our decision making.\u201d\n\nTesting for levels of UCH-L1, for example, might be helpful for emergency medical teams in an ambulance trying to assess whether a patient has any serious head injuries, since its levels peak in the hours immediately after a trauma. It might also help coaches or athletic trainers are sports events to determine which athletes who have had a concussion are able to return to the game and which, if they have higher levels of the blood marker, should not.\n\nMORE: A New Blood Test to Diagnose Concussions On The Field\n\nIn the emergency room, a blood test for UCH-L1 could also help doctors decide which patients should get a CT scan \u2014 the higher their levels of the protein are, the more likely they are to have TBI and would benefit from a scan, while those with lower levels probably don\u2019t need one.\n\nAnd because levels of GFAP tend to remain higher for many days, Papa says it might be useful in cases where patients don\u2019t come in immediately after a head injury, thinking they\u2019re okay, but see the doctor several days later because they\u2019re concerned. Even at that point, the study shows, GFAP levels might be higher than normal and therefore might indicate TBI and need for further tests.\n\n\u201cWe may not use these blood tests in a hundred percent of cases but probably in eighty percent of cases where there is a question mark, a blood test could definitely help,\u201d she says.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Readers should be informed of how many people with a concussion were accurately identified, and how many people without concussions were accurately ruled out.

Keeping skin healthy in the bright light of day is hard work. The devotion to hats and rash guards, the careful selection of sunscreen and thorough application and reapplication every 90 minutes is at best tedious, and when children are involved, the process can be truly demoralizing. But once the towels are hung on the line, in the soft light of dusk, your work is done. Right?\n\nA new school of thought in the beauty world is pushing the idea that what you put on your skin after a day at the beach could play a part in reducing sun damage. One proponent of the concept is Hillary Peterson, founder of Bay Area-based company True Nature Botanicals. Ms. Peterson, a former marketing executive, began to explore the use of all-natural products several years ago after surviving melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer.\n\nHer take on sun exposure is refreshingly pragmatic. \u201cThe message with\u2026protection has been to stay out of [the sun],\u201d said Ms. Peterson. \u201cBut I\u2019m on the phone with you from Hawaii and can see at least 40 people on the beach, soaking in the rays. My kids are outside playing. I know that it\u2019s not realistic to say \u2018no sun.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe is, however, quite knowledgeable about how to be safe when you\u2019re in the sun. (She\u2019s also called on Terrence Collins, the Teresa Heinz Professor of Green Chemistry at Carnegie Mellon University as a consultant to formulate her line.) Ms. Peterson has long been aware of the role that antioxidants play in protecting skin from UV damage. (A groundbreaking study in 1996 proved antioxidants like vitamins C and E can boost the efficacy of sunscreen and make skin more resistant to damage.) She even brews antioxidant-rich green tea, lets it cool and puts it in a spray bottle. \u201cI spritz my kids with it before I apply sunscreen and again after they come out of the sun,\u201d she said.\n\nNow, a new study by Yale University cancer researchers, published this year, shows that the cell-damaging effects of ultra-violet rays may continue for some time after you seek cover. Ergo, it may be necessary to draw out the day\u2019s protective ministrations into nighttime.\n\nThis information is in the early stages of transforming the category of after-sun care\u2014a category traditionally limited to aloe vera-laden moisturizers and gels that lowered the temperature of sun-parched skin but not much else. Product formulators are now seeing after-sun care as another line of defense to stop cell mutations and aging in its tracks.\n\nMs. Peterson recommends her Pacific Mist spray which contains antioxidant-rich green tea and white tea extracts as well as sea fennel extract, which aids in hydration, and the line\u2019s Pacific Face Oil which contains a mix of oils from chia seed, kiwi, passion fruit and papaya seed\u2014all rich in essential fatty acids and antioxidants.\n\nWhen shopping for other after-sun treatments, be aware that some labels only add a trace, ineffective amount of a beneficial ingredient to a product in order to tout its effects on the label, while others have a bona fide antioxidant slant.\n\nOne Love Organics, a 6-year-old company founded by ex-lawyer Suzanne LeRoux, is a fine example of the latter. Based in St. Simons Island, Ga., the brand has an Eco-Cert-certified lab that creates mostly organic, botanical-based face and body treatments developed with sun exposure in mind. Ms. LeRoux typically recommends layering the brand\u2019s Vitamin C Body Oil or the Gardenia + Tea Antioxidant Body Serum under sunscreen during the day. Rich with botanical oils and green tea extract, both are also ideal after-sun products. \u201cOur lab is on an island in the South. We think about sun exposure a lot,\u201d she added.\n\nAfter-sun care converts should also look for products dispensed in a pump or spray which keeps contents from oxidizing when exposed to air, like Blissoma\u2019s pomegranate extract-filled Amend Antioxidant Sprayable Lotion. Avoid products formulated with alcohol, which can dry skin out.\n\nNot everyone is convinced of the effectiveness of after-sun care. Beverly Hills-based dermatologist Rhonda Rand believes most products can only lower skin temperature and add moisture. \u201cThat can make sun-exposed skin feel better,\u201d she said, \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing you can do to reverse sun exposure.\u201d And while Henry Lim, president of the American Academy of Dermatology, believes that the Yale study was important, he cautions that you only have a three-hour window after sun exposure to take advantage of any potential product benefits\u2014and that antioxidants \u201care notoriously not very stable and must be formulated carefully in order to be effective.\u201d\n\nBut believers like True Nature Botanicals\u2019 Ms. Peterson are undeterred. \u201cIn medicine, you need a definitive study,\u201d she countered. \u201cWe can\u2019t get doctors to say if you eat a healthier diet, your body will function better.

The Food and Drug Administration approved Provenge this spring to treat advanced prostate cancer.\n\nBut now the study that led to FDA approval is finally out in this week's New England Journal of Medicine. And it's clear that experts are still scratching their heads about just how Provenge works.\n\nIt does work, sort of.\n\nIn the study, men with prostate cancer that no longer responds to hormone therapy (basically, chemical castration) lived about four months longer if they took Provenge than if they got placebo treatment. That's better than the only other approved treatment for such advanced cancers.\n\nBut, as the study's lead author Dr. Philip Kantoff acknowledges, \"It's not a home run; this is not going to cure prostate cancer.\"\n\nThe primary mystery is how Provenge extends life, since it doesn't shrink prostate tumors, as far as anyone can tell. \"Prolongation of survival without a measurable antitumor effect is surprising,\" writes Dr. Dan Longo of the National Institute on Aging in a NEJM editorial.\n\nDeep in the data is further mystery.\n\nProvenge is supposed to work by, in effect, vaccinating patients against their own cancers using a patient's own white blood cells.\n\nThe theory is that the custom-made vaccine incites patients' immune cells to attack the cancer. The study shows that patients who got Provenge were indeed more likely to mount immune-cell responses to a prostate cancer antigen in the test tube. But oddly, the patients who had these activated immune cells didn't survive any longer than those who didn't.\n\nThe other side of the immune system \u2013 the antibody arm -- showed a different picture. Patients who had a good antibody response to Provenge lived longer than those who didn't.\n\nNobody yet knows just how to explain these results. Longo, the NEJM editorialist, says he'd be more convinced if the placebo patients had received infusions of white blood cells that had been exposed just to the general immune-stimulating part of the Provenge treatment, without the prostate antigen part.\n\nThe way the study was done, he says, \"does not allow one to conclude\" that Provenge is working because it mobilizes the immune system specifically against prostate cancer.\n\nBut, after all, Provenge is just the first cancer immunotherapy on the market. So it's not surprising there's a lot to be learned, and that it's pretty pricey.\n\nOther immunotherapy approaches are in the pipeline, along with fancier versions of drugs to block the hormones that feed prostate cancer.\n\nMeanwhile, Dendreon, the Seattle-based company that makes Provenge, says there's a waiting list for the drug. The company estimates 100,000 American men have the kind of hormone-resistant, metastatic cancer the drug is approved to treat.

With this successful Phase 3 trial, insurers will now be more likely to pay for such off-label use.\n\nSome doctors criticized the organizers of the trial for testing Lucentis rather than another Genentech drug, Avastin, which works in the same way as Lucentis.\n\nAlthough it is a cancer drug, Avastin is often used off-label for eye diseases because it is far cheaper than Lucentis, costing only $20 to $100 a dose, compared with $2,000 for Lucentis.\n\nAvastin is undercutting sales of Lucentis, which totaled $1.1 billion in the United States last year.\n\nOrganizers of the trial conceded that a major reason Lucentis was chosen was that Genentech, which is now owned by Roche, agreed to provide the drug free of charge and to contribute $9 million in additional financing \u2014 but only if Lucentis were used.\n\n\u201cObviously you can\u2019t underplay $9 million,\u201d said Dr. Ferris of the eye institute, which is part of the part of the National Institutes of Health. But he said there were other factors as well, like a belief that Lucentis might have been the better drug.\n\nDr. Philip J. Rosenfeld, a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Miami, said the decision was \u201cclearly a case of pay to play\u201d since Genentech\u2019s money dictated the choice of drugs.\n\nRetinopathy results from damage to the blood vessels in the eye. In macular edema, fluid from those damaged vessels leaks into the macula, the part of the retina that is responsible for the straight-ahead vision important for driving, recognizing faces and reading.\n\nLucentis, also known as ranibizumab, works by drying up leaky blood vessels and preventing the growth of new ones.\n\nJohn Bevan, who has diabetic macular edema, said that every two months or so he used to have an incident in which blood leaked into his eye, blurring his vision.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a paintball hits a plate-glass window \u2014 there\u2019s a big splat and it drips downward and takes three days to a week to dissipate,\u201d said Mr. Bevan, the school superintendent in north central Indiana. He said treatment with Lucentis in the clinical trial virtually eliminated those incidents.\n\nThe trial involved 691 patients, some of whom had both eyes treated, resulting in 854 total eyes. There were four treatment groups: One group got Lucentis injections into the eye as often as every four weeks, plus laser therapy. Another got Lucentis, with laser therapy used only after six months and only if needed. The third group got laser therapy plus injections into the eye of triamcinolone, a steroid sold by Allergan under the name Trivaris. The fourth group got laser therapy plus a sham injection.\n\nAfter the first year, only 3 to 4 percent of the eyes treated with Lucentis suffered a visual loss of two or more lines compared to 13 percent that got only laser therapy.\n\nResearchers said the results seem to be holding up for the second year of the three-year trial.\n\nAbout 1 percent of those getting Lucentis injections suffered an inflammation of the eye from an infection.\n\nThe steroid treatment did not improve eyesight more than laser therapy alone and caused side effects.\n\nResults of the trial were published online on Tuesday by the journal Ophthalmology.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "\u00a0The story provided quantitative information about the possible impact on vision.

Researchers have found that delivering a fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) in a pill\u2014a poop pill, basically\u2014is no worse than a similar procedure done with a colonoscopy.\n\nNeither option may sound particularly enticing, but FMTs are wildly effective at treating a very nasty infection called Clostridium difficile. One of the first controlled clinical trials for FMTs in 2013 ended early because the patients who received the treatment were doing so much better than patients who didn\u2019t. In the new study, almost 90 percent of adults treated with the capsules were cured.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely insane. We just don\u2019t see kind of efficacy with drugs,\u201d Dr. Dina Kao told Newsweek. Kao is one of the authors of the paper and a gastroenterologist at the University of Alberta. Kao and her colleagues published the findings in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Tuesday.\n\nC. difficile infections can set in after a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which can wipe out some of the bacterial populations normally found in people\u2019s gut. The transplants work by replacing those \u201chealthy\u201d bacteria. \u201cC. difficile is the single biggest cause of diarrhea in a health care setting,\u201d Kao said. \u201cIt is our public enemy No. 1 in hospitals.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, C. difficile infects half a million people in the United States per year and kills 15,000 people. But patients may be hesitant to accept this potentially life-saving treatment because there are feces involved. Previous research found that while every part of this treatment was unappealing to most people, being offered the treatment in a pill form made patients significantly more open to the idea. Other efforts to take the \u201cpoop\u201d out of the poop pills\u2014to just include the bacteria thought to be behind the benefits\u2014have failed.\n\nThe 116 patients used in this study may have been selected in part because they were ideal candidates for FMTs, Dr. Elizabeth Hohmann noted, but she said the paper is solid overall. (Hohmann, a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital who has also done research on FMTs, was not involved in his research.) \u201cThe results are sort of a best-case scenario,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I like about this paper is that it validates the upper-GI route and demonstrates that you can get very good cure rates without doing a colonoscopy.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s important because colonoscopies and the anesthesia required for the procedure can put a lot of stress on a person\u2019s body and can be complicated for the people most at risk for C. difficile infections, Hohmann noted\n\nKao\u2019s study also showed that people found FMTs far less unpleasant when the poop came in a pill. Two-thirds of the 57 patients who got the pills said their experiences were \u201cnot at all unpleasant,\u201d while just 44 percent of the 59 patients who received the FMT via a colonoscopy could say the same.\n\nBut most importantly, the study found no difference in effectiveness between the two therapies. There was a significant difference in cost. Though the procedures were done in a Canadian hospital, the FMTs delivered by colonoscopy cost nearly $500 USD more than the capsules, which cost about $300.\n\nFMTs are not yet common practice, though Kao noted that it is becoming the standard of care for C. difficile infections. \u201cFor this group of patients, nothing else really works,\u201d she said. However, the same cannot be said yet for other conditions. While the FDA said in 2013 that doctors can try fecal transplants in patients with C. difficile infections, the agency noted doctors should only use FMT for other conditions in clinical trials. Over 100 clinical trials are ongoing for various FMT therapies, including ones to treat ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease in children. (New FDA guidelines have been in the works since 2016 but aren\u2019t finalized.)\n\nDespite the FDA\u2019s advice, some people have set up shop as FMT providers anyway. Buzzfeed reported in June that one clinic in Tampa was even providing FMTs as a treatment for autism.\n\nThough physicians think they know how FMTs work, it remains somewhat mysterious. One recent, small study found that even stool samples that are entirely free of bacteria can be effective, perhaps because there are non-bacterial organisms that also help.\n\n\u201cWe still don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on, and in these other conditions it\u2019s not as clear-cut that the disturbance in the bacterial composition is the cause,\u201d Kao said. \u201cStool is such a complex mixture.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "This was a close call.

Ten years ago, scientists started looking at the hormones made in the pituitary gland to see how they act on certain targets. They found some of these hormones had an effect on bone mass.\n\nFrom this, they created an antibody to see if it could be used to prevent bone loss in mice\u2014and in 2010, they showed it could.

Whilst healthy cells use mitochondria to generate energy, cancer cells contain defective mitochondria which are incapable of sustaining the cell\u2019s energy requirements.\n\nIn the absence of FY26, cancer cells switch from using their defective mitochondria to using metabolic activity in their cytoplasm to generate energy.

We have been building a body of evidence over the past six years to show that singing in a choir can have a range of social, emotional and psychological benefits, and now we can see it has biological effects too.\n\n\"We've long heard anecdotal evidence that singing in a choir makes people feel good, but this is the first time it's been demonstrated that the immune system can be affected by singing. It's really exciting and could enhance the way we support people with cancer in the future.\"\n\nThe study also found that those with the lowest levels of mental wellbeing and highest levels of depression experienced greatest mood improvement, associated with lower levels of inflammation in the body. There is a link between high levels of inflammation and serious illness.\n\nChoir members gave samples of their saliva before an hour of singing, and then again just after. The samples were analysed to see what changes occurred in a number of hormones, immune proteins, neuropeptides and receptors.\n\nDr Daisy Fancourt, Research Associate at the Centre for Performance Science, a partnership between the Royal College of Music and Imperial College London and co-author of the research, said: \"Many people affected by cancer can experience psychological difficulties such as stress, anxiety and depression. Research has demonstrated that these can suppress immune activity, at a time when patients need as much support as they can get from their immune system. This research is exciting as it suggests that an activity as simple as singing could reduce some of this stress-induced suppression, helping to improve wellbeing and quality of life amongst patients and put them in the best position to receive treatment.\"\n\nDiane Raybould, 64, took part in the study and has been singing with the Bridgend Sing with Us choir since 2010. Diane was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was aged 50. Her daughter was diagnosed with breast cancer at the same time and sadly, passed away from the disease at just 28. Diane said: \"Singing in the choir is about more than just enjoyment, it genuinely makes you feel better. The choir leaders play a huge part of course, but so does the support of the other choir members, the inspirational programme and uplifting songs. The choir is a family, simple as that. Having cancer and losing someone to cancer can be very isolating. With the choir, you can share experiences openly and that is hugely important.\"\n\nRosie Dow, Head of Sing with Us at Tenovus Cancer Care and co-author of the research, added: \"This research is so exciting, as it echoes everything all our choir members tell us about how singing has helped them. I've seen peoples' lives transformed through singing in our choirs so knowing that singing also makes a biological difference will hopefully help us to reach more people with the message that singing is great for you - mind, body and soul.\"\n\nFollowing on from this research, Tenovus Cancer Care is launching a two year study looking in more depth at the longitudinal effect of choir singing over several months. It will look at mental health, wellbeing, social support and ability to cope with cancer, alongside measuring stress hormones and immune function amongst patients, carers, staff and people who have lost somebody to cancer.\n\nThe full research paper can be found at http://ecancer.\n\nIf you or someone you love has been affected by cancer, Tenovus Cancer Care can offer help and support.

That includes more than three million Americans, only half of whom are aware they have the disease, according to the Glaucoma Research Foundation.\n\nCoffee, or caffeine in general have previously been linked to increased glaucoma risk, although recent studies don\u2019t agree, Coleman and her colleagues write.\n\nTo evaluate the relationship between specific caffeinated drinks and glaucoma, Coleman and colleagues analyzed data on a sample of more than 10,000 people in the U.S. who were representative of the entire population. Participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey during 2005-2006 answered questions about their diets and lifestyles, had medical exams and blood tests and also underwent eye examinations.\n\nAbout 1,700 participants were over age 40, had no other known eye diseases and had full eye examination results from the survey. In this group, Coleman\u2019s team found that just over 5 percent, 82 people, had glaucoma.\n\nAlmost half of participants reported drinking coffee often, but less than 10 percent drank hot tea daily. The research team found no associations between coffee, iced tea, decaffeinated tea or soft drink consumption and the likelihood of having glaucoma.\n\n\u201cTea drinkers should keep drinking and don\u2019t need to stop because of a fear of glaucoma,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cThis makes sense, but we\u2019ll see if it holds up in future studies.\u201d\n\nFuture studies should look at the habits, activities and nutrition that affect lifestyle and glaucoma risks, said Idan Hecht of Tel-Aviv University in Israel, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research.\n\n\u201cIn the past few years, there has been a tremendous increase in interest, and subsequently research, into the ways lifestyle changes can influence diseases,\u201d Hecht told Reuters Health by email.\n\nRecent research indicates that vitamins C, E and zinc can help vision.

Repatha binds to PCSK9 and inhibits circulating PCSK9 from binding to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR), preventing PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation and permitting LDLR to recycle back to the liver cell surface. By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, Repatha increases the number of LDLRs available to clear LDL from the blood, thereby lowering LDL-C levels.6\n\nRepatha is approved in more than 40 countries, including the U.S., Japan, Canada and in all 28 countries that are members of the European Union. Applications in other countries are pending.\n\nImportant U.S. Product Information\n\nRepatha\u00ae is indicated as an adjunct to diet and:\n\u2022 Maximally tolerated statin therapy for treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), who require additional lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)\n\u2022 Other LDL-lowering therapies (e.g., statins, ezetimibe, LDL apheresis) in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) who require additional lowering of LDL-C\n\nThe effect of Repatha\u00ae on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.\n\nThe safety and effectiveness of Repatha\u00ae have not been established in pediatric patients with HoFH who are younger than 13 years old.\n\nThe safety and effectiveness of Repatha\u00ae have not been established in pediatric patients with primary hyperlipidemia or HeFH.\n\nContraindication: Repatha\u00ae is contraindicated in patients with a history of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to Repatha\u00ae.\n\nAllergic reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. rash, urticaria) have been reported in patients treated with Repatha\u00ae, including some that led to discontinuation of therapy. If signs or symptoms of serious allergic reactions occur, discontinue treatment with Repatha\u00ae, treat according to the standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve.\n\nAdverse reactions: The most common adverse reactions (>5% of Repatha\u00ae-treated patients and more common than placebo) were: nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, influenza, back pain, and injection site reactions.\n\nIn a 52-week trial, adverse reactions led to discontinuation of treatment in 2.2% of Repatha\u00ae-treated patients and 1% of placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction that led to Repatha\u00ae treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo was myalgia (0.3% versus 0% for Repatha\u00ae and placebo, respectively).\n\nAdverse reactions from a pool of the 52-week trial and seven 12-week trials:\n\nLocal injection site reactions occurred in 3.2% and 3.0% of Repatha\u00ae -treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most common injection site reactions were erythema, pain, and bruising. The proportions of patients who discontinued treatment due to local injection site reactions in Repatha\u00ae -treated patients and placebo-treated patients were 0.1% and 0%, respectively.\n\nAllergic reactions occurred in 5.1% and 4.7% of Repatha\u00ae -treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most common allergic reactions were rash (1.0% versus 0.5% for Repatha\u00ae and placebo, respectively), eczema (0.4% versus 0.2%), erythema (0.4% versus 0.2%), and urticaria (0.4% versus 0.1%).\n\nNeurocognitive events were reported in less than or equal to 0.2% in Repatha\u00ae-treated and placebo-treated patients.\n\nIn a pool of placebo- and active-controlled trials, as well as open-label extension studies that followed them, a total of 1,988 patients treated with Repatha\u00ae had at least one LDL-C value <25 mg/dL. Changes to background lipid-altering therapy were not made in response to low LDL-C values, and Repatha\u00ae dosing was not modified or interrupted on this basis. Although adverse consequences of very low LDL-C were not identified in these trials, the long-term effects of very low levels of LDL-C induced by Repatha\u00ae are unknown.\n\nMusculoskeletal adverse reactions were reported in 14.3% of Repatha\u00ae -treated patients and 12.8% of placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions that occurred at a rate greater than placebo were back pain (3.2% versus 2.9% for Repatha\u00ae and placebo, respectively), arthralgia (2.3% versus 2.2%), and myalgia (2.0% versus 1.8%).\n\nHomozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH): In 49 patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia studied in a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 33 patients received 420 mg of\n\nRepatha\u00ae subcutaneously once monthly. The adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2 (6.1%) Repatha\u00ae-treated patients and more frequently than in placebo-treated patients, included upper respiratory tract infection (9.1% versus 6.3%), influenza (9.1% versus 0%), gastroenteritis (6.1% versus 0%), and nasopharyngitis (6.1% versus 0%).\n\nImmunogenicity: Repatha\u00ae is a human monoclonal antibody. As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with Repatha\u00ae.\n\nPlease contact Amgen Medinfo at 800-77-AMGEN (800-772-6436) or 844-REPATHA (844-737-2842) regarding Repatha\u00ae availability or find more information, including full Prescribing Information, at www.amgen.com and www.Repatha.com.\n\nAbout Amgen Cardiovascular\n\nBuilding on more than three decades of experience in developing biotechnology medicines for patients with serious illnesses, Amgen is dedicated to addressing important scientific questions to advance care and improve the lives of patients with cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.1 Amgen's research into cardiovascular disease, and potential treatment options, is part of a growing competency at Amgen that utilizes human genetics to identify and validate certain drug targets.

Forty-six of the infants had an older sibling with an autism spectrum disorder, while the other 33 had no family history of autism.\n\nChildren who have a sibling with autism are much more likely to develop autism themselves, explained lead study author William Bosl, a neuroinformatics researcher at Children's Hospital Boston. Prior research has shown that about 20 percent of siblings of children with autism will also develop autism and another 40 to 50 percent will have some characteristics of the disorder, such as repetitive behaviors or problems with social interaction, language or communication, but not the full-blown disorder.\n\nWhile the children watched people blowing bubbles, researchers measured the babies' brain waves and analyzed the results using computer algorithms. The algorithms can detect subtle patterns in the lines created by EEGs that the human eye might miss, Bosl explained.\n\nWhen the babies were nine months old, researchers could predict who was in the high-risk autism group -- that is, they had a sibling with autism -- with nearly 80 percent accuracy.\n\n\"In this study, we have taken the first step in showing that there is definitive information in the electrical signals measured by EEG to distinguish normal controls from infants at high risk for developing autism,\" Bosl said.\n\nWhen broken out by gender, researchers found other differences. For example, at nine months they were able to predict which boys were in the high-risk group with near 100 percent accuracy. But accuracy for girls at that age was only 60 percent, not statistically significant.\n\nAt six months of age, however, they could predict the high risk girls with about 80 percent accuracy, though they couldn't do the same for boys that young.\n\n\"It seems perhaps they are on a slightly different developmental trajectory,\" Bosl said.\n\nThe study is published online Feb. 22 in BMC Medicine.\n\nEEGs measure brain electrical activity through electrodes attached to the scalp. The technology has been around for awhile -- developed in the late 1920s, it has been used for more than 60 years to detect seizures in epileptics.\n\nBut it's the newer, artificial intelligence technology and sophisticated computer algorithms that enabled the researchers to look more deeply into what the EEGs show, Bosl said.\n\n\"Artificial intelligence gives us the ability to find patterns we might not find with our own eyes,\" Bosl said. \"One of the difficulties with a disorder like autism is that it's very heterogenous. A very high-functioning person with autism might not be so different from a so-called 'normal' person who is quirky. Defining the differences may be somewhat subtle.\"\n\nEEGs are also relatively inexpensive, painless and safe, Bosl said. And unlike MRIs, they require no sedation, so testing could be put to widespread use, he said.\n\n\"My hope is we would have a simple way of measuring brain activity in every child and see the patterns emerging that might track autism characteristics,\" Bosl said. \"That would be tremendously useful. We know early intervention is extremely important. Right now, for a lot of children, that means 3 years old. What we don't know yet is if you can intervene at 9 or 12 months and how effective that could be.\"\n\nDr. Joshua Ewen, a neurologist and director of the clinical neurophysiology laboratory at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, said the study is well done and looks promising, but needs to be replicated.\n\nAlso, the study predicted who was at high risk of autism, but it's unknown if those babies actually went on to develop autism, he noted.\n\n\"If it can eventually be shown that this technique can reliably identify which children will indeed develop autism, then we will have a valuable tool for early detection,\" Ewen said. \"Early detection continues to be of critical importance, as it opens the door to early intervention, which has been shown to improve outcomes for children with autism.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more on autism.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story provides a lot of percentages but very little in terms of absolute differences or clear, hard numbers.

It concluded that these other groups perform about as well as 12-step programs.\n\n\u201cThis study suggests that these alternatives really are viable options for people who are looking for recovery support and don\u2019t like AA for whatever reason,\u201d Sarah Zemore, lead author of the study, told me.\n\nThe research is by no means the last word on this question \u2014 Zemore characterized the study as the beginning of a deeper evaluation into AA alternatives.\n\nBut this is important. There has been a good amount of research into AA and the 12 steps over the years, broadly finding that about a third of people maintain recovery from alcohol addiction due to 12-step treatment, another third get something out of the treatment but not enough for full recovery, and another third get nothing at all.\n\nResearchers have long suspected, though, that the benefits found in 12-step treatment programs are not exclusive to the 12 steps. As Zemore told me, \u201cThe benefits of 12-step groups are not driven by the 12 steps\u2019 specific philosophy or adherence to the 12 steps. It\u2019s really more about general mechanisms like abstinence motivation and social support for abstinence. Presumably, you could get those by participating in alternatives to AA.\u201d\n\nIn other words, these alternatives could help the one-third to two-thirds of people who don\u2019t get anything or much out of AA. That would help deal with a big public health issue: Based on federal data, more than 20 million people in the US have a substance use disorder, and within that group, more than 15 million have an alcohol use disorder. Excessive drinking alone is linked to 88,000 deaths each year. So finding the right solutions for this problem is literally a matter of life or death.\n\nThe study, conducted by the Alcohol Research Group at the Public Health Institute in California and published last month in the Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment, surveyed more than 600 people with alcohol use disorder (AUD), who were divided by which mutual help group they primarily participated in. Researchers followed up at six months then 12 months, measuring involvement in the groups and various substance use outcomes, including abstinence from drinking and alcohol-related problems.\n\nAfter controlling for several factors, the researchers concluded that \u201c[Women for Sobriety], LifeRing, and SMART are as effective as 12-step groups for those with AUDs.\u201d\n\n\u201cEssentially, that\u2019s the story,\u201d Zemore said. \u201cWe were really interested in whether the effects of involvement on recovery outcomes depended on which group [participants] were in. And we found that they did not.\u201d\n\nThere were some differences in the data. People who reported SMART as their primary group seemed to have worse substance use outcomes, and there were lower odds of total abstinence among LifeRing members.\n\nThat might have something to do with differences in recovery goals. For example, AA really emphasizes total abstinence from drinking as the solution to alcohol addiction. Groups like SMART and LifeRing, meanwhile, can be friendlier to the idea of members moderating their drinking but not quitting altogether. That could affect substance use outcomes \u2014 and especially abstinence outcomes.\n\nThe study\u2019s survey data suggests this is in fact what was going on: When researchers controlled for people\u2019s recovery goals \u2014 meaning, whether they wanted to commit to lifetime total abstinence or not \u2014 the differences between the 12-step groups, SMART, and LifeRing went away.\n\n\u201cThat suggests that people with less commitment to lifetime total abstinence are more likely to participate in SMART and LifeRing than they are to participate in 12-step groups,\u201d Zemore said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing these associations between SMART and LifeRing affiliation at baseline and worse recovery outcomes when you control for involvement.\u201d She added, \u201cBut I want to emphasize that these go away when you control for recovery goals.\u201d\n\nAgain, the study is not the final word. John Kelly, an addiction researcher at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the study, told me that the study is \u201cgood news, in general,\u201d but pointed out that it\u2019s limited by its methodology: It\u2019s based on an online survey, not the kind of randomized trial that\u2019s typically the gold standard in research. That may have led to some potentially biased results \u2014 perhaps participants in specific groups were less likely to report bad outcomes, for instance.\n\nAnd since it\u2019s only one study, it\u2019s possible that the results were biased in some other way. So it\u2019s up to future research to verify the findings.\n\nOne tricky thing with this line of research is you can\u2019t really force people to participate in certain groups \u2014 so studies that randomly assign participants to AA, SMART, LifeRing, or Women for Sobriety may not be easy to do. But there are ways that researchers could get around these problems, such as only using participants who are willing to try different groups and actively following up with them to make sure they are actually participating.\n\nAnother big research question: figuring out why, exactly, these groups might work to help people stay alcohol- or drug-free. There\u2019s good research into how AA works, but it\u2019d be good to figure out if SMART, LifeRing, and Women for Sobriety work in a similar way. That, Zemore said, will be one of her goals in future studies.\n\nWhy we need alternatives\n\nIn discussions about addiction treatment, AA and the 12 steps tend to prompt polarizing reactions \u2014 some people swear by the programs, others absolutely hate them.\n\nThere\u2019s a good explanation for that: While the research shows that 12-step treatment can be as effective as professional treatment modalities like cognitive behavioral therapy, the research also shows that the 12 steps don\u2019t work for everyone.\n\nAs one example, a prominent complaint about 12-step programs is the spiritual aspect. This is a big part of the 12 steps, with the final step even invoking \u201ca spiritual awakening.\u201d For people who aren\u2019t religious or spiritual, this can be a big turn-off; that\u2019s one reason SMART and LifeRing exist to begin with \u2014 they\u2019re meant to be secular alternatives to the 12 steps.\n\nThe good news is that the research suggests the spiritual aspect doesn\u2019t fully explain why the 12 steps are effective for some people. Instead, it seems other traits are just as, if not more, important \u2014 such as the social support that AA meetings provide and the lessons that participants can pick up at meetings.\n\nThat\u2019s long led researchers to suspect that alternative mutual help groups could work. If so, that would let some people go to AA meetings if they prefer the 12 steps, while others could find SMART, LifeRing, Women for Sobriety, or something else that works for them. Basically, everyone could find a workable solution.\n\nProviding these alternatives would essentially move addiction treatment closer to other kinds of medical problems. As Keith Humphreys, a drug policy expert at Stanford University, previously told me, \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything that works for everybody. There\u2019s very few places in medicine where you do.\u201d So there need to be as many alternatives as possible.\n\nThe US is far from that at the moment. Most treatment facilities in America are, according to the survey data and research, at least partly based on the 12 steps \u2014 making it the only option for many people. While alternatives like SMART or LifeRing do exist, they\u2019re not nearly as available as AA \u2014 and they certainly aren\u2019t built into professional treatment programs in the same way as the 12 steps.\n\nAs Albert, a pseudonym for an AA member in Georgia, previously told me, \u201cThere\u2019s just not a lot of widely advertised options available.\u201d AA and 12-step treatment are \u201cthe most well-known and most recommended option, so that\u2019s kind of where you tend to go.\u201d\n\nZemore\u2019s study begins to peel away at this problem. By showing that there really might be other effective options out there, the research provides hope that there may be a better \u2014 or at least more complete \u2014 solution out there for alcohol addiction.\n\nFor more on the research into AA and the 12 steps, read Vox\u2019s explainer.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story reports the researchers\u2019 conclusion that\u00a0\u201c[Women for Sobriety], LifeRing, and SMART are as effective as 12-step groups for those with AUDs.\u201d\nThe story also quantifies that level of effectiveness when it says that studies broadly find that \u201cabout a third of people maintain recovery from alcohol addiction due to 12-step treatment, another third get something out of the treatment but not enough for full recovery, and another third get nothing at all.\u201d\nThe story acknowledges that there were some differences in the data \u2014 for example that those who reported SMART as their primary group \u201cseemed to have worse substance use outcomes,\u201d and that \u201cthere were lower odds of total abstinence among LifeRing members.\u201d It explains that those differences might be explained by the differing goals of the programs, as LifeRing doesn\u2019t emphasize complete abstinence as intensely as the 12-step programs.

This is the first product in its class (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors) approved to treat this type of cancer.\n\n\"Tecentriq provides these patients with a new therapy targeting the PD-L1 pathway,\" said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \"Products that block PD-1/PD-L1 interactions are part of an evolving story about the relationship between the body's immune system and its interaction with cancer cells.\"\n\nTecentriq targets the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway (proteins found on the body's immune cells and some cancer cells). By blocking these interactions, Tecentriq may help the body's immune system fight cancer cells. Tecentriq is the first FDA-approved PD-L1 inhibitor and the latest in the broader class of PD-1/PD-L1 targeted biologics approved by the FDA in the last two years.\n\nTecentriq is approved for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma whose disease has worsened during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or within 12 months of receiving platinum-containing chemotherapy, either before (neoadjuvant) or after (adjuvant) surgical treatment. Urothelial carcinoma is the most common type of bladder cancer and occurs in the urinary tract system, involving the bladder and related organs. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) estimates 76,960 new cases of bladder cancer and 16,390 deaths from the disease in 2016.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Tecentriq were studied in a single-arm clinical trial involving 310 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. This trial measured the percentage of patients who experienced complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors (objective response rate). The study also looked at the difference in effect based on \"positive\" versus \"negative\" expression of the PD-L1 protein on patients' tumor-infiltrating immune cells. In all patients, 14.8 percent of participants experienced at least a partial shrinkage of their tumors, an effect that lasted from more than 2.1 to more than 13.8 months at the time of the response analysis. In patients who were classified as \"positive\" for PD-L1 expression, 26 percent of participants experienced a tumor response (compared to 9.5 percent of participants who were classified as \"negative\" for PD-L1 expression).\n\nWhile patients who received Tecentriq experienced a tumor response across the study, the greater effect in those who were classified as \"positive\" for PD-L1 expression suggests that the level of PD-L1 expression in tumor-infiltrating immune cells may help identify patients who are more likely to respond to treatment with Tecentriq. Therefore, today the FDA also approved the Ventana PD-L1 (SP142) assay to detect PD-L1 protein expression levels on patients' tumor-infiltrating immune cells and help physicians determine which patients may benefit most from treatment with Tecentriq.\n\nThe most common side effects of treatment with Tencentriq were fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, urinary tract infection, fever (pyrexia) and constipation. Tencentriq also has the potential to cause infection and serious side effects that result from the immune system effect of Tencentriq (known as \"immune-mediated side effects\"). These severe immune-mediated side effects involve healthy organs, including the lung, colon and endocrine system.\n\nThe FDA granted the Tecentriq application breakthrough therapy designation, priority review status and accelerated approval for this indication. These are distinct programs intended to facilitate and expedite the development and review of certain new drugs in light of their potential to benefit patients with serious or life-threatening conditions.\n\nTecentriq is marketed by Genentech based in San Francisco, California.

According to a study published in Nature today, researchers discovered that these drugs may activate stem cells in the brain to stimulate myelin producing cells and repair white matter, which is damaged in multiple sclerosis. The study was partially funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), part of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nSpecialized cells called oligodendrocytes lay down multiple layers of a fatty white substance known as myelin around axons, the long \u201cwires\u201d that connect brain cells. Myelin acts as an insulator and enables fast communication between brain cells. In multiple sclerosis there is breakdown of myelin and this deterioration leads to muscle weakness, numbness and problems with vision, coordination and balance.\n\n\u201cTo replace damaged cells, the scientific field has focused on direct transplantation of stem cell-derived tissues for regenerative medicine, and that approach is likely to provide enormous benefit down the road. We asked if we could find a faster and less invasive approach by using drugs to activate native nervous system stem cells and direct them to form new myelin. Our ultimate goal was to enhance the body\u2019s ability to repair itself,\u201d said Paul J. Tesar, Ph.D., associate professor at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine in Cleveland, and senior author of the study.\n\nIt is unknown how myelin-producing cells are damaged, but research suggests they may be targeted by malfunctioning immune cells and that multiple sclerosis may start as an autoimmune disorder. Current therapies for multiple sclerosis include anti-inflammatory drugs, which help prevent the episodic relapses common in multiple sclerosis, but are less effective at preventing long-term disability. Scientists believe that therapies that promote myelin repair might improve neurologic disability in people with multiple sclerosis.\n\nAdult brains contain oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), which are stem cells that generate myelin-producing cells. OPCs are found to multiply in the brains of multiple sclerosis patients as if to respond to myelin damage, but for unknown reasons they are not effective in restoring white matter. In the current study, Dr. Tesar wanted to see if drugs already approved for other uses were able to stimulate OPCs to increase myelination.\n\nOPCs have been difficult to isolate and study, but Dr. Tesar and his colleagues, in collaboration with Robert Miller, Ph.D., professor at George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C., developed a novel method to investigate these cells in a petri dish. Using this technique, they were able to quickly test the effects of hundreds of drugs on the stem cells.\n\nThe compounds screened in this study were obtained from a drug library maintained by NIH\u2019s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS). All are approved for use in humans. NCATS and Dr. Tesar have an ongoing collaboration and plan to expand the library of drugs screened against OPCs in the near future to identify other promising compounds.\n\nDr. Tesar\u2019s team found that two compounds in particular, miconazole (an antifungal) and clobetasol (a steroid), stimulated mouse and human OPCs into generating myelin-producing cells.\n\nNext, they examined whether the drugs, when injected into a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, could improve re-myelination. They found that both drugs were effective in activating OPCs to enhance myelination and reverse paralysis. As a result, almost all of the animals regained the use of their hind limbs. They also found that the drugs acted through two very different molecular mechanisms.\n\n\u201cThe ability to activate white matter cells in the brain, as shown in this study, opens up an exciting new avenue of therapy development for myelin disorders such as multiple sclerosis,\u201d said Ursula Utz, Ph.D., program director at the NINDS.\n\nDr. Tesar and his colleagues caution that more research is needed before miconazole and clobetasol can be tested in multiple sclerosis clinical trials. They are currently approved for use as creams or powders on the surfaces of the body but their safety administered in other forms, such as injections, in humans is unknown.\n\n\u201cOff-label use of the current forms of these drugs is more likely to increase other health concerns than alleviate multiple sclerosis symptoms. We are working tirelessly to ready a safe and effective drug for clinical use,\u201d Dr. Tesar said.\n\nThis work was supported by the NINDS (NS085246, NS030800, NS026543), the New York Stem Cell Foundation and the Myelin Repair Foundation, New York City.\n\nThe NINDS is the nation\u2019s leading funder of research on the brain and nervous system.

The hope is that the devices, now being tested in clinical trials, will save lives, reduce medical expenses and nudge heart patients toward managing their symptoms much the way people with diabetes manage theirs. Patients, who often are frail or live far from their doctors, can be spared frequent office visits. Doctors can learn immediately if devices are malfunctioning or if patients\u2019 hearts are starting to fail.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like having an office visit every day and a complete physical every week,\u201d said Dr. Leslie Saxon, a cardiologist at the University of Southern California.\n\nThe big leap forward came a few years ago when device companies figured out how to make transmitters that send data over a broader range, 20 or 30 feet. That meant that, with her device, Mrs. Elzo did not have to wait till her doctor could put a receiver directly on her chest. Instead, she simply went near a small box, which is attached to a phone jack near her bed. Once a week, she also measures her weight and blood pressure \u2014 key indicators of heart failure \u2014 and that information is automatically transmitted to her doctor. If there are problems, the machine alerts her doctor.\n\n\u201cNow, every single day the device is being queried,\u201d said her doctor, James Coman of the Heart Rhythm Institute in Tulsa. \u201cIt\u2019s just a phenomenal tool.\u201d\n\nThere is a downside, though: \u201cInformation overload is a very serious problem\u201d for the doctors, said Dr. Lynne Warner Stevenson, director of the Heart Failure Program at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston and a professor at Harvard Medical School, who counts herself as a proponent of smart devices. More information, she warned, is not always beneficial.\n\nThe devices transmit useful data along with data whose significance is not clear, like variations in heart rate. Large swings in heart rate can indicate risk, but it is not clear what to do about them.\n\nEven more confusing are changes in thoracic impedance, a measurement of resistance to electric current through the lung. Impedance changes can predict future heart crises, but more often have no clinical explanation. Yet when doctors get data on impedance changes, they often feel uneasy and call patients to see how they are, making patients uneasy in turn, Dr. Stevenson said.\n\nDr. Stevenson likened such information to the game of \u201cJeopardy!\u201d \u2014 doctors are given answers in search of a question. It\u2019s a challenge even for the nation\u2019s 1,000 heart failure specialists. But it can be even harder for primary care doctors, who have less expertise in heart failure yet care for most of the six million patients in the country with the condition.\n\nDr. Richard Page, president of the Heart Rhythm Society, said doctors wonder if they can be held liable if they do not look at all the data. Still, he said, the new technology \u201cis potentially transformative.\u201d\n\nFor researchers the information deluge leads to a different problem: how to analyze the data. A large clinical trial of a cardiac device used to involve 1,000, maybe 2,000 patients. Now, Boston Scientific, a maker of one of the smart heart devices, is following 400,000 patients.\n\n\u201cNo one has ever done research like this before,\u201d said Dr. Saxon, who leads an independent team of academic scientists overseeing Boston Scientific research. The company has no editorial control over the papers the scientists write, Dr. Saxon said.\n\nBoston Scientific gets data from patients\u2019 defibrillators. It also gets information on deaths from Medicare.\n\nThe data are stripped of patient identifiers and analyzed, a task requiring the company to become more like a Google or a Microsoft, handling enormous amounts of information. There are, for example, more than four million recordings of weights and blood pressures and over 60,000 instances when the defibrillators went off, shocking a patient\u2019s heart.\n\nSo far, Dr. Saxon\u2019s group has reported on the first 90,000 patients. Half of them had not been enrolled for remote monitoring and served as a control group.\n\nPatients whose doctors looked at the data survived 5 to 15 percent longer than patients in earlier clinical trials of the devices, Dr. Saxon reported. And, in a paper under review, the group reports that their three-year survival was significantly greater than that of patients in the study whose doctors did not see the data.\n\nOther researchers will be analyzing economic data. The devices can cost as much as $30,000. Do patients with defibrillators make up for some of that expense with fewer hospitalizations or doctor visits?\n\nA study using a similar device, made by Medtronic, suggests that is the case. The Medtronic study, directed by Dr. George Crossley, president of St Thomas Heart at Baptist Hospital in Nashville, involved 2,000 patients randomly assigned to receive a defibrillator that transmitted data or a device that did not transmit. Those with the nontransmitting device were seen in their doctor\u2019s offices every few months, the standard of care.\n\nPatients whose devices transmitted spent less time, on average, in the hospital when they were admitted \u2014 3.3 days compared with 4 days \u2014 and their hospital costs were $1,600 less per admission.\n\n\u201cThe plausible reason, we think, is that we got to these people much sooner in the course of their illness,\u201d Dr. Crossley said. \u201cWe think we did not let the people in the remote sensing group get into heart failure.\u201d\n\nStill, the information overload problem looms. One solution, being tested by St. Jude Medical, a medical device company in St. Paul, is to let patients deal with important data.\n\nThe idea, said Dr. Neal Eigler, a senior vice president at St. Jude, is to get heart patients to adjust their medications regularly based on readings of their heart\u2019s functioning, just as patients with diabetes adjust their insulin based on blood glucose readings.\n\nPatients hold a small device over their chest twice a day, and if they experience symptoms like shortness of breath. It transmits readings of blood pressure in the left atrium \u2014 the upper left chamber of the heart. If pressure in that chamber gets too high, the lungs can fill with fluid.\n\nDoctors preprogram the hand-held device to provide instructions to patients in response to their left atrial pressure measurements, telling them, for example, to take a different dose of a medication, restrict fluid intake, increase their activity level or call the clinic.\n\nIf successful, the smart device could have a big effect. One million patients a year are hospitalized for heart failure. Ninety percent of the time it is because fluid has accumulated in their lungs.\n\nDr. Stevenson, who has no connection with St. Jude, is intrigued. Patients can see what is happening to their own bodies and act accordingly. They have to strictly limit salt in their diet, for example, and seeing their left atrial pressure might be motivating.\n\n\u201cA patient might say, \u2018Maybe my pressure is higher because that pizza I had for dinner last night had a lot of salt,\u2019 \u201d Dr. Stevenson said.\n\nAs a more positive incentive, the device can also instruct patients to decrease their medications if they are doing well.\n\nSt. Jude recently completed a small study of 40 patients and is starting a large clinical trial. In the pilot study, the device reduced the frequency of high atrial pressure readings by two-thirds and the number of hospitalizations by 80 percent over five months.\n\nMeanwhile, patients whose doctors can deal with the data stream from smart devices say they are getting peace of mind.\n\nThey include people like Danielle Denlein, who, to her total shock, developed a serious heart problem.On October 20, 2008, at 1:50 p.m., Ms. Denlein was driving to a drug store to buy formula for her 5-day-old baby girl. Suddenly, she felt a pain in her chest. She thought it was heartburn. Then it began radiating down her arm.\n\n\u201cI just knew \u2014 I don\u2019t know how I knew, but I knew \u2014 I was having a heart attack,\u201d she said.\n\nAlthough she was only 35, her main coronary artery had ripped open, a rare complication associated with pregnancy.\n\nMs. Denlein now relies on her smart defibrillator to save her from her injured heart, and to alert her doctor, Dr. Saxon, to problems if they occur.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s life changing,\u201d Ms. Denlein said. \u201cIt gives me such a feeling of comfort.\u201d\n\nMrs. Elzo feels the same way.\n\nHad her device not alerted her doctor that it needed to be replaced, she said, \u201cI shudder to think what would have happened.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "\u00a0Information about the potential to increase longevity was presented from a study that has not yet been published. \u00a0The information was presented as a relative increase rather than an absolute increase. \u00a0The story didn\u2019t contain sufficient information to quantify the benefit to any specific group of patients.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "WASHINGTON -- Bacteria live on everyone\u2019s skin, and new research shows some friendly germs produce natural antibiotics that ward off their disease-causing cousins.

In lab tests and on the surface of animal skin, those substances could selectively kill Staph aureus, and even a drug-resistant strain known as MRSA, without killing neighboring bacteria like regular antibiotics do, the team reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\nBut those good bugs are rare in the skin of people with atopic dermatitis, Gallo said.\n\n\u201cPeople with this type of eczema, for some reason that\u2019s not quite known yet, have a lot of bacteria on the skin but it\u2019s the wrong type of bacteria.

The findings could be a significant step in treating people with resistant hypertension, which is a major risk factor for heart attack and stroke, the researchers said.\n\nThe technique -- called catheter-based renal denervation -- is minimally invasive. In it, doctors use a catheter inserted through the artery in the groin, which sends radio waves burning away nerve tissue around the arteries that feed the kidneys.\n\nThe procedure destroys nerves that help control and filter salt in the body and may be overactive in patients with high blood pressure.

There is thus an important, but currently unmet, need for additional therapies to effectively control hypertension.\"\n\nFor the study, an international team lead by Dr. Murray Esler, professor and senior director of the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne, Australia, assigned 35 patients to renal denervation and compared them to 47 patients who had already had the procedure.\n\nAll the patients suffered from drug-resistant hypertension. Their systolic blood pressure -- the top number in a blood-pressure reading -- remained dangerously high at 160 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) or above despite having taking three or more drugs to control blood pressure, the researchers noted.\n\nEsler's team found that more than 83 percent of those who had denervation treatment before had a drop in systolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg after six months and almost 79 percent maintained the reduction at 12 months.\n\nThe 35 patients in this phase of the study had similar results to the initial group. Almost 63 percent of these patients saw a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg or more six months after treatment.\n\nFonarow noted: \"In all, reductions in systolic blood-pressure levels on the order of 25 to 30 mmHg were achieved and maintained without any loss in efficacy.\"\n\nThe procedure is safe as well as effective, the study authors said.\n\n\"Participants' kidneys were not damaged or functionally impaired,\" Esler said in a journal news release. \"We also found no ill effects on long-term health from the procedure.\"\n\nWhether this technique might be useful in treating less severe high blood pressure hasn't yet been tested. If it is applicable, it could mean patients need not take blood-pressure drugs, Esler suggested.\n\nAnother expert, however, said that scenario is likely overoptimistic.\n\n\"Hypertension is a hard disease to treat because there are so many things that go into getting blood pressure under control,\" said Dr. Varinder Singh, chairman of cardiology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"There's lifestyle and diet, there is getting to the right doses of medications, there are adherence issues. So anything that will help patients get their goals is exciting.\"\n\nEven with this technique, people will most likely still have to take blood-pressure medications, Singh said. \"You may have to take less medication and you may have to take lower doses of medication, but we all expect that patients will still have to take some medication,\" he said.\n\nSingh also noted that although this procedure is used in other countries it is not yet approved in the United States.\n\nFonarow added: \"While this study demonstrates that renal denervation provides sustained reduction of blood pressure up to one year and appears safe, additional studies with longer-term follow-up are needed.\"\n\nAccording to the American Heart Association, more than 78 million adults in the United States have high blood pressure, which is blood pressure higher than 140/90 mmHg.\n\nAmong these adults, about 9 percent have resistant hypertension, which means that even taking three or more medications to control their blood pressure, it remains higher than 140/90 mmHg.\n\nTo learn more about hypertension, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story adequately reports what the researchers reported about decline in systolic blood pressure.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "TUESDAY, March 20, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Tiny pellets could treat arthritic knee pain, delaying the need for knee replacement surgery, a small study has found.\n\nMicroparticles inserted into small blood vessels around the knee helped reduce the pain and improve function in eight arthritis sufferers, according to clinical trial results. The results were presented Monday at the Society of Interventional Radiology's annual meeting, in Los Angeles.\n\n\"Patients overall were able to improve their physical function in the knee after the procedure, and there were no adverse events related to this treatment,\" said lead researcher Dr. Sandeep Bagla.\n\nBagla is director of interventional radiology at the Vascular Institute of Virginia in Woodbridge. Boston Scientific, maker of the microparticles, funded the study.\n\nMuch of the pain that comes from knee arthritis actually stems from inflammation in the lining of the knee joint, also called the synovium, Bagla said. In fact, small blood vessels created by degenerative arthritis feed this inflammation by increasing blood flow to the lining.\n\nTo treat this, Bagla and his colleagues decided to try blocking those tiny blood vessels using microparticles -- spheres about a tenth of a millimeter in size made from a synthetic gel-like material.\n\nThe microparticles are inserted using a catheter run through a pinhole-sized incision, in a procedure that lasts between 45 and 90 minutes, Bagla said.\n\n\"It's an outpatient procedure, and no physical therapy is required before or after this procedure,\" he said.\n\nThe small pilot study -- the first U.S. clinical trial of this procedure -- involved 20 patients with moderate to severe arthritis pain. Only 13 had undergone the procedure by the time of Monday's annual meeting, and only eight had made it to the one-month follow-up, Bagla said.\n\nThose eight patients averaged a 58-point decrease in pain, as measured on a 100-point visual scale used to estimate pain, Bagla said. They started with an average baseline of 72, which means their pain was brought down to manageable levels, he said.\n\nPhysical function of their knee also improved, based on an index used to judge the effects of osteoarthritis, Bagla added.\n\nOverall, the two scales represented an 80 percent improvement in function, the researchers concluded.\n\nBagla said no side effects are expected because the procedure only blocks additional blood flow to the knee, rather than cutting it off altogether.\n\n\"You don't normally have this degree of increased blood supply to this lining. We're not blocking normal blood vessels to the knee or leg or bone or cartilage,\" he said.\n\nFinal results from this clinical trial are expected to be released this summer. Researchers are already kicking off a second, larger trial to better understand how the procedure works and which patients it might benefit, Bagla said.\n\nThey think it will be most appropriate for people between ages 40 and 70 who aren't ready to go through knee replacement, or people who are on chronic pain medication for their knee arthritis, Bagla said.\n\n\"Perhaps we can demonstrate and prove patients do not need to be on these medications and can alternatively go through a minimally invasive procedure like this to reduce their knee pain,\" Bagla said.\n\nDr. Suresh Vedantham, president of the Society of Interventional Radiology, called the new procedure \"very promising,\" given that it focuses on the inflamed knee lining that causes the pain.\n\n\"This therapy is very well-targeted to that particular mechanism, and certainly it should be investigated further,\" said Vedantham, who wasn't involved with the study.

Common symptoms of PPD \u2013 a mood disorder in women that can be triggered by fluctuations in reproductive hormones \u2013 include low mood, feeling overwhelmed, anxious and ruminating thoughts, potential withdrawal from the baby and her family, and suicidal thoughts in the most severe cases.

Eligible women were aged 18-45 years old and were six months postpartum or less at screening. They also had to be experiencing moderate to severe postpartum depression, which was assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D).\n\nThe integrated analysis looked at results of the trials which randomized 209 women to receive a double-blinded 60-hour infusion of either brexanolone injection 90 \u00b5g/kg/hr or placebo. A unique dose group of brexanolone 60 \u00b5g/kg/hr in one of the studies was not included in the integrated efficacy analysis, but was included in integrated analyses of safety. Brexanolone injection 90 \u00b5g/kg/hr was administered to 102 women with moderate or severe PPD who also were evaluated throughout the infusion, after the infusion stopped and then periodically for up to 30 days. Another 107 women were administered a placebo and evaluated during the same timeframe. The first statistically significant reduction in depression severity with brexanolone injection relative to placebo was observed as early as 24 hours after dosing. At the end of the 60-hour infusion, the average reduction in patients\u2019 Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D or depression severity score) was 17.0 points for women in the brexanolone injection 90 \u00b5g/kg/hr group, versus 12.8 in the placebo group (p<0.0001). The reduction of symptoms in the patients receiving brexanolone injection was maintained throughout the last study visit at Day 30. The most common (\u226510% of subjects) adverse events following during brexanolone injection administration were headache, dizziness and somnolence.\n\n\u201cThis is a very different model for how we treat depression.

Berry, who works with the Division of Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.\n\nBut there's one notable exception to this success story \u2014 Hispanic women \u2014 and researchers think the reason may lie in a staple of their diet: tortillas.\n\nUnder current FDA rules, tortillas, corn chips and other foods made with corn masa flour can't be fortified with folic acid. So a coalition of groups including the March of Dimes Foundation and the National Council of La Raza has petitioned the FDA to change its stance and allow corn masa flour to be fortified with folic acid.\n\nAccording to the March of Dimes, about 3,000 pregnancies in the U.S. are affected by neural tube defects each year. The rates are highest among Hispanics: Latina women are roughly 20 percent more likely to have a baby with a neural tube defect compared to non-Latina white women.\n\nThe exact cause of this discrepancy isn't known. Researchers say there may be genetic factors that predispose the children of some Hispanic women to neural tube defects. But they suspect diet is also a factor: \"Part of the reason was that these groups just weren't consuming the same level of wheat flour products. Instead, they were consuming corn masa flour products, because that was the staple grain in that diet,\" says Cynthia Pellegrini, senior vice president of public policy and government affairs at the March of Dimes.\n\nResearch has shown that women who consume at least 400 micrograms of folic acid daily have a significantly reduced risk of having a pregnancy affected by neural tube defects \u2014 including spina bifida, which can involve paralysis, and anencephaly, in which large parts of the brain are missing. The catch: Folic acid is only protective if consumed in the earliest weeks of pregnancy.\n\n\"Most women, by the time they know they're pregnant, they've already passed that critical window,\" says Dean Appling, a biochemistry professor at the University of Texas at Austin. \"If they had a problem with folic acid, it would be too late at that point to prevent the birth defect.\"\n\nMandating fortification helps ensure that women are getting enough folic acid even before they know they need it. And studies suggest that fortifying corn masa with folic acid could prevent an additional 40 to 120 cases of neural tube defects among babies born to Hispanic mothers each year.\n\nSo why does the FDA currently ban dosing corn masa flour with folic acid? It all has to do with nixtamalization, the process by which tough corn kernels are softened by soaking in an alkaline solution, usually of slaked lime. The process, which hails from ancient Mesoamerica \u2014 what's now Mexico and Central America \u2014 dates back thousands of years. It renders the corn more pliable for grinding into masa flour and gives the masa its distinctive aroma and flavor.\n\nBut the FDA worries that this alkaline treatment could also \"affect the stability of added folic acid,\" the agency told The Salt in a statement. \"The FDA is concerned that the breakdown of folic acid in corn masa flour could yield a substance that raises concerns about safety.\"\n\nThe March of Dimes and others first petitioned the FDA to allow added folic acid in corn flour masa in 2012. As part of its review, the FDA asked the petitioning groups to study whether folic acid would stay stable in corn masa flour.\n\nThe petitioners filed the results of that study in October. Michael Dunn, the Brigham Young University food scientist who led the study, cannot comment on the test results while they're under FDA review, but he has previously called them encouraging. As The Seattle Times has reported, Dunn's early results suggested no loss of folic acid in fortified masa after three months of storage.\n\nThe March of Dimes' Pellegrini says she believes the FDA will respond to the results of Dunn's study later this month. But the FDA might have more questions related to the study before making a final ruling.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story gives the reader an idea of how many neural defects could be prevented by adding folic acid to corn flour. \u201cAnd studies suggest that fortifying corn masa with folic acid could prevent an additional 40 to 120 cases of neural tube defects among babies born to Hispanic mothers each year.\u201d", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Any woman who is struggling with infertility will tell you that one of the worst parts of going through in vitro fertilization (IVF) are the daily hormone injections. And for some women, those injections could even be downright dangerous.\n\nAlthough IVF is still considered the gold standard, there\u2019s an infertility treatment available that is offering hope \u2014 in vitro maturation (IVM). IVM has the potential to improve the chances for women to have babies without a long course of hormones.\n\nWhat is IVM?\n\n IVM is an experimental fertility treatment that collects and matures a woman\u2019s eggs in a lab. Although the treatment is used in conjunction with IVF, the initial process isn\u2019t the same.\n\nWith IVF, a woman must undergo between 8 to 11 nights of ovary-stimulating hormone injections before her eggs can be retrieved. With IVM, women undergo a shorter course\u2014 between 3 and 6 days\u2014 of hormones known as a \u201cpriming phase.\u201d\n\nOnce the eggs are retrieved, they\u2019re matured in a laboratory for approximately three days, fertilized and then implanted. They can also be frozen as eggs or embryos to be implanted later.\n\nClinics that specialize in IVM require a doctor who has expertise in retrieving small eggs and a lab with embryologists who have the skills to look for them, said Dr. Janelle Luk, medical director of Neway Fertility in New York City.\n\nWho is IVM helpful for?\n\nAlthough IVF is considered the standard of care, experts say some women may benefit from IVM.\n\nFor starters, since there is less time involved with IVM, women who are undergoing chemotherapy, radiation or plan to have surgery may be good candidates.\n\nIVM may also help women who have a contraindication to the increased levels of estradiol, a form of estrogen, which elevates as the follicles develop and mature. These would include women with an estrogen-sensitive cancer or a history of blood clots.\n\nIVM can also help women who are adverse to injections or who have failed IVF, Luk said.\n\nWomen with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or who are at increased risk for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\u2014 which affects between 3 and 6 percent of women who go through IVF\u2014 may also benefit from IVM. OHSS can usually be managed on an outpatient basis but severe OHSS may lead to blood clots, even death, said Dr. Shefali Shastri, a board-certified reproductive endocrinologist and OB/GYN at Reproductive Medicine Associates of New Jersey in Somerset and Short Hills.\n\nWhat are the limitations of IVM? \n\nA study in the journal Facts, Views and Vision found that IVM achieved up to a 35 percent clinical pregnancy rate in young women, which is comparable to IVF.\n\nYet most studies have found that IVF is superior to IVM.\n\nAlthough there are different protocols for IVF, and there aren\u2019t any randomized controlled trials that have compared IVF and IVM side by side, studies that look at standard IVF cycles show a significantly higher pregnancy rate than IVM, Shastri said.\n\nPlus, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) committee opinion on IVM states that implantation rates for IVM\u2014between 5.5 and 21.6 percent\u2014 are a more reliable indicator of IVM success and are lower than expected for women of the same age who use IVF. They also note that the technology hasn\u2019t been widely used and that there are no studies looking at the outcomes of birth defects or developmental delays.\n\nSince IVM results in lower fertilization rates, protocols that use IVM are more likely to also use intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), in which one sperm is injected into one egg. Although ICSI is safe and effective, the bigger concern is if a patient going through IVM doesn\u2019t use ICSI, Shastri said.\n\nWhile IVM is cheaper initially because there are fewer hormones to take, it may be more costly if several rounds are required.\n\nAlthough IVM may eventually become more common, IVF still remains the standard of care and the most effective way for women to get pregnant.\n\n\u201cWith medicine, you always want to optimize a patient\u2019s outcome,\u201d Shastri said. \u201cUltimately, you want to do the best for the patient so my preference would not be IVM.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "We award a Satisfactory rating here because the story does quote a range of claimed \u201cimplantation\u201d success rates for IVM and IVF given by the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, noting that IVM appears to have much lower success rates.

Michael Brunt, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis. \"One repair isn't appropriate for all circumstances.\"\n\nHernias occur when part of an internal organ, such as the intestines, bulges out through muscle. At issue are the surgical approaches that physicians use when a patient suffers from a hernia in the groin.\n\nThe procedures are designed to reduce the bulge of the hernia and make a patch so it doesn't protrude again. \"It's as if you had a leak in a tire that's ballooned out,\" Brunt said. \"You'll patch it to prevent it from continuing to protrude.\"\n\nThe study, led by researchers at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, examined two procedures.\n\nOne procedure, known as total extraperitoneal inguinal hernioplasty, is performed under a general anesthetic and uses a laparoscopic approach through a small opening. It was developed in the 1990s, Brunt said.\n\nThe other approach is older and is performed through a 2- to 2.5-inch incision in the groin, Brunt said. It can be done under local anesthesia.

Eating barley or foods containing barley significantly reduced levels of two types of \"bad cholesterol\" associated with cardiovascular risk, a St. Michael's Hospital research paper has found.\n\nBarley reduced both low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, and non-high-density lipoprotein, or non-HDL, by seven per cent.\n\nThe review also indicated that barley had similar cholesterol-lowering effects as oats, which is often the go-to grain for health benefits.\n\nThe research review, published today in The European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, included 14 studies on clinical trials conducted in seven countries, including Canada.\n\nIt is the first study to look at the effects of barley and barley products on both LDL and non-HDL cholesterol in addition to apolipoprotein B, or apoB, a lipoprotein that carries bad cholesterol through the blood. Measuring non-HDL and apoB provides a more accurate assessment for cardiovascular risk, as they account for the total 'bad cholesterol' found in the blood.\n\n\"The findings are most important for populations at high risk for cardiovascular disease, such as Type 2 diabetics, who have normal levels of LDL cholesterol, but elevated levels of non-HDL or apo B,\" said Dr. Vladimir Vuksan, research scientist and associate director of the Risk Factor Modification Centre of St. Michael's. \"Barley has a lowering effect on the total bad cholesterol in these high-risk individuals, but can also benefit people without high cholesterol.\"\n\nHigh cholesterol and diabetes are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease and stroke, historically treated with medications. However, Dr. Vuksan's research and work focuses on how dietary and lifestyle changes can reduce these risk factors.\n\n\"Barley's positive effect on lowering cholesterol is well-documented and has been included in the Canadian strategy for reducing cardiovascular risk,\" said Dr. Vuksan. \"Health Canada, the FDA and several health authorities worldwide have already approved health claims that barley lowers LDL cholesterol, but this is the first review showing the effects on other harmful lipids.\"\n\nDespite its benefits Dr. Vuksan said barley is not as well-established as some other health-recommended foods -- such as oats. Barley consumption by humans has fallen by 35 per cent in the last 10 years. Canada is one of the top five world producers of barley -- almost 10 megatonnes per year -- but human consumption accounts for only two per cent of the crop yield, with livestock making up the other 98 per cent. \"After looking at the evidence, we can also say that barley is comparably effective as oats in reducing overall risk of cardiovascular disease\" said Dr. Vuksan.\n\nBarley is higher in fibre, has twice the protein and almost half the calories of oats, which are important considerations for those with weight or dietary concerns.\n\nDr. Vuksan said barley can be enjoyed in a variety of ways. He recommends trying to incorporate barley into existing recipes, using it as a substitute for rice or even on its own -- just like oatmeal.\n\nSt. Michael's Hospital provides compassionate care to all who enter its doors.

Until recently, people with advanced melanoma often died within a year of diagnosis, even with chemotherapy.\n\nFor the first time, however, patients such as Herry have options.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved two new melanoma drugs in 2011 \u2014 the first new therapy for the disease in more than a decade \u2014 and approved two from GlaxoSmithKline on Wednesday. All improve survival by a few months.\n\nThe FDA also has put a Merck melanoma drug, lambrolizumab, on a fast track to approval by designating it a \"breakthrough\" therapy.\n\nSeveral other drug companies are also working on melanoma therapies.\n\nMelanoma research will take center stage at the four-day annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which begins Friday in Chicago. Doctors will present 288 melanoma studies, compared to only 62 a decade ago.\n\n\"The number of new melanoma therapies is sort of astonishing,\" says melanoma researcher Lynn Schuchter, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. \"The pace is unbelievable.\"\n\nNo one can claim to have cured melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, which is diagnosed in 77,000 Americans a year and kills more than 9,400.\n\nBut after decades of failure, the spate of new drugs is helping more patients than ever before, giving people like Herry more time and better quality of life, Schuchter says. Doctors now dare to hope that giving these new drugs in sequence, or in combination, will help people with melanoma live for years while feeling relatively good.\n\nUnlike traditional chemo, which indiscriminately kills growing cells, the new generation of melanoma drugs work in a precise way, based on a better understanding of the specific genes and proteins that drive cancer growth, says Timothy Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation.\n\n\"The reason we're seeing these breakthroughs is because we did the basic science research to help us understand how this cancer happens, how it escapes therapy and how it progresses,\" Turnham says.\n\nMany of the new drugs aim to remove melanoma's \"cloaking device,\" allowing it to be recognized and killed by the immune system, says Roy Herbst, chief of medical oncology at the Yale Cancer Center.\n\nOther drugs \u2014 such as the two approved Wednesday, trametinib and dabrafenib \u2014 target growth signals within cancer cells.\n\nHerry has tried two of the newer drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb: ipilumumab, approved in 2011, and an experimental drug called nivolumab.\n\nAlthough her tumors increased while taking ipilumumab, Herry says a CT scan earlier this year found they had shrunk by half after beginning nivolumab.\n\nThe most noticeable side effects from nivolumab have been moderate fatigue and vitiligo, a loss of pigment on some areas of her hands and arms, says Herry, 57, from Santa Cruz, Calif. She's been able to continue working as a registered nurse throughout these latest treatments.\n\nOlder melanoma therapies \u2014 including interferon, interleukin-2 and five chemo drugs \u2014 caused much more serious side effects, leaving her too sick to work, Herry says.\n\nWhen the new immune therapies work, they often keep cancer at bay for a long time, says Schuchter, who has patients whose cancer has been controlled by ipilumumab for three years.\n\nAt the cancer meeting, featured presentations include a study by researcher Mario Sznol, of the Yale Cancer Center, who will discuss long-term results of nivolumab. Researcher Stephen Hodi, of Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, will present the results of combining ipilumumab with an immune-stimulating drug. Doctors from New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center will present research on uveal melanoma, which occurs in the eye, and affects about 1,200 Americans a year.\n\nOther studies released in advance of the conference have shown positive results.\n\nNone of the new drugs works for everyone. And none are risk-free.\n\nIpilumumab can cause severe side effects, created when the immune system attacks the body itself, Schuchter says. Vemurafenib, approved in 2011, can cause non-lethal skin cancers.\n\n\"Doctors will say, 'There are side effects, but they are manageable,'\" Turnham says. \"Well, 'manageable' can mean something different to patients.\"\n\nTurnham knew a 19-year-old woman with melanoma who \"woke up bleeding every morning\" because of rashes caused by one of the new drugs, which targets mutations in a gene called MEK. The woman died a year later.\n\nDrugs such as ipilumumab can seem like breakthroughs to doctors because they help 15% of patients.

Using this technology is still seen as a stopgap, however, while a biological solution to diabetes is sought.\n\n\"We have pioneered the development of a closed-loop artificial pancreas because we believe it will significantly impact the lives of individuals with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, by providing exquisite control of blood sugar,\" Dr. Richard A.

Too much insulin can cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), which can be life-threatening, while too little causes the serious damage of diabetes such as kidney, vision and circulation problems.\n\n\"The promise in the near term of these technologies is not only to help us reduce significantly the risk of long-term diabetic complications, but also to reduce the risk of having a catastrophic hypoglycemic event, and further help people with diabetes live easier,\" Aaron Kowalski, research director of the JDRF's Artificial Pancreas Project, said during the teleconference.\n\n\"This will help keep people healthy while we drive toward a biological approach, which will take longer,\" he said.\n\nIn the first report, Dr. Roman Hovorka, a principal research associate in the department of pediatrics at the University of Cambridge, reported that the technology can significantly improve overnight blood sugar control in adults without the fear of developing hypoglycemia. With the technology, patients maintained their blood sugar levels within the target range for 70 percent of the time, compared to 47 percent of the time among those not using the technology.\n\nMoreover, glucose control was demonstrated in real-life situations such as after a large meal and having a glass of white wine.\n\n\"We let them consume about three-quarters of a bottle of wine to simulate what happens after a large meal,\" Hovorka said during Saturday's teleconference. \"What has been shown is that drinking alcohol in the evening causes hypoglycemia early in the morning.\"\n\nThese results were similar to findings in children where the system extended the amount of time spent at target blood sugar levels, he added. \"We reduced hypoglycemia by half,\" he said.\n\n\"Our plan is to move into home studies, which hopefully will happen later on this year,\" Hovorka said.\n\nMeanwhile, Marilyn Ritholz, a senior psychologist at the Joslin Diabetes Center and an assistant professor of psychology at the Harvard Medical School, reported on a study on psychological barriers to continuous blood sugar monitoring.\n\n\"So far, studies have not shown which factors predict which factors are associated with successful or unsuccessful continuous glucose monitoring [CGM],\" she said during the teleconference.\n\nRitholz's team found that people who were better at coping with the frustration of using the device were more successful at keeping their blood sugar under control.\n\nFrustrations included warning alarms and problems at the insertion point of the device. \"We found that the people who did well used a more problem-solving approach and persisted in trying to learn how to use the CGM,\" she said.\n\nPeople who were not successful used \"emotion-based coping,\" Ritholz said. \"They easily became overwhelmed and they just gave up.\"\n\nIn addition, successful people had more involvement and support from their spouse or \"significant other,\" she added.

She is also president of HealthStat Consulting Inc. in Seattle.\n\nThe new study, like previous ones, re-ignites the ongoing debate about the best age to start routine mammograms and the best screening interval. It appears in the March issue of the journal Radiology.\n\nIn 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued mammogram recommendations. It recommends women aged 50 to 74 who are at average risk for breast cancer have a mammogram done every two years. It also suggests that women aged 40 to 49 at average risk discuss the pros and cons with their doctors and decide on an individual basis if and when to start screening.\n\nMeanwhile, other organizations, including the American Cancer Society, recommend women begin mammograms at age 40 and continue to have them annually.\n\nMalmgren and her colleagues evaluated nearly 2,000 women who had breast cancer. All were aged 40 to 49 when they were treated between 1990 and 2008.\n\nThe researchers looked at the method of diagnosis, whether by mammogram or if the cancer was found by the doctor or the woman. They also took these into account: the cancer's stage at diagnosis; type of treatment; annual follow-up; recurrence; and survival.\n\nOver the 18-year period, the number of breast cancers diagnosed at very early stages increased 66 percent, while the number of more advanced cancers (stage 3) decreased by 66 percent.\n\nThose whose cancers were detected by mammogram rose from 28 percent in 1990 to 58 percent in 2008. The number of cancers detected by doctor or patients declined from 73 percent in 1990 to 42 percent in 2008.\n\nWomen whose cancers were detected by mammograms were more likely than the doctor- or patient-detected cancers to have lumpectomy or other breast-conserving surgery: 67 percent vs. 48 percent. The women whose cancers were detected by mammograms were less likely to be given chemotherapy.\n\nWhile 4 percent of women whose cancer was found on mammogram died during a follow-up period that ranged from one to 20 years, 11 percent of those whose cancers were found by the doctor or the women died.\n\nWhen the researchers looked only at invasive cancers, 92 percent of the women whose cancer was found on mammogram survived without recurrence at five years; 88 percent of the other group did.\n\n\"I don't think the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force is looking at the whole picture,\" Malmgren said. \"They are concentrating on the harms.\"\n\nAmong them, according to the 2009 guidelines, are false-positives, which can lead to anxiety and unnecessary biopsies.\n\nMalmgren, a breast cancer survivor, says more focus should be placed on the benefit of early diagnosis, because it often means less treatment is needed.\n\nThere was a decrease found in cancers being diagnosed at later stages in those whose cancers were found on mammograms. \"That's where the money is,\" Malmgren said.\n\nDr. Virginia Moyer, chair of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and a professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine, reviewed the study. \"The findings make sense,\" she said.\n\nThey found that cancers can be detected earlier by mammogram. \"A screening test, if it can't find something earlier than [by] clinical presentation, is a poor test,\" she said.\n\nHowever, she said, the study does not provide support for all women aged 40 to 49 to have routine mammograms.\n\nWhen considering its recommendation, the task force took all available evidence into account, including published studies, Moyer noted. \"The data from randomized trials and modeling show there is a very modest improvement in mortality with mammograms from 40 to 49,\" she said.\n\n\"Because it is so modest and there are risks, people need to make their own decision,\" Moyer said.\n\nTo learn more about mammograms, go to the U.S. National Cancer Institute.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "We\u2019ll give the story the benefit of the doubt for presenting lots of numbers \u2013 in contrast with the WebMD story that included NONE.\nHowever, more critical analysis would have been appreciated.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Surgeons sometimes fly blind when operating on hard-to-reach anatomical parts or hard-to-see conditions.

The kids also missed fewer days of school and were less likely to need medical care.\n\nHowever, this strong benefit only applies to the first couple of years following surgery, Chinnadurai said. By the third year, there was no clear benefit in terms of the number of throat infections. Also, there was limited research on long-term results.\n\n\"The decision about whether those children should have tonsillectomy for that temporary benefit is really tied to what those children need or what they're suffering with,\" Chinnadurai said. Kids who miss a lot of school or need frequent trips to the doctor due to sore throats could benefit from the surgery, he said.\n\nThere's an even clearer benefit for kids whose sleep is disturbed due to inflamed tonsils, Chinnadurai said.\n\n\"In a child with a diagnosis of sleep apnea, we can see a benefit in sleep-related quality of life,\" he said. The kids get better sleep, and thus exhibit better everyday behavior and pay more attention in school.\n\nThe medical approach to treating tonsil infections has evolved over recent decades.\n\nTonsillectomy is the third most common surgery performed on U.S. children, with 530,000 such procedures completed each year, according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck Surgery.\n\nThirty years ago, nine out of 10 tonsillectomies in children were performed to treat recurring throat infections. These days, the procedure is done 20 percent of the time for infections and 80 percent of the time for sleep problems, according to the academy.\n\nSwollen tonsils can block the airway during sleep, causing breathing problems that range from simple snoring to obstructive sleep apnea, the researchers said in background notes.\n\nGuidelines say a tonsillectomy to treat throat infections is justified if a child had seven or more sore throats during the previous year; five or more sore throats two years running, or three or more sore throats for three years in a row, according to the background notes.\n\nThe researchers decided to review whether the throat infection guidelines are too stringent, ruling out patients who potentially could benefit but don't meet the high threshold of recurring infections, Chinnadurai said.\n\nThere aren't strong guidelines regarding the use of tonsillectomy to treat sleep disorders, so the doctors reviewed the evidence to see whether the surgery outperformed so-called watchful waiting -- monitoring the situation.\n\nThe study results showed \"there may be new evidence that supports expanding the criteria and opening up the procedure to more individuals,\" said Dr. Alyssa Hackett, an otolaryngologist with the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai in New York City.\n\n\"In the right child with the right indications, these are really wonderful procedures that can be life-changing for both the child and the family,\" said Hackett, who wasn't involved with the new research.\n\n\"If you need your appendix out, you need your appendix out,\" Hackett said. \"But for the tonsils and adenoids, there are great quality-of-life benefits that are evident for the surgery, but no child has ever died because they haven't gone through the surgery.\" (Adenoids, glands at the roof of the mouth, are often removed along with tonsils.)\n\nStill, Chinnadurai and Hackett warned against automatically choosing the surgery for every sore throat.\n\nAbout 3 percent of kids who undergo the procedure experience bleeding during the two-week recovery period, Hackett said.\n\n\"Though a tonsillectomy is low-risk, it is not risk-free, and those risks need to be weighed against the benefits for each individual child,\" Chinnadurai said.\n\n\"We're talking about a child who has significant sleep-related issues,\" Hackett said. \"We don't want people to say my child snores, they need to have their tonsils out. That's not what this study says at all.\"\n\nThe two reports were published online Jan. 17 in the journal Pediatrics.\n\nFor more on tonsillectomy, visit the American Academy of Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck Surgery.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "There is little quantification of the benefits claimed in this story.

This is hardly life-changing.\nIt does say that in terms of throat infections, that kids receiving tonsillectomies showed fewer infections in the year following the procedure than did kids not undergoing the surgery, but that advantage disappeared after the first year or so.\nThe story rightfully points out that kids experiencing obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (OSDB) appeared to benefit from the surgery compared to those in the watchful waiting group.

(June 1, 2016) - A two-year, multi-center clinical study with 167 patients with class III-IV refractory angina randomized to low and high dose CD34+ cells or placebo has revealed that patients who received either a high or low dose of CD34 -- a member of a family of proteins that have an impact on vascular-associated tissue -- cells had a significant reduction in angina frequency over patients who received placebo. The patients, who were unresponsive to other treatments, were considered to have no other options (refractory).\n\nThe researchers used intramyocardial delivery into the ischemic zone after 3-D mapping to register both electrical and mechanical activities of the left ventricle.\n\nOutcomes from the \"ACT-34-CMI\" study, a two-year, phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, will be published in an upcoming cardiac issue of Cell Transplantation.\n\n\"There are an increasing number of patients with advanced coronary artery disease that are not amenable to surgical or percutaneous revascularization,\" said study co-author Dr. Timothy D. Henry of the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute. \"These patients frequently have symptoms after having had standard therapies and are left with limited treatment options. Encouraging early clinical trials suggest that cell therapy is an attractive treatment option for these patients, especially trials in which subjects were transplanted with autologous (self-donated) CD34+ cells.\"\n\nCD34+ cells drew the attention of researchers for possible therapeutic testing because recent studies pointed to the importance of CD34+ cell content in the bone marrow of patients with risk factors for coronary artery disease in predicting not only baseline, but also future exercise capacity.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the study demonstrated that CD34+ cells have the ability to restore the microcirculation and improve myocardial tissue perfusion. All of the 167 patients participating in the ACT34-CMI study saw significant improvement in both angina frequency and exercise at 12 months and a trend toward decreasing major cardiac events. There was also a reduction in angina in the placebo group at six months, but the effect was less prominent at 12 and 24 months, reported the researchers. In addition, there was a significant reduction in the time to first hospitalization in cell-treated patients, with a trend toward reduction in mortality as well.\n\n\"The results of our study are even more provocative given that the outcomes represent the effect of a single treatment,\" wrote the researchers. \"Recent reports suggest that in patients with recurring symptoms, repeated cell administration may replicate the initial positive results.\"\n\nThe researchers concluded that for \"no option\" patients with class III/IV angina refractory that was unresponsive to conventional medical therapy and who were not candidates for revascularization, injection of CD34+ cells resulted in persistent improvement in angina at two years post-treatment.\n\nCitation: Henry TD, Schaer GL, Traverse JH, Povisc TJ, Davidson C, Lee, JS, Costa MA, Bass T, Mendelsohn F, Fortuin FD, Pepine CJ, Patel AN, Riedel N, Junge C, Hunt A, Kereiakes DJ, White C, Harrington RA, Schatz RA, Losordo DW, the ACT34-CMI Investigators.

A nationwide survey by the National Institutes of Health found that 28 percent of adults in the U.S. are heavy drinkers or drink more than is recommended.\n\nYet, most heavy drinkers don't get the help they need.\n\n\"The biggest problem we have in the field is that less than 10 percent of individuals with an alcohol use disorder get any treatment whatsoever,\" says George Koob, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.\n\nPart of the challenge, researchers say, is that many drinkers don't realize that a medicine long used to help people addicted to opioids quit their drug habit can help alcoholics and other heavy drinkers cut back, too.\n\n\"I thought my only option was AA,\" John tells NPR. We've agreed to use only his middle name; disclosing his trouble with alcohol publicly, he says, would jeopardize his business.\n\nHe's a 47-year-old professional who says he started out as a social drinker \u2014 a few beers with his softball team after a game. But he sank into a deep depression after several deaths in his family, and sought \"solace in the bottle,\" he says.\n\n\"I wanted to numb my thoughts,\" says John.\n\nHe'd often start with hard liquor in the morning, John says, and it wasn't uncommon to have eight drinks or more before the end of the day.\n\nHe worked from home, so he was able to mask the problem for a while. But eventually his wife confronted him.\n\n\"She had come home and I was rushing to hide a glass and she was furious with me,\" he recalls. \"Just absolutely furious.\"\n\nHe went to see Paula DeSanto, a therapist and director of Minnesota Alternatives, in Spring Lake Park, Minn. The center provides outpatient mental health and substance use treatment services.\n\n\"I would say John's story is not unique,\" DeSanto tells us. \"A lot of people are reluctant.\"\n\nSometimes, traditional treatments \u2014 such as residential rehab or a 12-step program like Alcoholics Anonymous \u2014 \"can [lead to] a significant disruption in their lives,\" she explains. \"There's stigma, shame and embarrassment.\"\n\nDeSanto suggested a different approach to John. To help work through the loss and grief he was feeling, counseling can help, she told him. She also recommended he try naltrexone, a prescription drug.\n\n\"Naltrexone is an effective medication for the treatment of alcohol use disorders,\" says Koob. He points to a recent meta-analysis published in the journal Addiction that concluded that naltrexone helped reduce heavy drinking and cravings for alcohol.\n\nThe analysis included data from 64 clinical trials in which people were given either the medication or a placebo pill to test the effectiveness of the treatment. The analysis also found that another drug, acamprosate, is effective at helping people who have already stopped drinking to maintain abstinence, perhaps partly by easing the physical and emotional cravings experienced by heavy drinkers who quit.\n\nSo, how does naltrexone work? The drug seems to curb the euphoric and sedative effects of opiates in the brain. Alcohol is known to activate some of the same receptors in the brain that opioids do, and studies find that by tempering the pleasure from alcohol, naltrexone can help people drink less.\n\n\"It blunts the effects of alcohol,\" says Koob. \"People [who use naltrexone] will say they have a drink, and it's not doing much for them.\"\n\nThat was exactly John's experience. After taking the naltrexone pill, he didn't get the buzz he was used to getting, so didn't want to keep drinking. \"I actually didn't feel the alcohol's effects,\" he says. \"It was startling.\"\n\nIt's now been about five months since he started taking the medication. He has not stopped drinking completely, but says he has cut way back.\n\n\"This is helping me,\" John says. \"I can go out with friends and not worry that I'm going to end up inebriated or sloppy.\"\n\nAccording to the findings of a recent review, both naltrexone and acamprosate, are safe, cost-effective and efficacious. But they are substantially underused, according to the review.\n\nMany physicians are \"unaware that there are medications to treat alcohol use disorders,\" says Koob. His institute is stepping up efforts to work with the medical community on that front, he says, and is also touting Rethinking Drinking, a website aimed at consumers that offers the latest research-based information on a range of treatment options.\n\nAny health care provider who is licensed to prescribe medicine can prescribe naltrexone \u2014 not just mental health professionals or addiction specialists. As as long ago as 1997, a published study showed that treatment of alcohol dependence with naltrexone by primary care doctors can be effective; follow-up research has confirmed that the primary care approach not only works, but makes treatment much more accessible.\n\nAccording to the NIAAA, \"patients can now receive effective alcohol treatment from their primary care doctors or mental health practitioners by combining the newer medications with a series of brief office visits for support.\"\n\nNaltrexone is certainly not a cure-all, researchers say. And it won't help everyone who has a drinking problem \u2014 especially if the disorder is severe.\n\n\"I use these medications as an adjunct to therapy, and group [sessions] and 12-step meetings\" says Dr. Jeffrey Hsu, a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University who is certified in addiction medicine.

Graves.\n\nPhysicians will \"be able to use a simple blood test and then know that this woman is at increased risk or reduced risk of a preterm birth,\" said Graves, whose laboratory performed the research in the study.\n\nAbout 10 percent of births are premature, and the rate rises to 30 percent among women who have already had a baby prematurely, Graves said. Premature birth can lead to a long list of medical problems and puts babies at risk of dying.\n\nIn the new study, the researchers examined blood samples from 80 women who went on to have normal births and 80 who had premature births. They tried to find signs in the blood that indicate what kind of birth the women would have.\n\nThe researchers developed a screening method that looked for so-called peptide biomarkers in the blood that -- in tandem with several other proteins -- predicted 80 percent to 90 percent of the premature births at 28 weeks of gestation. The false positive rate -- referring to tests that wrongly indicated premature birth -- was 20 percent.\n\nThe test wasn't as effective at 24 weeks of gestation.\n\n\"This may simply indicate that some of the causes for preterm birth may not pre-exist before the pregnancy,\" Graves said. \"Most probably don't, but develop or become apparent as the pregnancy progresses.

It would require several years to go through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval process.

The new findings show that black tea polyphenols, which are too large to be absorbed in the small intestine, stimulate the growth of gut bacterium and the formation of short-chain fatty acids, a type of bacterial metabolites that has been shown to alter the energy metabolism in the liver.\n\n\"It was known that green tea polyphenols are more effective and offer more health benefits than black tea polyphenols since green tea chemicals are absorbed into the blood and tissue,\" said Susanne Henning, the study's lead author and an adjunct professor at the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition, which is part of the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. \"Our new findings suggest that black tea, through a specific mechanism through the gut microbiome, may also contribute to good health and weight loss in humans.\"\n\n\"The results suggest that both green and black teas are prebiotics, substances that induce the growth of good microorganisms that contribute to a person's well-being,\" she said.\n\nIn the study, four groups of mice received different diets -- two of which were supplemented with green tea or black tea extracts:\n\nAfter four weeks, the weights of the mice that were given green or black tea extracts dropped to the same levels as those of the mice that received the low-fat diet throughout the study.\n\nThe researchers also collected samples from the mice's large intestines (to measure bacteria content) and liver tissues (to measure fat deposits).

For decades, doctors have treated it with medications designed to keep blood sugar levels down.\n\nBut in a paper published in the , researchers in the UK describe a landmark study in which people with diabetes went into remission\u2014just by losing weight.\n\nNearly half of people in the study who were given a six-month diet plan and lost an average of 30 pounds went into remission and no longer had diabetes. None took any medications during that time to control their disease and relied on weight loss alone.\n\nType 2 diabetes is caused by the body\u2019s in ability to break down sugars from the diet. Normally, cells in the pancreas work to release insulin, a hormone that can process sugar and either send it to cells that need it for energy or store it as fat for future energy needs. Cells in the liver are responsible for clearing insulin from the circulation. But excess fat in the pancreas and liver can start to shut down these insulin-producing cells, leading to spikes in blood sugar levels. Diabetes medications can bring sugar levels down but do not address the compromised insulin machinery.\n\nIn the study, Dr. Roy Taylor, professor of medicine and metabolism at Newcastle University, and his colleagues randomly assigned nearly 300 people to either a weight management program or their usual treatments, including diabetes medications. All of the people had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in the six years preceding the study. The people assigned to the diet group stopped any diabetes drugs they were taking on the same day they began the diet.\n\nThe diet, which was designed to help people lose up to 30 pounds, involved three to five months of a strict low-calorie liquid formula diet averaging no more than 850 calories a day, followed by two to eight weeks of reintroducing food, along with nutritional education and cognitive behavioral therapy to help people stick with the new eating plan.\n\nTaylor and his team tracked outcomes including weight loss, diabetes remission and level of fat in the pancreas and liver. After a year, most of the people in the diet group lost about 22 pounds, compared to two pounds in the control group. Nearly a quarter of the people who managed their weight were able to lose 33 pounds or more, while none in the control group were able to lose that much. Most importantly, 46% of the people in the diet group went into remission with their diabetes, compared to just 4% in the control group.\n\nMORE: Antibiotics Are Linked To Type-2 Diabetes\n\n\u201cPeople newly diagnosed with diabetes for the first time can look at this and know it isn\u2019t necessarily for life,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cIt isn\u2019t an irreversible, inexorable condition that you can never escape from \u2014 at the moment, people are told that.\u201d\n\nPrevious studies have suggested that lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, can be powerful ways to lose weight and combat diabetes. The Diabetes Prevention Program in the U.S. revealed in 2002 that diet and exercise alone can prevent people from progressing from pre-diabetes to diabetes, in some cases better than medications designed to control blood sugar. Gastric bypass surgery, which can result in dramatic weight loss, can also help to reverse diabetes, but the procedure is costly and carries a high risk of complications.\n\nThe current study takes that work a step further and shows that it\u2019s possible to actually reverse the disease in people who have been diagnosed. Taylor stresses that the study only addressed people diagnosed relatively recently \u2014 within the past six years \u2014 and that the effect may not apply to more long-term patients. That\u2019s because as the disease continues, he says, insulin-producing cells start to die off. Initially, the cells slowly shut down, entering a so-called resting state. Those are the cells that weight loss can re-activate.\n\nBut left in this state too long, the cells eventually die and cannot be revived. Studies suggest that people living with diabetes for more than 10 years, for example, may not be able to rely on weight loss alone to push them into remission.\n\nThat points to an important lesson that Taylor hopes doctors and patients will learn from the results. He says that it\u2019s critical to discuss from the start \u2014 when people are diagnosed with diabetes \u2014 the possibility of using diet and weight loss to treat their disease. If more people can benefit from losing weight alone, then that would mean less cost to the health care system, as fewer people will suffer the serious complications of advanced disease, which can include heart problems, neuropathy, vision issues and even amputations.\n\nTaylor says he intends to follow up on the people in the study for another four years to see if they are able to maintain their weight, and, if they are, whether they continue to remain in remission. \u201cFrom the very clear data we produced in this trial, yes, this is a watershed moment for diabetes,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can offer people hope from the start.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story quantifies how much weight people lost and how many people went into remission, both in the group on the liquid diet and the control group (in which subject received the usual care for diabetes).

It also appears to have less risk of causing lung problems than its inhaled predecessor, Exubera.\n\n\"Afrezza is an ultra-rapid-acting insulin, and clinical studies have shown us that it has the potential to change diabetes therapy, because in the body, Afrezza looks like the insulin that's normally in a person's body,\" said Andrea Leone-Bay, vice president of pharmaceutical development for MannKind Corp., manufacturer of Afreeza.\n\n\"Afrezza differs a lot from Exubera,\" she said, both in the way it's made and in the way it works.\n\nAfrezza uses a novel technology called Technosphere, according to Leone-Bay. It's inhaled as a dry powder that dissolves in the lungs. The particles then pass through the lungs into the bloodstream and begin acting almost immediately. Afrezza's action peaks about 12 to 15 minutes after inhalation, instead of the 45 to 60 minutes it takes for Exubera to peak, she said.\n\nThat fast action helps to keep after-meal blood sugar levels lower, which is a goal for people with diabetes. And Afrezza is less likely to cause hypoglycemia, a common problem that occurs when insulin levels are higher than required for a meal.\n\nThe idea of an inhaled insulin appeals to diabetics who must use insulin every time they eat. Currently, the only way to get that insulin is through injection or an insulin pump that must be inserted in a new site under the skin every few days.\n\nIn 2006, the first inhaled insulin, Exubera, received FDA approval. However, the drug was pulled from the market in October 2007 by its manufacturer, Pfizer, because of disappointing sales. From the beginning, concerns surfaced about the effects the drug might have on the lungs. One study found a reduction in lung function for some, but of more concern was an increased risk of lung cancer associated with its use. This finding came after Exubera had been pulled from the market, and the sample size wasn't large enough to draw a definitive link between the drug and the increased risk of lung cancer.\n\nLeone-Bay said that cancer studies have been conducted on Afrezza in rats. The rats got a much higher inhalation dose than humans would take, and the researchers didn't find an increase in lung cancer. She said these types of studies weren't done on Exubera.\n\n\"They have done the required safety studies and come out clean, but it's only been tested for six months, so long-term isn't known,\" said Sanjoy Dutta, director of the insulin initiative at the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.\n\nDutta confirmed that Afrezza is fast-acting and less likely to cause low blood sugar. \"Just as quickly as it has an onset of action, it also has a quick off mechanism. It doesn't stay around long enough to cause hypoglycemia,\" he said.\n\nWhile Afrezza looks promising, it can't replace all injections for people with diabetes. Because it's fast-acting, it can't provide the long action of insulin known as basal insulin. It will only replace meal-time insulin.\n\nAfrezza may have an impact on lung function, but Leone-Bay said once people stopped taking Afrezza, this effect went away. The company is conducting clinical trials to assess Afrezza in people with asthma.\n\nLeone-Bay was to explain the Technosphere technology Tuesday at the American Chemical Society annual meeting in San Francisco.

Until recently, 20 to 30 per cent of these patients would develop epilepsy and many need regular antiepileptic treatment. The patients' cognitive performance, life quality and life expectancy is also affected by having the condition.\n\nThe research team has developed and delivered cooling treatment, known as therapeutic hypothermia, for newborns who suffer lack of oxygen during birth. For up to eight years, the researchers followed 165 infants who were born in the south west and who received cooling therapy at St Michael's Hospital, Bristol, part of University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust. The study examined how many babies were diagnosed with epilepsy and how many are on regular antiepileptic drug treatment at two and four to eight years of age.\n\nThe research found that babies, born after 2007, who received the cooling treatment, had much less epilepsy than before cooling treatment was introduced. At two years, seven per cent of the children had an epilepsy diagnosis, however, far fewer, only two per cent, were on regular antiepileptic drugs.\n\nThe study showed that more children had epilepsy when they reached the age of four to eight years with seven per cent on regular medication. However, these are very low numbers needing antiepileptic treatment compared to before cooling treatment was introduced as standard of care.\n\nBefore therapeutic hypothermia was introduced, poor outcome meaning death or moderate or severe disability was around 66 per cent (32 per cent death and 34 per cent surviving with disability).\n\nIn this cohort born after 2007, the number of children with poor outcome is lower at 34 per cent (11 per cent death and 23 per cent survived with disability). Also, the severity of cerebral palsy is milder and seven out of ten are able to walk. Even if a lesser severity of perinatal asphyxia is accounted for, cooling therapy has increased the number of healthy survivors and there are very few children with epilepsy needing drug treatment.\n\nProfessor Marianne Thoresen said: \"Even if we account for a lesser severity of perinatal asphyxia, our research has shown that therapeutic hypothermia reduces the number of children who develop epilepsy later in childhood.

The results will be presented in a poster presentation titled Lung EpiCheck \u2122 - Results of the Training and Test Sets of a Methylation-Based Blood Test for Early Detection of Lung Cancer at the IASLC 19th World Conference on Lung Cancer hosted by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, to take place on September 22-26, 2018 in Toronto, Canada.\n\nIn the study, blood was prospectively collected from 20 centers and 3 biobanks in Europe and Israel. The samples were used for detection of lung cancer with the Lung EpiCheck blood test. Lung EpiCheck was validated on this independent test set comprising 181 lung cancer cases and 141 current or former smoker controls. Results show specificity of 91% and a sensitivity of 74% with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 89%. These results demonstrated similar performance to the preceding training set results from 102 lung cancer cases and 265 current or former smoker controls.\n\nIn particular, in the non-small-cell lung carcinoma group (n=162), the most prevalent type of lung cancer affecting about 85% of lung cancer patients, Lung EpiCheck was able to identify correctly approximately 70% of patients. With a correct identification of 59% of stage I patients, 77% of stage II, 76% of stage III and 83% of stage IV patients.\n\nIn the small cell lung cancer group (n=13), Lung EpiCheck was able to identify correctly 92% of the patients, with a sensitivity of 100% in the limited stage, and 86% at the extensive stage.\n\n\"Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer worldwide due to the high incidence of the disease, and the low rate of diagnosis at early and more curable stages,\" stated Prof. Mina Gaga, the President of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and a lead investigator in the study. \"Clearly, we must establish screening programs for lung cancer worldwide. At the moment, low-dose computerized tomography (LDCT) screening which has been shown to reduce mortality from lung cancer in the very large NLST study is only reimbursed in the US for high-risk individuals. LDCT screening is not reimbursed in Europe or most areas in the world while there is still a debate about its cost and safety. Screening is however necessary in order to identify lung cancer at early, operable, stages for the entire at-risk population so currently, not only CT screening but also methods of molecular screening are being tested. I am therefore very encouraged with the results of this study, showing that EpiCheck has the ability to identify both non-small-cell and small-cell lung cancer at early stages, with a high level of sensitivity and specificity. Such promising results combined with the simplicity of the test, could allow us to detect lung cancer at the early stages and hence improve 5-year survival from about 15% to about 50-70%. This will offer significant added value in the fight against lung cancer.\"\n\n\"We are very excited to present the best published clinically validated results of a blood test for the early detection of lung cancer,\" said Opher Shapira, PhD, CEO of Nucleix. \"Furthermore, these results were validated prospectively in an independent cohort. Currently, early stage lung cancer can be detected either accidentally, when testing for other conditions, or by using low-dose CT scans, which are costly, carry associated risks such as high radiation, and are employed only for a very high-risk population. Early detection of lung cancer can be a game-changer in the fight against this devastating disease, and we are looking forward to begin extensive clinical trials in the US, Europe and China next year, in order to get the test to the market as soon as possible at an affordable price.\"\n\nThe Lung EpiCheck blood test is based on a proprietary molecular biomarker technology, which combines new biochemical assays and sophisticated algorithms. The technology is based on identification and analysis of subtle changes in DNA methylation patterns, a powerful tool for distinguishing between cancer and healthy cells and thus for detection of tumors in the body. Dying tumor cells release cell-free DNA (cfDNA) into the blood, where cancer-specific methylation changes can be detected at any disease stage. The Lung EpiCheck blood test detects changes in DNA methylation in 6 markers in cfDNA associated with lung cancer.\n\nLung cancer is the deadliest and most common of all cancer types. It is estimated that there are about 1.8 million new cases of lung cancer annually worldwide and about 1.55 million die from the disease each year. The reason for the high mortality rate is that currently most cases are detected when the patient becomes symptomatic, which is usually at late stages of the disease. To date, there is no adequate screening process for the early detection of lung cancer, bringing 5-year survival rate to approximately 15%. In addition, there is a well-defined risk group for developing the disease \u2013 mostly smokers and former smokers above the age of 50. In the US, low-dose CT is available for screening of individuals 55-79 years old who smoked at least 1 pack a day for 30 years, which represent less than half of the lung cancer population. Therefore, a screening test aimed at the entire risk group to assist in the early detection of the disease is highly needed and can dramatically increase lung cancer survival.\n\nNucleix Ltd. develops, manufactures and markets innovative, non-invasive, molecular cancer diagnostic tests. Its highly sensitive and specific tests are based on identification of subtle changes in methylation patterns. Nucleix's technology is based on a combination of a new biochemical assay in conjunction with sophisticated algorithms.

The\u00a0release claims that the test will assist with the early detection of lung cancer in people who are seemingly healthy.

Survival was shown to be greatest among those prescribed first-generation nonselective beta-blockers. According to The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center investigators, the drugs block the effects of stress pathways involved in tumor growth and spread. With further research, they may also prove beneficial in conjunction with other treatment regimens and across other cancer types.\n\nPublished today in the journal CANCER, the findings are the result of a multi-institutional retrospective analysis of the medical records of 1,425 women with ovarian cancer treated between 2000 and 2010. Researchers compared overall survival among patients with documented beta-blocker use during chemotherapy and those without. Among the 269 patients who received beta-blockers, 193 (71.7 percent) received beta-1-adrenergic receptor selective agents (SBBs) and the remaining patients received nonselective beta antagonists (NSBBs). The research team found:\n\u2022 For patients receiving any beta-blocker, the median overall survival was 47.8 months versus 42 months for nonusers.\n\u2022 Median overall survival based on beta-blocker receptor selectivity was 94.9 months for those receiving NSBBs versus 38 months for those receiving SBBs.\n\u2022 Even among patients with hypertension, a longer median overall survival was observed among users of NSBBs compared with nonusers (90 months versus 38.2 months).\n\nThis study builds on a large body of research by principal investigator Anil Sood, M.D., professor in Gynecologic Medical Oncology and Cancer Biology at MD Anderson. It showed that stress hormones fuel progression of ovarian and other cancers, and that beta-blockers - among the most proven drugs in cardiovascular medicine - might be a new way to stifle that effect.\n\n\"Beta-blockers treat a variety of conditions, such as heart disease, high-blood pressure, glaucoma and migraines. They target a receptor protein in heart muscle that causes the heart to beat harder and faster when activated by stress hormones,\" Sood said. \"Our research has shown that the same stress mechanisms impact ovarian cancer progression, so these drugs could play a new role in cancer treatment.\"\n\nAccording to Sood, the usefulness of beta-blockers was unclear until now. \"The ability to show improved survival using nonselective agents - which inhibit a specific stress pathway - is the culmination of years of research into ovarian cancer biology and pathogenesis.\"\n\nHe added that beta-blocker users in the study presented at a higher stage of disease, had an increased average BMI and were more likely to be hypertensive. All these factors were associated with decreased survival, yet those who received beta-blockers had either equivalent or improved overall survival. Further examination revealed that NSBB users had improved overall survival regardless of the presence of such prognostic factors or comorbidities. This was not true for patients who took SBBs.\n\nAlthough further study is needed, these results highlight the importance of adrenergic receptor-\u03b22 (ADRB2), a signaling pathway important to ovarian carcinogenesis and targeted by NSBBs (versus the ADRB1 pathway targeted by SBBs).\n\nOvarian cancer is the 5th most deadly cancer among women, accounting for more deaths than any other female reproductive system cancer. An estimated 21,290 new cases are diagnosed, and some 14,180 women die from the disease each year in the U.S., according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nFuture trials will seek to identify patients who would benefit most from beta-blocker use and the best beta-blocker for a specific tumor type based on adrenergic receptor expression. Then they potentially could be used as an adjuvant therapy during surgical recovery and chemotherapy to decrease tumor growth, delays in wound healing and metastasis. Beta-blockers may also reduce cancer-related psychological distress in newly diagnosed patients, according to the study authors.\n\nThere are currently two clinical trials, one led by MD Anderson, evaluating the combination of chemotherapy and propranolol (a type of NSBB) on cancer biology and on stress modulators in patients with newly diagnosed EOC. According to Sood, the preliminary data from these feasibility trials will be used to design prospective, randomized clinical trials examining NSBBs on patient outcomes.\n\n\"The stratification of patients by beta-blocker use and selectivity in this study makes it unique among all other studies examining the impact of these drugs on cancer. It also builds on the mounting evidence that beta-blockers may become a key treatment component for many patients in the future,\" said Sood.\n\nPortions of this study were supported by National Institutes of Health grants (CA140933, CA104825, CA109298, P50CA083639, U54CA151688, U54CA96300, U54CA96297, and CA016672), an Ovarian Cancer Research Fund program Project Development Grant, the Department of Defense (grants OC073399, W81XWJ-10-0158, and OC100237), the Betty Ann Asche Murray Distinguished Professorship, the RGK Foundation, the Gilder Foundation, the Blanton-Davis Ovarian Cancer Research Program, and a Gynecologic Cancer Foundation-St. Louis Ovarian Cancer Awareness grant.

Not only do we save lives, but we reduce the likelihood of needing more aggressive treatment,\" said study author Dr. Elisa Port. She directs the Dubin Breast Center at Mount Sinai and is chief of breast surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital, both in New York City.\n\nCurrently, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that biennial screenings start at age 50 for most women, while the American Cancer Society advises that annual screenings begin at age 45. Earlier guidelines had suggested annual screenings begin at age 40.\n\nPort noted that screening guidelines tend to be based on the ability of mammograms to save lives and how often they give a false positive result.\n\n\"But isn't there some benefit to getting tested earlier, like needing fewer lymph nodes removed and not needing chemotherapy? I think it's safe to say that most women, if they could be assured the same survival, would choose not to get more aggressive therapies,\" she said.\n\nPort's study included more than 1,100 women diagnosed with breast cancer at the Dubin Breast Center. All of the women were older than 40.\n\nThe women were separated into two groups. One group had a mammogram within the 24 months before their breast cancer diagnosis. The other group had a screening 25 months or more before their diagnosis. The second group also included women who had never had a mammogram.\n\nWomen in the second group were 50 percent more likely to need chemotherapy. They were also 32 percent more likely to need surgery to remove the whole breast (mastectomy), and 66 percent more likely to need lymph nodes removed. And the women who were screened earlier had smaller tumors.\n\nPort also looked at the 40- to 49-year-old age group, and found those who had never had a mammogram were much more likely to need chemotherapy. They were also more likely to have larger tumors (by 10 millimeters, on average) and to need a mastectomy than those in the 24 months or less group. But only 29 women fell into the \"never had a mammogram\" group.\n\nHowever, the study did not prove a cause-and-effect link between earlier mammograms and smaller tumors and less aggressive treatment.\n\nAnd Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, noted that this was an observational study that only looked at the experience of one institution.\n\nStill, \"the observations are consistent with what we have seen with the value of early detection.

That may spare the patients from additional testing and additional costs.\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the study, however, experts wrote that using CT scans to gauge bone density could lead to some people being incorrectly diagnosed, particularly if people at low risk are tested.\n\nIn this study, the average age was about 59 years old - six years younger than the age at which the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government-backed panel, recommends all women begin being screened for osteoporosis. The disease affects over 12 million Americans over 50.\n\nThe panel also suggests younger women at an increased risk for bone fractures should be screened, but there\u2019s no recommendation for men of any age.\n\nDespite DXA scans being safe and cost effective, Pickhardt and his colleagues say the test is underused. CT scans, however, are considered overused - with more than 80 million performed in the U.S. during 2011.\n\nFor the new study, the researchers analyzed test results from 1,867 patients, who had both types of scans performed within six months of each other over a 10-year period, to see if their CT scans showed osteoporosis as well as the DXAs.\n\nOverall, about 23 percent of the people were diagnosed with osteoporosis, about 45 percent were diagnosed with some bone-weakening and about 32 percent were healthy based on their DXAs.\n\nThe researchers then found that their ability to accurately diagnose those same patients with osteoporosis from a CT scan depended on what threshold for bone density they used.\n\nDr. Sumit Majumdar, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study, said a lower threshold for bone density would catch most cases of osteoporosis and limit \u201cincidentaloporosis\u201d - incorrect osteoporosis diagnoses \u201cdiscovered\u201d while doctors were looking for something else.\n\nAt the lower threshold, the researchers found 9 percent of those diagnosed with osteoporosis were misdiagnosed.\n\nPickhardt said the screenings would have to target the right groups of people to prevent overdiagnosis.\n\n\u201cObviously it\u2019s something we need to worry about, but if you apply it to a population that\u2019s suitable for diagnosis you wouldn\u2019t run that risk,\u201d he said.\n\nMajumdar, a professor of medicine at the University of Alberta in Canada, said CT scans are better tests, but stomach scans don\u2019t include the hip - like a DXA would.\n\nA DXA can cost a couple hundred dollars, while a CT scan can cost about $500. Both involve radiation.\n\nDr. Beatrice Hull, from the Center for Osteoporosis and Bone Health at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, told Reuters Health that she\u2019d want her patients to have a DXA scan even with a diagnosis from a CT scan.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think at this point this one test is going to prevent further testing.

But new research indicates that such patients, paradoxically, may live longer if they receive a milder chemotherapy drug.\n\nTreatment with the less intensive drug, decitabine, is not a cure. But surprisingly, AML patients whose leukemia cells carried mutations in a nefarious cancer gene called TP53 consistently achieved remission after treatment with decitabine. Their median survival was just over a year.\n\nThe study, by a team of scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, is published Nov. 24 in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nIn AML, treatment involves intensive chemotherapy to try to kill the patient\u2019s leukemia cells and put the cancer into remission. If successful, a follow-up bone-marrow transplant can offer a possible cure, but this course of treatment is recommended only for patients with a high risk of relapse because the procedure can cause severe complications, even death.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really unique here is that all the patients in the study with TP53 mutations had a response to decitabine and achieved an initial remission,\u201d said the study\u2019s senior author, Timothy J. Ley, MD, the Lewis T. and Rosalind B. Apple Professor of Medicine, noting that in AML, TP53 mutations have been correlated with an extremely poor prognosis. \u201cWith standard aggressive chemotherapy, we only see about 20 to 30 percent of these patients achieving remission, which is the critical first step to have a chance to cure patients with additional therapies.\n\n\u201cThe findings need to be validated in a larger trial,\u201d Ley added, \u201cbut they do suggest that TP53 mutations can reliably predict responses to decitabine, potentially prolonging survival in this ultra high-risk group of patients and providing a bridge to transplantation in some patients who might not otherwise be candidates.\u201d\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Elihu Estey, MD, an AML expert at the University of Washington Medical Center and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, noted that AML is not one disease but many, each driven by different genetic mutations. The results of the current trial, he said, point to the inevitable need to replace large cancer clinical trials evaluating homogeneous drug treatments with smaller trials that involve subgroups of patients, with treatments targeted to their specific mutations.\n\nThe current study involved 116 patients treated with decitabine at the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes-Jewish Hospital, and at the University of Chicago. The patients either had AML \u2013 a cancer of the bone marrow \u2013 or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a group of blood cancers that often progresses to AML. This year, an estimated 20,000 people living in the U.S. will be diagnosed with AML, and at least 11,000 deaths will be attributed to the disease.\n\nDecitabine often is given to older patients with AML or MDS because it is less toxic than standard chemotherapies. But fewer than half of patients who get the drug achieve an initial remission, so the researchers wanted to determine whether specific mutations in the patients\u2019 cancer cells could predict their responses to treatment.\n\nTo find out, they sequenced all the genes in patients\u2019 cancer cells or analyzed select cancer genes. They also conducted standard tests to look for broken, missing or rearranged chromosomes. Then, the researchers correlated these molecular markers with treatment response to identify subgroups of patients likely to benefit from decitabine.\n\nAmong the patients in the study, 46 percent achieved a remission with decitabine. But, remarkably, all 21 patients whose leukemia cells carried TP53 mutations went into remission.\n\nPatients also were likely to respond to decitabine if they were deemed to have an \u201cunfavorable risk\u201d prognosis based on extensive chromosomal rearrangements in their cancer cells; many of these patients also had TP53 mutations. Indeed, 66 percent of patients with an unfavorable risk achieved remission, compared with 34 percent of patients who had more favorable prognoses.\n\n\u201cThe challenge with using decitabine has been knowing which patients are most likely to respond,\u201d said co-author Amanda Cashen, MD, an associate professor of medicine who led an earlier clinical trial of decitabine in older patients with AML. \u201cThe value of this study is the comprehensive mutational analysis that helps us figure out which patients are likely to benefit. This information opens the door to using decitabine in a more targeted fashion to treat not just older patients, but also younger patients who carry TP53 mutations.\u201d\n\nFirst author John Welch, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of medicine, added: \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that patients with an extremely poor prognosis in this relatively small study had the same survival outcomes as patients facing a better prognosis, which is encouraging. We don\u2019t yet understand why patients with TP53 mutations consistently respond to decitabine, and more work is needed to understand that phenomenon.\u201d\n\nResponses to decitabine are usually short-lived, however, with remissions typically lasting for about a year. Decitabine does not completely clear all the leukemia cells that carry TP53 mutations, and these cells invariably become resistant to the drug, leading to relapse.\n\n\u201cRemissions with decitabine typically don\u2019t last long, and no one was cured with this drug,\u201d Ley explained. \u201cBut patients who responded to decitabine live longer than what you would expect with aggressive chemotherapy, and that can mean something. Some people live a year or two and with a good quality of life, because the chemotherapy is not too toxic.\u201d\n\nRoughly 10 percent of AML patients carry TP53 mutations in their leukemia cells. Among patients in the study with such mutations, median survival was 12.7 months \u2013 which is not significantly different from the 15.4 months\u2019 survival seen in patients without the mutations \u2013 and is longer than the typical four- to six-month survival observed in such patients treated with more aggressive therapies.\n\nDecitabine was approved by the FDA in 2006 as a treatment for MDS, but oncologists often prescribe it off-label as a treatment for AML, particularly in older patients. AML typically strikes in a person\u2019s mid-60s; the average age of people in the current study was 74.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now planning a larger trial to evaluate decitabine in AML patients of all ages who carry TP53 mutations,\u201d Welch said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to think we may have a therapy that has the potential to improve response rates in this group of high-risk patients.\u201d\n\nThe research is supported by an AML-SPORE grant and the Genomics of AML Program Project grant, both from the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), grant numbers P50 CA171963 and P01 CA101937.\n\nWelch J, Petti A, Miller C, Fronick C, O\u2019Laughlin M, Fulton R, Wilson R, Baty J, Duncavage E, Tandon B, Lee Y-S, Wartman L, Uy G, Ghobadi A, Tomasson M, Pusic I, Romee R, Fehniger T, Stockerl-Goldstein K, Vig R, Oh S, Abboud C, Cashen A, Schroeder M, Jacoby M, Heath S, Luber K, Janke M, Hantel A, Khan N, Sukanova M, Knoebel R, Stock W, Graubert T, Walter M, Westervelt P, Link D, DiPersio J and Ley T.

About 70 percent of the patients were 65 years old or older and about 30 percent were at least 75.\n\nAnd he found that a surprising number of these older patients did quite well. One year after surgery, more people had died from other causes than died from lung cancer. And, after five years, almost 9 out of 10 patients were alive and cancer free.\n\n\"They did well and beat their lung cancer,\" Adusumilli says, proving that when it comes to surgery for early stage lung cancer, age should not be a limiting factor.\n\nThis was the case for Morton Pollner, who is one of Adusumilli's patients. His cancer had not spread, and Adusumilli told him there was a good possibility the cancerous tissue could be completely removed and he could go back to leading a normal life. That was seven years ago. Today, Pollner is 82, cancer free and enjoying life.\n\n\"Whatever I get from here on, it's like gravy,\" he says.\n\nSurgery isn't the answer for all older lung cancer patients, according to Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. Patients with heart or other health problems may not be candidates. At the same time, he says it's important to recognize that patterns of aging have changed over the past two decades.\n\nSeventy today is not the same as it was 20 years ago, Lichtenfeld says. Older adults are more functional, both physically and mentally, than ever before, and he says the medical community needs to adjust its thinking about what treatments older cancer patients can tolerate.\n\n\"We shouldn't allow numerical age to be the deciding factor,\" Lichtenfeld says.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "There is\u00a0only one short paragraph dedicated to quantifying the benefits of surgery, and it\u2019s inaccurate:\n\u201cOne year after surgery, more people had died from other causes than died from lung cancer.

When a small amount of Botox is injected into a muscle, it blocks nerve signals that tell muscles to contract.\n\nAtrial fibrillation (also called AFib or AF) is a quivering or irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) that can lead to blood clots, stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications.\n\n\"About a third of all patients undergoing bypass surgery will develop atrial fibrillation, putting them at higher risk for cardiovascular complications,\" said Jonathan S. Steinberg, M.D., senior study author and Adjunct Professor of Medicine at the University of Rochester and Director of the Arrhythmia Institute in the Valley Health System in Ridgewood, New Jersey. \"Atrial fibrillation is also always associated with lengthened hospitalization and that means increased healthcare costs.\"\n\nIn two Russian hospitals, researchers randomly assigned 60 patients to receive Botox or saline injections. The injections were made in the four major fat pads surrounding the heart. To avoid bias, neither patients nor doctors knew whether the injections contained Botox or saline.\n\u2022 In the 30 days following surgery, those who received Botox injections during heart bypass surgery had a 7 percent chance of developing AF, compared to 30 percent chance in patients who received saline.\n\u2022 One year after surgery, none of the patients who received Botox had AF, compared to 27 percent of the patients who received saline.\n\u2022 No complications from the Botox injections were reported. But complications from the bypass surgery were similar in both groups, including time in intensive care and on a breathing machine, and infection rate.\n\nThe results must be replicated in larger studies before Botox injections are routinely used to prevent AF after bypass surgery, researchers said. If confirmed in heart bypass patients, Botox injections could also help prevent AF in people undergoing valve repair or replacement. About half of those patients will develop AF after surgery.\n\n\"This first-in-man study has opened a whole new line of thinking and research,\" Steinberg said. \"In the near future, botox injections may become the standard of care for heart bypass and valve patients, but we're not quite there yet.\"\n\nCo-authors are Evgeny Pokushalov, M.D.; Boris Kozlov, M.D.; Alexander Romanov, M.D.; Artem Streinikov, M.D.; Sevda Bayramova, M.D.; David Sergeevichev, Ph.D.; Alexander Bogachev-Prokophiev, M.D.; Sergey Zheleznev, M.D.; Vladimir Shipulin, M.D.; Vladimir Lomivorotov, M.D.; Alexander Karaskov, M.D. and Sunny S.

Uslaner is director of In Vivo Pharmacology at Merck & Co., which funded the study.\n\nMerck already has one such drug, suvorexant, under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nMore than 30 million Americans struggle to get a good night's sleep, and about one-third of these use drugs to help the process, the study authors pointed out.\n\nBut widely prescribed sleep medications such as Ambien (zolpidem) and Lunesta (eszopiclone) can leave people feeling hung over and inattentive the next day. So much so that the FDA recently cut recommended doses of Ambien and other drugs that contain zolpidem for fear that their use, even the night before, might impair driving or other activities the next day.\n\nLunesta and Ambien affect GABA receptors, which are found throughout the brain and are associated with side effects, including thinking disturbances, and deficits in attention and memory, explained Uslaner.\n\nAbout 15 years ago, scientists discovered chemical messengers known as orexins, which are released by a relatively small brain region known as the lateral hypothalamus. This area of the brain releases orexins during the day to keep us awake and lowers levels at night so we can sleep.\n\nThe appeal of orexin antagonists, said Dr. Michael Thorpy, director of the Sleep-Wake Disorders Center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, is that they \"target a system that's more specific for sleep.\"\n\nThat means, theoretically, fewer side effects and perhaps less of a tendency to be habit forming, Thorpy explained.\n\nUslaner and his colleagues investigated a compound called DORA-22, which has the same mechanism of action as suvorexant, to see how it fared alongside not only Ambien and Lunesta but also diazepam (Valium) in rats and rhesus monkeys.\n\nDORA-22 did not lead to the same mental impairments as the other three drugs. Rhesus monkeys and rats performed just as well on memory and attention tasks shortly after being administered DORA-22 as they did on an inactive placebo.\n\nIn each case, the minimum dose to achieve sleep was compared with the minimum dose that altered memory and thinking. DORA-22 promoted sleep at lower doses than those that impaired mental skills when compared with the \"control\" drugs.\n\nThis is the first time in years that scientists have targeted a totally different receptor in the quest to combat insomnia, said Dr. Alexandre Abreu, co-director of the UHealth Sleep Center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.\n\nBut many questions remain: Do the drugs truly have fewer side effects? Will they be habit forming? And will they change the quality of sleep in any way?\n\nThose questions will only be answered with more testing and use in humans, he said.\n\nExperts note that findings from animal studies do not always hold up in human trials.\n\nThe U.S. National Institutes of Health has more on insomnia.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The lead sentence is simply wrong.

Since then, clinicians and dermatologists have seen a rise in demand for minimally invasive laser-based treatments, including tattoo removal. However, it is difficult for the laser light, which is held at a distance from the skin, to be perfectly and selectively absorbed by only the targeted birthmark or tattoo. Now, researchers from the University of Missouri have developed instruments that transmit laser light into the tissue through direct contact. The techniques developed by the interdisciplinary team can be used by dermatologists and will reduce safety concerns in laser dermatology by improving laser transmission through surface layers of the skin.\n\nLaser techniques come with risks, including eye damage. Open-air transmission, in which the clinician holds the laser at a distance from the patient, is typical during normal dermatological procedures and presents a hazard to both the patients\u2019 and doctors\u2019 eyes. Paul J.D. Whiteside, a doctoral candidate in the MU Division of Food Systems and Bioengineering, devised a system that will not only improve the process, but will be safer for both clinicians and patients.\n\n\u201cThe system we developed uses ultrasonic pulsation in conjunction with a clinical laser to alter the properties of skin tissues during the procedure,\u201d Whiteside said. \u201cWe\u2019ve named the technique \u2018sonoillumination,\u2019 and we\u2019re hopeful that the procedure will be available widely in the near future.\u201d\n\nWhiteside and his team, including adviser, Heather K. Hunt, an assistant professor of bioengineering in the MU College of Engineering, tested the sonoillumination system on porcine skin tissue samples. Using various amplitudes and pulses, the instruments they developed were tested on the samples and showed great promise for the clinical setting. Whiteside presented his technique to clinicians on April 9, 2017, at the annual conference of American Society for Laser Medicine and Surgery (ASLMS).\n\n\u201cPork skin samples are very close to human skin samples, so the initial results we saw are promising for human applications,\u201d Hunt said. \u201c\u2018Sonoillumination\u2019 will be extremely beneficial for clinicians and the ASLMS presentation allowed us to demonstrate the system to the people who actually will be using the technology once it\u2019s commercialized.\u201d\n\nNicholas Golda, associate professor of dermatology and director of dermatology surgery at the MU School of Medicine, echoed the merits of the sonoillumination system and the effect it will have on dermatology.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to provide patients with safer, more effective treatment options that potentially lower the number of treatments needed,\u201d Golda said. \u201cThis new technology may also provide physicians with a safer, more controllable option for treating patients.\u201d\n\nThe team co-authored the paper, \u201cUltrasonic modulation of tissue optical properties in ex vivo porcine skin to improve transmitted transdermal laser intensity,\u201d which recently was accepted for publication by the society\u2019s journal, Lasers in Surgery and Medicine. The sonoillumination research was funded in part by a 2015 Fast Track grant from the University of Missouri System.\n\nThe team is in the planning stages of developing a start-up company to commercialize the technique.

The drug, from a company called Rigel, is R788 or fostamatinib disodium. The oral drug targets an enzyme called Syk. Nobody is exactly sure of the role Syk plays in rheumatoid arthritis. But there's an overabundance of Syk in the fluid of arthritic joints, and the enzyme is part of the runaway immune machinery that increases joint inflammation.\n\nIn a pilot study, the drug appeared to reduce symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Now Harvard researcher Michael E. Weinblatt, MD, reports results from a phase II clinical trial in which 457 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate treatment received R788 or placebo for six months. For patients treated with the more active twice-daily dose of 100 milligrams of R788:\n\u2022 67% had at least 20% fewer arthritis symptoms, compared to 35% of patients getting a placebo.\n\u2022 43% had at least 50% fewer arthritis symptoms, compared to 19% getting a placebo.\n\u2022 28% had at least 70% fewer arthritis symptoms, compared to 10% getting a placebo.\n\nThe drug does have side effects. Among patients getting the twice-daily 100 milligram dose:\n\u2022 19% had diarrhea, compared to 3% getting a placebo.\n\u2022 14% had upper respiratory infections, compared to 7% getting a placebo.\n\u2022 6% had low white blood cell counts, compared to 1% getting a placebo.\n\u2022 23% had to start or increase blood pressure medication, compared to 7% getting a placebo. There's at least one theoretical concern about R788. Normally, the Syk enzyme helps suppress tumors. Women with breast tumors have low levels of Syk. It's not clear whether long-term use of R788 will increase cancer risk; longer-term clinical trials will have to evaluate this risk. For now, R788 looks very promising, the researchers report. \"Inhibition of the Syk pathway offers a new drug target for rheumatoid arthritis,\" Weinblatt and colleagues conclude.

So, even older patients with limited mobility and balance don\u2019t have to negotiate getting down into a pool.\n\nJohnson starts off recuperating athletes and patients in water somewhere between waist and chest height. The treadmill speed can be set anywhere from 0.3 to 7.1 miles per hour depending on how much resistance a person can handle.\n\n\u201cAt waist height, it\u2019s at about 50 percent of body weight. At chest height, it\u2019s about 30 percent of body weight,\u201d Johnson said, noting, for example, that a person with an injured knee who weighs 100 pounds who is running in waist-high water would only feel like 50 pounds on the bad knee.\n\n\u201cTaking some of that pressure off the knee helps them tolerate that knee injury longer,\u201d said Johnson.\n\nA recent study in the American Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation showed that water workouts might benefit stroke survivors. Researchers asked 21 patients who\u2019d had a stroke within the past two months to undergo two treadmill exercise tests \u2013 one submerged in water and one on a regular treadmill. They gradually increased walking speed and slope over time until the patients couldn\u2019t go any further. Walking on the underwater treadmill produced better measures when it came to maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), a reflection of heart and lung function during exercise, and metabolic equivalents, a measure of energy use.\n\n\u201cThe study proposes a different, very innovative approach\u201d to rehabilitation after stroke, said Dr. Gisele Wolf-Klein, director of geriatric education at Northwell Health in Great Neck, New York.\n\nWolfe-Klein told CBS News she has tried water workouts and said you don\u2019t even feel like you break a sweat even if your heart rate is up. \u201cIt\u2019s a very pleasant way of achieving exactly what you\u2019re trying to do \u2013 allowing a cardio-respiratory response,\u201d Wolfe-Klein told CBS News.\n\nShe noted that medicine\u2019s veterinary counterparts have been using water therapy for years with injured racehorses.\n\nBudd Coates, training director at Runner\u2019s World magazine, said runners don\u2019t just plunge into water\u200b therapy when they\u2019re injured; it\u2019s a great conditioning method for healthy athletes, too. Some recreational swimming pools and homeowners with backyard pools have manual treadmills that are water-safe and can be plunked right in the water.\n\nAn alternative to a water treadmill: Some pool companies will install a water flow system you can work out against.\n\n\u201cIt creates a water force and helps keep you jogging in place,\u201d said Coates.\n\nFor those without access to a water treadmill, you can purchase a foam vest specifically designed for water jogging or use foam barbells to help keep you afloat. Some pools may loan them out, too.\n\nOr, Coates suggested, just try it freeform with waist- or chest-high water to start. If you have trouble getting in out of a recreational pool, look for one that has a slanting beach-style entry into the water, or one with a robotic chair lift. Ask a pool lifeguard or certified swim instructor to help you.\n\nIf running\u2019s not your thing, but the water looks inviting, Coates said there are also spin bikes that can be used underwater.\n\nCoates said the beauty of water running (or even walking) is that it\u2019s great for any age and any level of ability, from elderly stroke survivors to Olympic athletes.\n\nGalen Rupp, the 2016 Rio Olympics\u200b men\u2019s marathon bronze medalist, relies on it as part of his training.\n\n\u201cHe and some of the other guys on the Nike team, it\u2019s well known they take advantage of the anti-gravity treadmill and the aqua track,\u201d Coates said.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story focuses on multiple benefits, none of which are quantified.

Should he get a regular blood test to screen for the disease?\n\nScreening for early detection of cancer sounds like a no-brainer, but it\u2019s not an easy choice for men considering regular P.S.A. tests, which measure blood levels of prostate-specific antigen and are used to detect prostate cancer. Though use of the test is widespread, studies show that the screening saves few, if any, lives.\n\nWhile the test helps find cellular changes in the prostate that meet the technical definition of cancer, they often are so slow-growing that if left alone they will never cause harm. But once cancer is detected, many men, frightened by the diagnosis, opt for aggressive surgical and radiation treatments that do far more damage than their cancers would have, leaving many impotent and incontinent.\n\nAs a result, major health groups don\u2019t advise men one way or the other on regular P.S.A. screenings, saying it should be a choice discussed between a man and his doctor.\n\nSo how does a man decide whether to get P.S.A. screening or not? Finally, some new research offers simple, practical advice \u2014 at least for men 60 and older.\n\nResearchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and Lund University in Sweden have found that a man\u2019s P.S.A. score at the age of 60 can strongly predict his lifetime risk of dying of prostate cancer, according to a new report in the British medical journal BMJ.\n\nThe findings also suggest that at least half of men who are now screened after age 60 don\u2019t need to be, the study authors said.\n\nThe researchers followed 1,167 Swedish men from the time they were 60 years old until they died or reached 85. During that time, there were 43 cases of advanced prostate cancer and 35 deaths in the group. The researchers found that having had a P.S.A. score of 2.0 or higher at the age of 60 was highly predictive of developing advanced prostate cancer, or dying of the disease, within the next 25 years.\n\nAbout one in four men will have a P.S.A. score of 2.0 or higher at the age of 60, and most of them will not develop prostate cancer, said the study\u2019s lead author, Andrew Vickers, associate attending research methodologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering. But the score does put them in a higher-risk group of men who have more to gain from regular screening, he concluded.\n\nThe higher the score at age 60, the greater the long-term risk of dying from prostate cancer, Dr. Vickers and his colleagues found. Men with a score of 2.0 or higher at age 60 were 26 times more likely to eventually die of the disease than 60-year-old men with scores below 1.0.\n\nStill, the absolute risks for men with elevated scores were lower than might be expected. A 60-year-old man with a P.S.A. score just over 2.0 had an individual risk of dying from prostate cancer during the next 25 years of about 6 percent, the researchers found. A 60-year-old man with a P.S.A. score of 5 had about a 17 percent risk.\n\n\u201cMost of those men are going to be absolutely fine,\u201d said Dr. Vickers. \u201cBut they can be told they are at high risk and they need screening.\u201d\n\nMen with a P.S.A. score of 1.0 or lower at age 60 had a very low individual risk of death from prostate cancer over the next 25 years, the study found: just 0.2 percent.\n\n\u201cThey can be reassured that even if they have prostate cancer or get it, it\u2019s unlikely to become life-threatening,\u201d said Dr. Vickers. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong case that they should be exempted from screening.\u201d\n\nThe advice is less clear for men with scores between 1.0 and 2.0 at the age of 60. They still have a very low individual risk of dying from prostate cancer, judging from the new data. The long-term risk of dying from prostate cancer ranged from about 1 percent to 3 percent for these men, and the decision to screen may depend on their personal views and family histories, Dr. Vickers said.\n\nWhile the findings don\u2019t answer all of the questions associated with P.S.A. screening, they should give peace of mind to sizable numbers of men who decide not to continue regular testing. The results also will reassure men who decide to continue with regular screenings that the benefits most likely outweigh the risks.\n\nDr. Eric A. Klein, chairman of the Glickman Urological and Kidney Institute at the Cleveland Clinic, said that he would like to see the findings of the new study independently confirmed, but that other studies also have suggested that the risk of cancer is low in men whose P.S.A. levels remain below 1.5 in their 50s and 60s.\n\n\u201cWe are in the midst of a paradigm shift in screening and risk assessment that no longer relies on a simple P.S.A. cutoff to determine who should be biopsied,\u201d Dr. Klein said.\n\nP.S.A. screening is already not advised for those 75 and older, because the slow-moving nature of the disease means that a vast majority of men at that age are likely to die from something other than a newly detected prostate cancer. A major study last year confirmed that P.S.A. testing is not helpful for men with 10 years or less of life expectancy.\n\nBut the advice continues to be murky for younger men. In a large European study reported last year, 50- to 54-year-olds didn\u2019t benefit from screening. But men ages 55 to 69 who had annual P.S.A. testing were slightly less likely to die from prostate cancer than those who weren\u2019t screened.\n\nThe researchers who conducted the latest study also have investigated whether a man\u2019s P.S.A. score at 50 can predict his long-term risk. In a 2008 report of 21,000 men published in the journal BMC Medicine, the researchers found that two-thirds of the advanced cancer cases that developed over 25 years were in men who had a P.S.A. score of 0.9 or higher at the age of 50.\n\nThose findings can help younger men decide how intensely they want to screen for the disease. A man whose P.S.A. test shows him to be at low risk at age 50 may decide not to be retested again until the age of 60. A man with a higher score may want to do more frequent testing.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t solved every single problem with screening,\u201d Dr. Vickers noted. \u201cWe need to screen fewer people, screen the right people, and we don\u2019t have to treat every cancer we catch.\u201d\n\nA version of this article appeared in print on September 28, 2010, on page D1 of the New York edition of The Times.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "\u00a0The way the study results were reported in this study, 75% of men have a PSA level at age 60 that is less than 2 meaning that their risk of having a problematic prostate cancer in their lifetime is less than 6%. \u00a0\nIt might have been useful to provide some context for evaluating what a 6% risk means. \u00a0How does it compare, for example, of a man\u2019s chance of dying of heart disease? \u00a0Or other types of cancer?", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Sorry.

Currently more than half of people who are treated even at early stages of the disease can expect the cancer to return, and chemotherapy typically leads to only a 5% improvement in people\u2019s chances of living five years \u2014 but an up to 70% chance of being exposed to serious toxicities.\n\nThe studies involve a group of immune-based cancer drugs called checkpoint inhibitors, which are designed to rip away the molecular cloak behind which cancer cells hide from the immune system. The medications target a protein called PD-1, its related PD-L1, or CTLA-4, which protect the body\u2019s cells from being killed by immune cells; because tumors are normal cells growing out of control, they take advantage of this molecular security blanket to avoid getting detected by immune cells. A series of checkpoint inhibitor drugs, first approved in 2011 initially for treating melanoma, expose the tumor cells to the immune system. Based on their success in treating skin cancers, scientists are now studying this group of drugs in a number of other cancers, including tumors in the lung.\n\nIn one study, called CheckMate-227, researchers tested whether a combination of two of these checkpoint inhibitor drugs could keep tumors from growing better than the standard treatment of chemotherapy in people with advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nearly 300 people were randomly assigned to receive either the combination of the immune-based drugs or the traditional chemotherapy treatment. After nearly a year, the lung cancer in people taking the immunotherapy was 42% less likely to have progressed than among people getting chemotherapy.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, say the study\u2019s authors, doctors may also figure out which people are most likely to respond to the two-drug combination of nivolumab (Opdivo) and ipilimumab (Yervoy) and which are not. In the study, he and his colleagues found that people whose tumors had more mutations enjoyed the longest time period during which their cancers did not progress.\n\nCurrently, lung cancer treatments rely heavily on chemotherapy, but doctors are shifting toward a more customized and precise way of treating each person\u2019s disease in order to improve their chances of survival. For example, newer targeted therapy drugs home in on specific genetic mutations that are responsible for driving a person\u2019s cancer. Doctors can also determine if a person\u2019s lung cancer is genetically vulnerable to the checkpoint inhibitor drugs tested in the current study. Putting together everything that doctors currently know about lung tumors, \u201cmore than half of people with lung cancer can avoid chemotherapy and get more precision-based treatments,\u201d says Dr. Matthew Hellmann of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), lead author of the study. In addition, \u201ca year after treatment, three times more people on immunotherapy were doing well compared to those who just got chemotherapy.\u201d\n\nThe results could play a role in changing standard treatments for people diagnosed with advanced NSCLC, by making a strong case for starting people immediately on the immunotherapy combination rather than giving them chemotherapy first, as many doctors currently do. While nivolumab is approved for treating metastatic NSCLC, for example, that indication calls for using it if the disease continues to progress either during or after chemotherapy. This combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab showed that the paired drugs could be more effective when begun as the first treatment, instead of chemotherapy.\n\nThere may also be other ways to improve outcomes for people with advanced NSCLC. In another study, researchers found that combining standard chemotherapy with another immune-based checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab (Keytruda), helped them live nearly four months longer on average than people treated with just chemotherapy. People getting the combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy were 51% less likely to die after 10.5 months than people receiving chemotherapy alone. \u201cThe magnitude of benefit was unexpected and great to see,\u201d says Dr. Leena Gandhi, associate professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and co-author of the study. Pembrolizumab is already approved for treating about 25% to 30% of people with advanced NSCLC who have a certain genetic profile that makes their cancer vulnerable to the drug, but this latest study expands that population to many more people who may benefit from the immunotherapy if the medication is combined with chemotherapy.\n\nThe results are even more encouraging for people with early stage lung cancer. In a third, small study of 21 people diagnosed with early stage disease, researchers led by a team at Johns Hopkins and MSKCC found that giving people two doses of nivolumab before surgery to remove lung tumors shrunk those tumors drastically and lowered chances of relapse, thanks to its ability to jump start the immune system to fight the cancer. When the scientists analyzed the tumors they had cut out, they found that in about half of the people treated with nivolumab, the growths showed significant destruction by immune cells, meaning that nivolumab had unmasked the tumors as foreign and allowed the immune system\u2019s killer cells to attack them. And when the scientists studied the blood of the people receiving the immunotherapy, they discovered a close match between the types of immune cells in the blood and certain targets on the tumor cells, suggesting that nivolumab had released the immune system to pump out the appropriate cells it needed to tackle the cancer.\n\n\u201cWe expected to see some response, but I don\u2019t think we expected to see a 45% significant response,\u201d says Forde. \u201cTo give you some idea of how significant that is, with chemotherapy we normally see the same degree of response around 20% of the time.\u201d\n\nForde says that the strong response seen in people at the beginning of the disease could suggest that immunotherapies might be useful in re-training the immune system to fight cancer for long periods of time \u2014 possibly even a lifetime. \u201cThe Holy Grail is to have a relatively non-toxic therapy that could potentially use the body\u2019s own immune system to prevent recurrence,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd while our study is only with 21 patients, the early indications from this study are very positive.\u201d\n\nTaken together, the results could fundamentally change the way lung cancer is treated, significantly improving people\u2019s ability to both hold off lung cancer for longer periods of time, as well as live longer with the disease.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story doesn\u2019t give absolute data for two of the three studies it mentions.\nIt says the two-drug combination of Opdivo and Yervoy found that after nearly a year, the lung cancer in people taking the immotherapy was \u201c42% less likely to have progressed than among people getting chemotherapy,\u201d and patients taking Keytruda with chemotherapy were \u201c51% less likely to die after 10.5 months\u201d than people getting just chemotherapy.\nAbsolute numbers would have given a clearer picture of what portions of patients saw a benefit.

The journal is published in partnership with Wolters Kluwer.\n\n\"In the absence of treatment alternatives, reverse total shoulder arthroplasty [RTSA] is a justifiable treatment for patients with a massive, irreparable rotator cuff tear before the age of 60,\" according to the report by Christian Gerber, MD, of the University of Zurich and colleagues. Despite a substantial risk of complications, most patients are satisfied with the outcomes of RTSA at follow-ups of a decade or longer.\n\nStable Long-Term Results of RTSA in Patients Younger than 60\n\nThe researchers analyzed the long-term outcomes of RTSA in 20 patients, average age 57 years. All had \"massive, irreparable\" tears of the rotator cuff muscles, causing shoulder \"pseudoparalysis,\"with little no ability to lift the arm.\n\nThis group of patients typically gets limited benefit from shoulder replacement with conventional implants, which rely on the rotator cuff muscles to provide shoulder movement. The RTSA technique--using an implant in which the natural locations of the shoulder \"ball and socket\" are reversed--uses other muscles to move the shoulder, providing an alternative when the rotator cuff is severely damaged or destroyed.\n\nWhen first introduced, RTSA was performed mainly in elderly patients who placed low demands on the shoulder. With refinements in technique and components in more recent years, the procedure has been used in younger, more active patients. But there are concerns about how well the results of RTSA will hold up over time in this group of patients.\n\nThe new study focused on long-term outcomes of RTSA in patients under age 60. The patients underwent follow-up examination between eight and 19 years after surgery (average 11.7 years). Three patients had RTSA in both shoulders, for a total of 23 procedures.\n\nCompared to their preoperative status, most patients had substantial long-term improvement after RTSA. The average Constant score--a standard assessment accounting for shoulder motion, strength, daily activities, and pain--at the time of final-follow-up improved from 24 to 59 (out of a possible 100).\n\nPatients' ratings of \"subjective shoulder value\" improved from 20 percent to 71 percent (compared to 100 percent for a normal shoulder). Shoulder movement and strength increased, while pain decreased. The improvement was similar for patients with and without prior shoulder surgery.\n\nHowever, complications occurred in 39 percent of the shoulders. Further surgery was required in six shoulders; in two cases, the RTSA procedure was considered a failure.\n\nWhen complications occurred, long-term shoulder functioning was not as good but even with the high complication rate, 72 percent of patients rated their satisfaction level as excellent or good.\n\nThe results alleviate concerns that the clinical benefits of RTSA might not hold up over time in younger, more active patients. Despite its high complication rate, Dr. Gerber and colleagues conclude that RTSA \"provides substantial and lasting improvement\" in shoulder function and pain, in a group of patients with limited treatment options.\n\nClick here to read \"Reverse Total Shoulder Arthroplasty for Massive, Irreparable Rotator Cuff Tears Before the Age of 60 Years: Long-Term Results.\"\n\nAbout The Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery\n\nThe Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery (JBJS) has been the most valued source of information for orthopaedic surgeons and researchers for over 125 years and is the gold standard in peer-reviewed scientific information in the field.

But experts said they were optimistic the results will hold up in the larger, longer-term trials already underway.\n\nWhat's most exciting, they said, is that the triple-drug approach could open up new options to nearly all cystic fibrosis patients.\n\n\"This is not a cure for cystic fibrosis,\" stressed Dr. Steven Rowe, who led one of the trials. \"But it could be game-changing.\"\n\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that causes persistent lung infections. Over time, extensive lung damage leads to respiratory failure. At one time, children with CF usually died before they reached school age. But with improved treatments, the typical life expectancy is now about 40 years, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.\n\nCystic fibrosis is caused by various mutations in a gene called CFTR. In the past several years, drugs that target those underlying genetics have become available. Known as CFTR modulators, they were heralded as a major advance in treating the disorder.\n\nHowever, they work well only for a small number of people with certain CFTR mutations, explained Rowe, director of the Cystic Fibrosis Research Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n\nThe most common mutation that causes cystic fibrosis is called F508del -- and it has proven tougher to tackle, Rowe said.\n\nAbout half of people with CF carry two copies of the mutation (one inherited from each parent). For them, a combination of two existing CFTR modulators can ease breathing problems -- but the overall effects are only \"modest,\" Rowe said.\n\nThen there's the 30 percent of CF patients who carry only one copy of F508del, plus another defect known as a \"minimal-function\" mutation. For them, the existing CFTR modulators do not work at all.\n\nBoth new trials focused on those two groups of patients. The results are published in the Oct. 18 New England Journal of Medicine, to coincide with the researchers' presentation at a North American Cystic Fibrosis meeting, in Denver.\n\nRowe's team tested a combination of two available CFTR modulators -- tezacaftor and ivacaftor -- plus an experimental one, known as VX-659.

Now health officials are warning doctors that preventing the disease will take more than just writing a prescription.\n\nThe pill, called Truvada, is already on the market for treating HIV infections. But the landmark study, involving 2,500 men who have sex with men, showed that taking Truvada faithfully can reduce the risk of infection by as much as 92 percent.\n\nThat touched off a lot of celebrating. It's the first time anybody's shown that taking a pill can prevent HIV \u2013 and it was the first new weapon against HIV unveiled in many years.\n\nTo make sure it works, though, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says doctors need to do a number of things:\n\u2022 Prescribe Truvada only for men at high risk of getting infected \u2013 that is, only for men who have sex with men, those who have multiple sex partners, and those who live in areas where there's a lot of HIV circulating.\n\u2022 Test patients before prescribing it to make sure they're not already infected. That'll help avoid creating viruses resistant to the drug when patients miss doses. For the same reason, patients should get an HIV test periodically while on the drug.\n\u2022 Counsel patients on Truvada to use condoms faithfully, because the drug isn't a sure bet against the virus.\n\u2022 Above all, tell patients they must take the drug every day \u2013 not just when they've had risky sex.\n\nThe study makes that last point very clear. Overall, men who took Truvada had a 44 percent lower risk of HIV infection. But those who said they took the drug at least 9 out of every 10 day had a 73 percent lower risk.\n\nThat doesn't tell the whole story. When researchers tested the blood of patients for traces of Truvada, they found many who claimed to have taken the pill regularly weren't telling the truth. Among those whose tests showed they really did take it every day, the risk of HIV infection was 92 percent lower than those not on the drug.\n\nThere's one other thing, the CDC says.

According to a network meta-analysis research article published in the May 1, 2018 issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (JAAOS), the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) naproxen was ranked most effective in individual knee OA treatment for improving both pain and function, and is considered a relatively safe and low-cost treatment method.\n\nNonsurgical treatments for knee OA supported by previous research evidence include strength training, low-impact aerobic exercises, NSAIDs, and weight loss in individuals with a body mass index over 25. This new research analyzed data from multiple trials to determine the relative effectiveness of various nonsurgical treatments for knee OA. The treatments that were compared and ranked included acetaminophen; ibuprofen; intra-articular (IA) or joint injections of cortisone; platelet-rich plasma (PRP); hyaluronic acid (HA); several NSAIDs, such as naproxen, celecoxib, and diclofenac; and both oral and IA placebo.\n\n\"This is the first comprehensive mixed-comparison analysis comparing best-evidence scientific research and excluding lower quality studies that can bias the outcomes,\" said lead author and orthopaedic surgeon David Jevsevar, MD, MBA. \"Using a statistical ranking technique, we worked to provide evidence regarding which of the most common NSAIDs are most likely to decrease pain and improve function, and we attempted to fill in the gaps in evidence for more inconclusive treatments such as HA, PRP, and corticosteroids.\"\n\nAuthors analyzed 53 randomized controlled trials that examined knee OA treatments for at least 28 days and included a minimum of 30 participants per study group. Knee OA treatments were ranked on a scale of one to five, with one being the most effective. They found the following:\n\u2022 For pain reduction, cortisone injections provided the greatest short-term (4 to 6 weeks) pain relief, followed by ibuprofen, PRP injections, naproxen, and celecoxib.\n\u2022 Naproxen ranked the highest for probability for improving function, followed by diclofenac, celecoxib, ibuprofen, and PRP injections.\n\u2022 Naproxen was ranked the most effective individual knee OA treatment for improving both pain and function followed by cortisone injections, PRP injections, ibuprofen and celecoxib.\n\u2022 HA injections did not achieve a rank in the top five treatments for pain, function, or combined pain and function. An analysis of 12 articles also found that results with HA are not significantly different from those with IA placebo for treatment of knee OA.\n\n\"Because knee OA has both a high disease burden and high treatment costs, additional prospective studies using similar outcomes, timelines, and measures of clinically important changes are needed,\" explained Dr. Jevsevar. \"While the information in this analysis is helpful to physicians, patients also can benefit from these findings and use it with their doctors to weigh all possible treatment options.\"\n\nAlthough the use of NSAIDs for arthritic conditions such as knee OA has potential risks, including heart attack and stroke, existing evidence indicates that naproxen has less potential for adverse cardiovascular events.\n\nMore information about the AAOS and JAAOS\n\nFollow the AAOS on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram \n\nFollow the conversation about JAAOS on Twitter\n\nFrom the Department of Orthopaedics, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH (Dr. Jevsevar), American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, Rosemont, IL (Mr. Shores, Mr. Mullen, Ms. Schulte, and Dr. Cummins), and Franciscan Orthopedic Associates, Tacoma, WA (Dr. Brown).

Is an app-based self-care program particularly attractive to young women? These questions addressed in a new study by researchers from Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, the results of which have been published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology*.\n\nApproximately 50 to 90 percent of young women experience pain during their periods. While this pain primarily manifests itself as lower abdominal cramping, other symptoms include headache, backache, nausea and diarrhea. Acupressure is a technique derived from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). In contrast to acupuncture, this technique can be used as a form of self-care and is suitable for use at home. Rather than using needles, this technique involves massage or pressure being applied to specific points on the body.\n\nThe researchers wanted to evaluate whether in a group of women suffering from severe menstrual pain, aged between 18 and 34, self-acupressure would be more effective at achieving a sustained reduction in menstrual pain than usual care alone (e.g. pain medication and hormonal contraceptives). A total of 221 participants were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups, both of which received a study app and short introduction. Acupressure-based features - with instructions on how to administer self-acupressure shortly before and during menstruation - were only made available to the intervention group. One advantage of an app-based intervention is its ability to provide visual descriptions of the pressure points users need to target in order to achieve the desired effect. It can also send regular reminders. Additionally, the app was used to collect all study-related data.\n\n\"Initially, we simply wanted to conduct a study on the use of self-care techniques for menstrual pain. However, the women who were involved during the planning stages, all of whom were affected by menstrual pain, wanted an app,\" reports the study's principal investigator, Prof. Dr. Claudia Witt of the Institute of Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics. The app helped participants to apply simple self-acupressure techniques to three different acupressure points.\n\nAfter three months, 37 percent of participants in the acupressure group reported a 50 percent reduction in pain intensity. After six months, this proportion had increased to more than half of the women in this group (58 percent). Only 25 percent of women in the control group reported a similar reduction in pain intensity at both the 3-month and 6-month marks. Women in the acupressure group also used less pain medication than women in the control group and reported lower levels of pain overall.\n\n\"We were surprised to see that, after six months, two thirds of participants continued to use self-acupressure. So far, research into the clinical effectiveness of apps has been limited, and only a few have been tested using randomized controlled trials,\" says Dr. Daniel Pach of the Institute of Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics. He adds: \"We were able to show that apps can be evaluated in a clinical trial setting.

Oral Nsaids can be toxic to the kidneys, and they increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Aside from the possible risks to people with other illnesses, the drugs are not helpful for patients with pain throughout the body, like fibromyalgia, and should not be used along with oral Nsaids.\n\nNor are they recommended for stress fractures or tendon tears, because anti-inflammatory drugs in general have been shown to slow healing of tendons and bones.\n\nAnd young, healthy patients may not want to bother with creams or gels, which have their maximum effect if applied four times a day. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to pop a pill,\u201d Dr. Altman said.\n\nBut for immediate relief of my tennis-related muscle pull, the cream was handy and helpful.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "1clip_filelist.xml\"/>\n\n\n\nAlthough the story explains the available evidence comparing topical NSAIDs to oral pain relievers, highlights the limited number of direct comparisons, and carefully states the general consensus of experts, all of this solid reporting is undermined by a focus on personal anecdotal evidence over quantifiable benefits.

Hall felt nothing from the seconds-long bursts from 1,024 ultrasound beams aimed at different points around her skull, and an MRI scan confirmed that the brain barrier was successfully traversed.\n\nThe microscopic bubbles \u2014 roughly the size of red blood cells \u2014 had previously been injected into a vein, along with a chemotherapy drug called liposomal doxorubicin and a tracing molecule.\n\nOn Friday, as scheduled, Hall had brain surgery to remove her tumor. No damage from the ultrasound was visible inside her brain, Mainprize said, and she is recovering well from the surgery.\n\nBecause the trial was designed solely to determine the safety of focused ultrasound to the brain, the patient was not given a therapeutic dose of doxorubicin and the procedure is not expected to help in her recovery, Mainprize said. In the trial at Sunnybrook \u2014 funded by the Virginia-based Focused Ultrasound Foundation \u2014 nine others are slated to receive the same procedure.\n\nSucceeding in getting drugs across the barrier is \u201ca huge achievement\u201d said Dr. Nathan McDannold, a radiologist at Boston\u2019s Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, who has been working to open the barrier with ultrasound since he first accomplished the feat 15 years ago in animals.\n\nBut it\u2019s just one of many. New, safe doses of drugs will need to be determined, once medication is not being diverted by the blood-brain barrier, noted Dr. Gordon Li, a neurosurgeon at Stanford. \u201cIf we feel like we have a safe method of getting drugs in there,\u201d he said, \u201cit will open up a whole new slew of clinical trials.\u201d\n\nMainprize said the patient, a \u201cremarkable woman,\u201d was chosen to go first, because of the status and large size of her tumor, because it was an area of the brain that the ultrasound machinery could easily reach, and because of her willingness to help the research.\n\nIn a prepared video, Hall said she just wants to get back to living her life. \u201cI want to be a normal housewife \u2026 a normal grandma.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Since this is a single patient there is no quantification involved, so N/A.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "\n\u2022 People who have had Type 2 diabetes for up to 10 years can reverse their condition\n\nA new study from Newcastle University has shown that people who reverse their diabetes and then keep their weight down remain free of diabetes.\n\nIn addition, the team found that even patients who have had Type 2 diabetes for up to 10 years can reverse their condition.\n\nThe study, published today in Diabetes Care, is the latest research from world-renowned Professor Roy Taylor, Professor of Medicine and Metabolism at Newcastle University, who also works within Newcastle Hospitals.\n\nThe research is part of a growing body of evidence showing that people with Type 2 diabetes who successfully lose weight can reverse their condition because fat is removed from their pancreas, returning insulin production to normal.\n\nA previous study led by Professor Taylor, published in 2011, showed that diabetes could be reversed by a very low calorie diet. This caused international interest, but the study was very short as it was only eight weeks and the question remained whether the diabetes would stay away.\n\nIn this new study, 30 volunteers with Type 2 diabetes embarked on the same diet of 600 to 700 calories a day. Participants lost on average 14 kilograms - just over 2 stone. Over the next 6 months they did not regain any weight.\n\nThe group included many people with longer duration diabetes, defined as more than 8 years and ranging up to 23 years.\n\nOverall, 12 patients who had had diabetes for less than 10 years reversed their condition. 6 months later they remained diabetes free. In fact, after 6 months a thirteenth patient had reversed their diabetes.\n\nThough the volunteers lost weight they remained overweight or obese but they had lost enough weight to remove the fat out of the pancreas and allow normal insulin production.\n\nProfessor Roy Taylor said: \"What we have shown is that it is possible to reverse your diabetes, even if you have had the condition for a long time, up to around 10 years. If you have had the diagnosis for longer than that, then don't give up hope - major improvement in blood sugar control is possible.\n\n\"The study also answered the question that people often ask me - if I lose the weight and keep the weight off, will I stay free of diabetes? The simple answer is yes!\n\n\"Interestingly, even though all our volunteers remained obese or overweight, the fat did not drift back to clog up the pancreas.\n\n\"This supports our theory of a Personal Fat Threshold. If a person gains more weight than they personally can tolerate, then diabetes is triggered, but if they then lose that amount of weight then they go back to normal.\n\n\"Individuals vary in how much weight they can carry without it seeming to affect their metabolism - don't forget that 70% of severely obese people do not have diabetes.\n\n\"The bottom line is that if a person really wants to get rid of their Type 2 diabetes, they can lose weight, keep it off and return to normal.\n\n\"This is good news for people who are very motivated to get rid of their diabetes. But it is too early to regard this as suitable for everyone. That is a separate question and a major study is underway to answer this.\"\n\nParticipants in this study had Type 2 diabetes for between six months and 23 years. The team showed that Type 2 diabetes could be reversed even in people who had the condition for 10 years.\n\nThe team were able to identify in advance participants who would not respond to adequate weight loss by reversing their diabetes as at the start they had almost absent insulin production from the pancreas.\n\nThe study was funded by a National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre (NIHR BRC) grant.\n\nA larger trial involving 280 patients is already underway. This will examine how successfully people can reverse their diabetes through weight loss simply under the care of their family doctor and nurse. It is being funded by Diabetes UK.\n\nThe research was possible through Newcastle Academic Health Partners, a collaboration involving Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust and Newcastle University. This partnership harnesses world-class expertise to ensure patients benefit sooner from new treatments, diagnostics and prevention strategies.\n\u2022 3 diet shakes per day and 240 grams of non-starchy vegetables taking in between 600 and 700kcal a day for 8 weeks\n\u2022 volunteers then gradually returned to eating normal food over the next two weeks with very careful instruction on how much to eat\n\u2022 volunteers were seen once a month and supported with an individualized weight maintenance programme over the next 6 months\n\u2022 to keep weight steady after the weight loss, they were eating around one third less than before the study\n\nAllan Tutty, 57, from Sunderland, transformed his health by taking part in the study.\n\nHe said: \"I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes around May 2011 during routine checks by my GP but my family and I were in disbelief because I had no physical symptoms which led me to consider I had the condition.\n\n\"While I didn't feel fat, I was fat - on the inside. I've since seen a scan of my liver and you can see the fat around it.\n\n\"I took part in the research spending eight weeks on an 800-calorie a day diet which was really tough over Christmas and New Year but I was determined to complete it. The pay-off for me - the possible reversal of my diabetes - was more than worth the effort.\n\n\"In the two months, I lost two and a half stones and my pancreas was working within normal limits. With my diabetes in remission, I haven't looked back.\n\n\"I eat normal foods though I eat less than I used to, and I enjoy takeaways and chocolate but not on a regular basis so I have maintained my lower weight, it has been a total lifestyle change.

By introducing the immune system to a potential future enemy, antibodies against that invader are ready to attack when the time comes. In this case, the vaccine introduces a piece of the heroin molecule to the immune system. In response, this protective system manufactures antibodies to the drug, including the components that cause the high.\n\nAs a result, those molecules never reach the brain, preventing the euphoria that may have otherwise resulted. The absence of a high could help recovering heroin users resist the temptation to relapse, the researchers say.\n\nThe current study of the vaccine, published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, follows eight years of laboratory research and studies in rodents that indicated the compound could neutralize heroin at different doses.\n\nHere, the Scripps investigators, working with researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University, tested the vaccine on four rhesus monkeys. The animals were given three doses of the vaccine, which elicited a successful immune response that neutralized heroin given at varying doses. The high-blocking effects of the vaccine were strongest during the first month but continued for more than eight months. The researchers did not observe any harmful side effects from the intervention.\n\nRelated: Opioid epidemic and overdose deaths blamed on pharma in Ohio lawsuit\n\nTwo of the animals had been exposed to the vaccine seven months before for a similar pilot study.

(Vanda) (NASDAQ: VNDA) today announced that HETLIOZ\u00ae, a circadian regulator, demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful benefits in nighttime and daytime symptoms of jet lag disorder. HETLIOZ\u00ae is currently approved in the US and Europe for the treatment of Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder, a rare and chronic circadian rhythm sleep disorder.\n\nJet lag disorder is a common circadian disorder frequently observed in millions of travelers who cross multiple time zones. Jet lag disorder is characterized by nighttime sleep disruption, a decrease in daytime alertness and impairment to social and occupational functioning.\n\nThe clinical efficacy results reported today are from the JET8 Phase-III clinical study (3107) (the JET8 study). In the JET8 study, 318 healthy volunteers were admitted to a sleep unit and were subjected to a circadian challenge of an 8 hours advance to their usual bedtime. The JET8 study design induced the circadian challenge experienced by travelers who cross 8 times zones, which leads to jet lag disorder. This clinical design allowed for the study of HETLIOZ\u00ae without the confounding effects of sleep deprivation and variable light conditions.\n\nResults from the JET8 study showed significant and clinically meaningful effects of HETLIOZ\u00ae 20 mg on the primary endpoint of the study as well as multiple secondary endpoints. The pre-specified primary endpoint was the amount of sleep time in the first two thirds of the night. Secondary endpoints included measures of sleep parameters (TST, LPS, WASO) and next day alertness (KSS and VAS). (Table 1).\n\nThe results of the JET8 study shown above demonstrate the effectiveness of HETLIOZ\u00ae in treating jet lag disorder. The magnitude of the total sleep time benefit of 85 minutes improvement over placebo is significant and clinically meaningful. The demonstration of benefits in measurements of next day alertness on both KSS and VAS is meaningful and it underscores the ability of HETLIOZ\u00ae to address both nighttime and daytime symptoms of jet lag disorder.\n\nVanda previously reported on the JET5 study (3101) that examined the effects of HETLIOZ\u00ae in a circadian challenge of 5 hours advance of the subjects' usual bedtime. The results of that study were published in The Lancet in 2009.1 The observation that HETLIOZ\u00ae is effective in treating the symptoms caused by an abrupt advance of the circadian cycle of a magnitude of 5 or 8 hours suggests that HETLIOZ\u00ae will be an effective therapeutic tool in the treatment of individuals that experience symptoms of jet lag. HETLIOZ\u00ae will be potentially useful under circumstances of rapid eastward transmeridian travel experienced by frequent travelers, the rapid deployment of military troops and any circumstances that will necessitate the abrupt phase advance of the sleep wake cycle.\n\nJet lag disorder affects millions of individuals annually who cross multiple time zones during their travel. Jet lag disorder symptoms are more severe during eastward travel. It is reported that more than 30 million US residents make trips abroad each year to overseas destinations. Of these, 60% (approximately 20 million) travel to destinations in Europe, Middle East and Asia. It is also reported that 8% (approximately 1.6 million) travel in Business or First class.2\n\n\"We are extremely pleased with the outcome of this study which establishes the utility of HETLIOZ\u00ae in the treatment of jet lag disorder as HETLIOZ\u00ae was shown to overcome a significant circadian challenge of an 8 hour phase advance. This challenge is equivalent to eastward travel across 8 time zones as experienced for example on travel from Los Angeles to London, Washington DC to Moscow, Paris to Tokyo, or London to Singapore. HETLIOZ\u00ae improved both nighttime sleep and next day alertness potentially offering significant benefits to millions of travelers,\" said Mihael H.

Robotic nephrectomy for inferior vena cava tumor thrombus has favorable outcomes in selected patients compared with open surgery, which can have a high rate of complications, report surgeons in The Journal of Urology\u00ae.\n\nRenal vein surgery can often be managed with minimally invasive laparoscopic techniques, but this is not typically advisable for an IVC thrombus (a fibrous clot), which is surgically far more complex with potentially fatal complications that can occur in the course of removing the thrombus and reconstructing the IVC.\n\nThe first known procedure using robotic surgery of renal tumors with IVC tumor thrombi was performed in 2008. Experts from nine leading U.S. medical centers report here on their combined experience of 32 cases since 2008. Each surgeon performed between one and ten procedures for IVC tumor thrombi which ranged from one to 11 cm in length on preoperative imaging. Patient age ranged from 43 to 80 years.\n\nThe IVC required cross-clamping in 24 cases. One patient had two renal veins with two caval thrombi and one patient required a synthetic patch. Surgeries lasted from three to seven hours. None of the operations was converted to open surgery and all but two patients were ambulatory on the day of or day after surgery. Twenty-one patients resumed regular diets the day after surgery. Eight patients had node positive disease and seven patients had distant recurrence 15 months later including four of those with node positive disease.\n\n\"This is a complex condition and the complication rate with open surgery is 12% to 47%, depending on the thrombus level, with a mortality rate of 5% to 10%,\" explained lead investigator Ronney Abaza, MD, Robotic Surgery Director at OhioHealth Dublin Methodist Hospital. \"Using robotic nephrectomy, our complication rate and lack of mortalities compare reasonably with open series with no grade III to V complications, according to the Clavien system, in any patient, including no deaths.\"\n\nDr Abaza added, \"While complications were relatively minor in our series, it is evident that complications are not entirely avoidable.

Here\u2019s the actual data from the study:\n\u201cIntraoperative complications occurred in only 1 patient who had a bowel injury during access that\u00a0was repaired primarily. Postoperative complications\u00a0occurred in 7 other patients, and included shortness\u00a0of breath, pneumonia,\u00a0pulmonary embolism, ileus and emergency room\u00a0visit for cardiac complaints in 1 patient each, as well\u00a0as temporary renal impairment not requiring dialysis\u00a0in 2 patients.\u201d\nThe director of robotic surgery quoted described the\u00a0complications in his series as \u201crelatively minor,\u201d but does not specify what he means.

Botulinum toxin type A is sold under different brands, but it\u2019s best known by the Allergan brand-name Botox.\n\nBotox gained fame for smoothing aging skin \u2014 by blocking nerve signals and relaxing muscles under the skin \u2014 but the product has a number of medical uses. In the U.S., Botox is approved to treat conditions like chronic migraine, excessive sweating and certain symptoms of MS: overactive bladder and muscles spasms in the arms.\n\nThe new study, published in the journal Neurology, tested the effects of Botox injections on MS-related arm tremors, which affect up to two-thirds of people with MS. Researchers found that when they gave injections to 23 patients, the treatment typically eased their tremors and improved their writing ability.\n\nRight now, there\u2019s no good way to treat MS arm tremors, said Nicholas G. LaRocca, vice-president of healthcare delivery and policy research at the National MS Society. Physical therapy and exercise have been studied, but are usually not very effective, said LaRocca, who was not involved in the new study. Surgery is sometimes used in severe cases, but it\u2019s risky and may not even have lasting benefits.\n\n\u201cExploring new treatments is important, and it\u2019s heartening to see there\u2019s some promise here,\u201d LaRocca said of the current findings. But there\u2019s still a lot to be learned, he cautioned in an interview.\n\n\u201cThis study is fairly preliminary, and it had a small number of patients,\u201d LaRocca said. Larger studies, of more-diverse groups of MS patients, are needed, he said.\n\nThe study\u2019s lead researcher agreed on the need for more work. \u201cThere are several questions that need to be answered by doing larger and longer-term studies,\u201d Dr. Anneke van der Walt, a neurologist at Royal Melbourne Hospital in Australia, said in an email.\n\nOne is how long the benefits of repeat Botox injections might last: this study tested the effects of just one Botox treatment over three months.\n\nIn real life, the injections would have to be repeated every few months, or possibly every six months for some people, according to van der Walt. Another question is whether the side effects change over time. Muscle weakness was the most common side effect in this study, van der Walt said. It affected 42 percent of the study patients, though it went away within two weeks.\n\nMuscle weakness is a potential concern in MS patients, LaRocca noted, since that problem often comes with the disease itself.\n\nThe study included 23 MS patients with mild to moderate arm tremors. Each patient received a round of Botox injections and a round of placebo injections (containing saline), three months apart. Half of the patients got the Botox first, the other half the placebo.\n\nOn average, the patients\u2019 tremor \u201cscores\u201d had gone from a 5 to a 3 six weeks after Botox treatment \u2014 which essentially means moving from \u201cmoderate\u201d to \u201cmild,\u201d LaRocca said. Their ability to write and draw a straight line had also improved by week six, and the benefits were still there at week 12.\n\nIn contrast, there were no improvements after the placebo injections.\n\nLarger studies, van der Walt said, should look at whether Botox is more effective for some tremors than others. Tremors limited to the hand and forearm, for instance, might respond better than tremors that also affect the shoulder. If Botox is eventually approved for this MS symptom, LaRocca said it will be important for doctors to get training in how to give the injections \u2014 since the drug has to go into carefully chosen locations in the muscle.\n\n\u201cSo practitioners will have to be up to speed,\u201d LaRocca said. There will also be the matter of cost. That will vary from patient to patient, depending on how many injections are needed per treatment.\n\nAccording to van der Walt, the cost could range from $500 to $1,000 Australian dollars, which are roughly equal to U.S. dollars. In the U.S., Botox treatments can cost $455-$575 per injection site.\n\nBotox maker Allergan supplied the product for the study, and two of the researchers on the work have financial ties to the company.

Just under a third of women taking flibanserin got over their sexual distress and/or lack of sexual desire (vs. about a fifth of women taking placebo pills). But the difference was important to the women, says study researcher Michael L.

It is known that monounsaturated fats can help lower levels of bad cholesterol, reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\nFor their study, Kris-Etherton and colleagues set out to assess how avocado consumption - by replacing saturated fatty acids, or \"bad\" fats - affected risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases.\n\nThe team recruited 45 healthy participants aged 21-70 years who were either obese or overweight.\n\nEvery participant was required to follow each of three cholesterol-lowering diets for 5 weeks. The diets consisted of a lower-fat diet without avocado, a moderate-fat diet without avocado or a moderate-fat diet with one Hass avocado a day.\n\nPrior to starting each diet, subjects ate what the researchers deem an \"average American diet,\" which was made up of 34% of calories from fat, 16% from protein, while around half of calories were from carbohydrates.\n\nFrom both of the moderate-fat diets, participants gained 34% of calories from fat, of which 17% were from monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). The lower-fat diet provided participants with 24% of calories from fat, of which 11% was from MUFAs.\n\nModerate-fat diet with one avocado a day lowered 'bad' cholesterol by 13.5 mg/dL\n\nThe researchers found that participants' levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) - referred to as the \"bad\" cholesterol - were an average of 8.3 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) lower after following the lower-fat diet without an avocado and 7.4 mg/dL lower after following the moderate-fat diet without an avocado, compared with their baseline average.\n\nHowever, after participants followed the moderate-fat diet with one avocado a day, their LDL levels were found to be an average of 13.5 mg/dL lower than their baseline average.\n\nWhat is more, the team found that a number of additional blood measurements - such as total cholesterol, small dense LDL, triglycerides and non-HDL (high-density lipoprotein) - were better after participants followed the moderate-fat diet with one avocado a day, compared with the other two diets.\n\nAlthough these findings demonstrate that an avocado a day alongside a moderate-fat diet has the potential to reduce bad cholesterol, the team notes that their research was a controlled feeding study. \"That is not the real-world,\" says Kris-Etherton, \"so it is a proof-of-concept investigation.\"\n\nStill, the team believes their findings indicate that people should consider replacing saturated fatty acids in their diet with healthier fats from avocados and other sources. Kris-Etherton adds:\n\n\"We need to focus on getting people to eat a heart-healthy diet that includes avocados and other nutrient-rich food sources of better fats. In the United States avocados are not a mainstream food yet, and they can be expensive, especially at certain times of the year. Also, most people do not really know how to incorporate them in their diet except for making guacamole. But guacamole is typically eaten with corn chips, which are high in calories and sodium. Avocados, however, can also be eaten with salads, vegetables, sandwiches, lean protein foods (like chicken or fish) or even whole.\"\n\nIt should be noted that this research was supported by the Hass Avocado Board, but the researchers say the organization played no other role in the study.\n\nIn January 2014, Medical News Today reported on a study suggesting that consuming half an avocado with lunch each day may satisfy hunger in overweight individuals and help with weight management.\n\nOur Knowledge Center article on the health benefits of avocado reveals some of the other ways the food may be good for us, as well as the potential risks of avocado consumption.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The reduction in LDL or \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol levels are clearly stated for each study group referenced in the article.

Some look for proteins in the blood that appear with cancer. Others more recently have focused on DNA from tumors. But these methods alone don't give reliable results.\n\nSo Nickolas Papadopoulos, a professor of oncology and pathology at the Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, collaborated with many colleagues at the medical school to develop a new approach. It combines two methods into one test.\n\nTheir experimental test, dubbed CancerSEEK, focuses on eight major cancers: lung, breast, colon, pancreas, liver, stomach, ovary and esophagus.\n\n\"We selected those eight cancers based on how frequent they are, also [because] a lot of them do not have any screening modality right now,\" Papadopoulos says.\n\nThe researchers looked at 1,005 people who had been diagnosed with these cancers. The blood test found signs of cancer in about 70 percent of them.\n\nThey also looked at 812 people without cancer diagnoses and found just seven of them \u2014 less than 1 percent \u2014 apparently had a false reading that found cancer. A low false-positive rate is critical for any test that could be used widely to screen people for cancer.\n\nOf course, the ultimate goal of this test is to find cancer in people who haven't already been diagnosed. And that percentage could well be lower than the 70 percent average. For example, the test was successful only about 40 percent of the time in the patients the researchers studied with the earliest stage 1 cancers.\n\nThough 40 percent success would be far from ideal, \"we still think this is a very important milestone in detecting cancers in asymptomatic people,\" Papadopoulos says. \"That could save their life.\"\n\n\"I am incredibly excited by this new paper,\" says Joshua Schiffman, an oncologist and cancer researcher at the Huntsman Cancer Center at the University of Utah who was not involved in the study. \"This is the paper that's going to set the field in motion.\"\n\nBut Schiffman points out that there are many issues to work out \u2013 even assuming the test proves reliable among people who have not been previously diagnosed with cancer. For instance, if the success rate is around 40 percent at detecting cancer, that means it misses cancers more often than it finds it.\n\n\"The thing we worry about quite often is ... if we have a test result that is negative we don't want to give false reassurance to the patient,\" he says. He is concerned that patients will think to themselves, \"Even though I have this weird stomach pain that won't go away, I know it's not cancer. I'm not going to go to the doctor because the CancerSEEK test told me it was negative,\" Schiffman says. \"And that would be a terrible thing.\"\n\nAnother problem is that the test results find signs of cancer, but often fail to pinpoint which part of the body is affected. \"That's a tremendous problem that has to be overcome,\" he says.\n\n\"We've come about one step in a thousand-mile journey,\" says Vinay Prasad, an oncologist and cancer researcher at the Oregon Health and Science University who was not involved in the study.\n\nFirst, he notes, the Hopkins team will need to demonstrate that the test will be useful in patients without symptoms. Then the researchers will need to show that the rate of false alarms remains very low, otherwise people will be sent on needless and expensive medical odysseys.\n\nAnd for the test to be useful, \"you've got to find cancer that's going to otherwise be lethal, and not cancer that would otherwise be destined to do nothing,\" Prasad says.\n\nThat's been a huge problem with previous cancer screening tests, especially for prostate cancer and breast cancer, and has led to pointless and potentially dangerous treatments, he says.\n\nAn effective screening test would hold lots of potential for cancer patients, Prasad says.\n\n\"We want this to be true, we hope that this is true, but we have learned through 30, 40, 50 years of cancer screening that we have to do the right studies at the outset to know that it's true,\" Prasad says.\n\nThe scientists at Hopkins have already launched their next study, which could involve tens of thousands of apparently healthy volunteers who are enrolled in the Geisinger Health Plan in Pennsylvania. Their experience will help answer the next big question, which is whether CancerSEEK will pick up cancer in people who don't have symptoms.\n\nIf that multiyear experiment succeeds, the researchers will still have to demonstrate that the test improves and extends the lives of cancer patients.\n\nPapadopoulos is less concerned that the test could detect cancers that might not in fact benefit from treatment.\n\n\"In a personal level, I do want to know,\" he says. \"That doesn't mean I have to go and have a surgery. However, I still think this is very useful information, knowing that something is happening and follow it up.\"\n\nAs for the cost of the test, Papadopoulos says the research team has tried hard to make it affordable.

One subject, a 30-year-old male, hasn't taken insulin since his stem cell transplant more than three years ago, according to the study in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nThe study suggests a new avenue for treating the intractable disease, in which the immune system destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Without insulin, patients can't metabolize sugar and risk developing nerve damage, cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, and blindness.\n\nPatients with Type-1 diabetes typically compensate by monitoring their blood sugar levels every few hours and injecting themselves with insulin as many as five times a day.\n\nAfter the stem cell treatment, \"patients are absolutely medication-free; they're off insulin,\" said Dr. Richard Burt, chief of the division of immunotherapy at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine and senior author of the study.\n\nThe strategy is similar to an approach showing some success in treating other immune-system disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and multiple sclerosis.\n\n\"We all realize that without addressing the problem at the level of the immune system, we'll never really beat Type-1 diabetes,\" said Dr. Francisco Prieto, who treats diabetics in Elk Grove, Calif., and wasn't involved in the study. \"This is very encouraging work.\"\n\nBurt and his colleagues cautioned that they don't yet know whether the fix is permanent and, if it is not, how long it will last. One of the subjects was insulin-free for one year but then relapsed after a respiratory viral infection, said lead author Dr. Julio Voltarelli, associate professor at Ribeirao Preto Medical School at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil.\n\nThe researchers also cautioned that the process is not without risk, with patients vulnerable to infection during part of the therapy.\n\nBut other doctors said that even if the benefits of the therapy are temporary, the research provides valuable insight into the mechanism behind the disease.\n\nThe Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation in New York estimates that as many as 3 million Americans have Type-1 diabetes, with between 30,000 and 35,000 new cases diagnosed each year.\n\nThe age of onset is considerably younger than for Type-2 diabetes patients, who can still make insulin but can't use it efficiently.\n\nThe stem cell approach mirrors the bone marrow transplants used to treat patients with certain cancers and blood diseases. The idea is to wipe out the faulty immune system and replace it .\n\nIn the study, 15 Brazilian patients were treated within a few months of their diagnosis, before their immune systems had the chance to eradicate all of their insulin-producing cells.\n\nThe study was conducted in Brazil because of Voltarelli's interest in the experiment. It was funded by the Brazilian Ministry of Health and other sources.\n\nThe patients, who ranged in age from 14 to 31, were treated with drugs and hormones that prompted the body to produce hematopoietic stem cells and send them from the bone marrow into the bloodstream, where they were extracted by a special machine.\n\nAbout two weeks later, the patients checked into the hospital and received chemotherapy and other drugs to kill off their immune systems over five days.\n\nAfter a day of rest, they were infused with their own hematopoietic stem cells, which took about eight to 12 days to establish a new immune system. In the interim, they were given antibiotics to protect against infections.\n\nThe treatment had no effect on one patient, whose disease had already progressed too far, doctors decided. Of the remaining 14 patients, 12 were able to stop taking insulin shortly after their transplants. Altogether, five patients have not needed insulin injections for at least 23 months, and two have been insulin-free for more than 18 months.\n\nEven if patients continue to require insulin shots, the treatment should be considered a success if it halts the destruction of beta cells, said Dr. Jay Skyler, with the Diabetes Research Institute at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story states that the new therapy eliminated the need for injections for months or years in 14 of 15 patients, thereby describing absolute benefits.

BMI loss was between 7.1 and 14.7 kg/m2.\n\n\u201cThe median BMI reduction of 10 kg/m2 with the lap band is a good result when compared to BMI reduction using the few medications available or lifestyle measures, which is around 1-3 kg/m2,\u201d says Dr Pe\u00f1a. \u201cLap band surgery is reversible and allows time for adolescents to mature to make a more informed decision on a permanent surgical procedure if required later on in life.

In the eight-week trial, researchers found significant reductions in signs of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein and other blood markers.\n\n\u201cCurcumin is the active ingredient of the famous spice turmeric and has a long history of culinary and medicinal use in the Asian countries,\u201d said the study\u2019s senior author Amirhossein Sahebkar.\n\n\u201cTwo key effects of curcumin that account for most of the therapeutic effects of this compound are its strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties,\u201d said Sahebkar researcher at the Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in Iran, in an email.\n\nThese properties of curcumin have been shown in several animal studies, he noted, but there have been relatively few studies in people. So his team designed a randomized controlled clinical trial to see if short-term use of a curcumin supplement could reduce inflammation in people with metabolic syndrome, a cluster of risk factors for heart disease.\n\nHaving a large waistline, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, low levels of HDL (good) cholesterol and high levels of triglycerides, are among the factors that make up metabolic syndrome. People with three or more of these classic traits are at higher than average risk of developing heart disease or diabetes or both.\n\nInflammation is also emerging as a feature of metabolic syndrome, Sahebkar\u2019s team writes in the journal Clinical Nutrition. They set out to see if curcumin supplements could at least roll back that risk factor by enrolling 117 participants who had been diagnosed with metabolic syndrome for their study.\n\nHalf were given pills containing one gram of curcumin powder, and the other half were given similar looking pills with no curcumin inside. All the participants took the supplements every day for eight weeks.\n\nAt the beginning of the study and again at the end, the researchers measured levels of three blood markers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein (CRP), which even on its own has been linked with heart disease risk.\n\nThey found that the people who took curcumin had improved blood levels of all three biomarkers as well as reduced fasting blood sugar and hemoglobin A1c, a measure of long-term blood sugar levels. The comparison group had higher glucose and levels of one of the inflammation markers, and no changes in the other markers.\n\nThe study team also analyzed data from eight previous studies and confirmed that curcumin had shown a significant reduction of CRP concentrations in a total of 281 patients.\n\n\u201cThe findings of our studies, along with clinical findings reported by other groups, indicate the usefulness of daily use of curcumin supplement for the prevention and treatment of several diseases,\u201d Sahebkar said.\n\nThe researchers didn\u2019t examine the effect of curcumin on any diseases, and it was a fairly brief study, so it\u2019s not clear what the long-term implications may be they caution in their report.\n\nThe study was funded by the Clinical Trial Research Center in Tehran and the Iran National Science Foundation. One of the authors is CEO of Sabinsa Corporation and Sami Labs Ltd, manufacturers of curcumin supplements.\n\nSahebkar said most of the clinical benefits reported for curcumin have been achieved when curcumin was added to a standard drug therapy regimen, and patients should be careful not to replace their prescribed drugs with curcumin without prior consultation with their physician.\n\n\u201cCurcumin is a very safe natural supplement, and there is no severe adverse event associated with its use, even at high doses,\u201d Sahebkar said.\n\nHowever, owing to limited safety information, pregnant and lactating women should avoid using this supplement, Sahebkar said.\n\n\u201cIn addition, patients with malabsorption syndrome, gall bladder problems, gastric ulcer, bleeding problems as well as those who are undergoing surgery, and those who have a history of hypersensitivity to herbal products should be cautious and consult with their physician before taking this supplement,\u201d Sahebkar said.\n\nSahebkar added that he is often asked about the possibility of using turmeric instead of pure curcumin supplements.\n\n\u201cWhilst turmeric is known to have several medicinal properties, and its regular use in diet is strongly suggested, it cannot be regarded as an equivalent substitution of curcumin,\u201d he said.\n\nSahebkar said turmeric contains very low quantities of curcumin, usually less than 5 percent, and curcumin has a very low absorption in its raw form, usually less than one percent of raw curcumin is absorbed when taken orally.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story explains that the study reported \u201cimproved blood levels\u201d of three biomarkers of inflammation, but does not say how much lower the biomarkers were \u2014 or what that might mean in terms of reducing the risk for heart disease.

And for now, the research is preliminary, so it's too early to know for sure if the treatment is appropriate to be used for any kind of depression.\n\nStill, the study suggests that brain stimulation \"not only just helps patients who haven't been able to recover from depression, but it seems to be associated with the absence of relapses.

The level of stimulation is controlled by a pacemaker-like device implanted in the chest.\n\nDeep brain stimulation has been around for more than 20 years, Mayberg said, and is commonly used to treat Parkinson's disease. The cost of the surgery is about $50,000, she said.\n\nPrevious research by Mayberg and others suggested that deep brain stimulation had potential as a treatment for depression. The St. Jude Medical Neuromodulation company, which has provided consulting fees to Mayberg and some of the other study authors, is currently recruiting patients for a study that could pave the way for its approval as a treatment for depression, Mayberg said.\n\nThe new study, which appears online Jan. 2 in the Archives of General Psychiatry, began with 10 patients with depression and seven with bipolar disorder -- a condition that causes severe mood swings and is also known as manic depression. They all received deep brain stimulation for 24 weeks after going through four weeks either with or without stimulation.\n\nMost of the patients continued to receive the treatment over two years, although researchers temporarily turned it off in three of them as part of the study before realizing that doing so caused their depression to return.\n\nThe researchers found that 18 percent of patients went into remission after 24 weeks, 36 percent (of 14 patients) after one year.

Lancet, M.D., senior member and chief of the Leukemia/Myelodysplasia Program at Moffitt Cancer Center and the principal investigator for the study. \"This represents a major step forward for a very difficult-to-treat patient population.\"\n\nVYXEOS also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in induction response rate (CR+CRi of 47.7% versus 33.3%; p=0.016) and this significance was maintained for the analysis of CR alone (CR of 37.3% versus 25.6%, p=0.040).\n\nSixty-day all-cause mortality was 13.7% versus 21.2%, in favor of patients treated with VYXEOS.\n\nNo substantial difference in Grade 3 or higher adverse events was observed between VYXEOS and 7+3. In the intent-to-treat population, Grade 3 or higher, hematologic adverse events were similar for overall infections, febrile neutropenia, and bleeding events. In the intent-to-treat population, Grade 3 or higher, non-hematologic adverse events were similar across all organ systems, including cardiac, gastrointestinal, general systems, metabolic disorders, musculoskeletal, nervous system, respiratory, skin and renal.\n\n\"These findings confirm that VYXEOS provides the first opportunity we've had in decades to extend survival for patients with high-risk AML,\" added Gail Roboz, M.D., Professor of Medicine and Director of the Leukemia Program at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University and the New York-Presbyterian Hospital in New York. \"Also, more patients in remission means more who are eligible for potentially curative therapy.\"\n\nBased on these results the company expects to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) for VYXEOS with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) later this year and submit a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the first quarter of 2017.\n\n\"The successful outcome of this Phase 3 trial represents an important advance for AML patients, their families and clinicians,\" said Scott Jackson, Chief Executive Officer of Celator Pharmaceuticals. \"It also marks a major milestone for Celator, for VYXEOS, and for our CombiPlex\u00ae platform. We offer our sincere thanks to the patients and investigators who participated in this study and we will work closely with regulatory authorities to make this new treatment available to the AML community as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe clinical trial was conducted in partnership with The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society\u00ae (LLS) through its Therapy Acceleration Program (TAP), which has supported the clinical development of VYXEOS beginning in Phase 2.\n\nCelator will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Tuesday, March 15, 2016 at 8:00am EDT to discuss the results of the Phase 3 trial.

VYXEOS represents a novel approach to developing combinations of drugs in which molar ratios of two drugs with synergistic anti-tumor activity are encapsulated in a nano-scale liposome in order to maintain the desired ratio following administration. VYXEOS was granted orphan drug status by the FDA and the European Commission for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). VYXEOS was also granted Fast Track designation for the treatment of elderly patients with secondary AML. In addition to the Phase 3 trial, Celator published results from two randomized, controlled, Phase 2 trials with VYXEOS. The first trial was conducted in newly diagnosed elderly AML patients and the second trial was conducted in patients with AML in first relapse.\n\nThe randomized, controlled, Phase 3 trial (Protocol NCT01696084), enrolled 309 patients at 39 sites in the United States and Canada, and compared VYXEOS to the conventional cytarabine and daunorubicin treatment regimen (commonly referred to as 7+3) as first-line therapy in older (60-75 years of age) patients with high-risk (secondary) AML. Patients were stratified for age (60 to 69 and 70 to 75 years of age) and AML type; treatment-related AML, AML with documented history of MDS with prior treatment with hypomethylating agent therapy, AML with documented history of MDS without prior hypomethlyating agent therapy, AML with a documented history of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL), and de novo AML with a karyotype characteristic of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).\n\nPatients were randomized 1:1 to receive either VYXEOS or 7+3. Patients could receive one or two inductions, and responding patients could receive one or two consolidations. First induction for VYXEOS was 100u/m2; days 1, 3, and 5 by 90-minute infusion and for the control arm was cytarabine 100mg/m2/day by continuous infusion for 7 days and daunorubicin 60mg/m2 on days 1, 2, and 3 (7+3). Second induction for VYXEOS-treated patients was 100u/m2 on days 1 and 3 and the control arm was cytarabine 100mg/m2/day by continuous infusion for 5 days and daunorubicin 60mg/m2 on days 1 and 2 (5+2).\n\nOnly patients with documented CR or CRi were eligible to receive chemotherapy consolidation. Consolidation for VYXEOS-treated patients was 65u/m2 on days 1 and 3 and the control arm was cytarabine 100mg/m2/day by continuous infusion for 5 days and daunorubicin 60mg/m2 on days 1 and 2 (5+2).\n\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rapidly progressing cancer of the blood characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of immature blast cells in the bone marrow. AML is generally a disease of older adults, and the median age of a patient diagnosed with AML is about 67 years. The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be 19,950 new cases of AML and 10,430 deaths from AML in the U.S. in 2016. In Europe the number of new cases is estimated to be 18,000 and in Japan the number is 5,500. The Company estimates that nearly 70 percent of AML patients are over the age of 60, and approximately 75 percent are intermediate or high risk. Furthermore, approximately half of those patients are considered suitable for intensive treatment.\n\nEven with current treatment, overall survival for AML is poor. In patients over 60 years of age, the 5 year survival rate is less than 10%. In high-risk (secondary) AML, overall survival is lower, resulting in an acute need for new treatment options for these patients.\n\nCelator Pharmaceuticals, Inc., with locations in Ewing, N.J., and Vancouver, B.C., is an oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company that is transforming the science of combination therapy, and developing products to improve patient outcomes in cancer. Celator's proprietary technology platform, CombiPlex\u00ae, enables the rational design and rapid evaluation of optimized combinations of anti-cancer drugs, incorporating traditional chemotherapies as well as molecularly targeted agents to deliver enhanced anti-cancer activity. CombiPlex addresses several fundamental shortcomings of conventional combination regimens, as well as the challenges inherent in combination drug development, by identifying the most effective synergistic molar ratio of the drugs being combined in vitro, and fixing this ratio in a nano-scale drug delivery complex to maintain the optimized combination after administration and ensuring exposure of this ratio to the tumor. Celator's pipeline includes the lead product, VYXEOS\u2122 (also known as CPX-351), a nano-scale liposomal formulation of cytarabine:daunorubicin being studied for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia; CPX-1, a nano-scale liposomal formulation of irinotecan:floxuridine studied in colorectal cancer; and a preclinical stage product candidate, CPX-8, a hydrophobic docetaxel prodrug nanoparticle formulation. The Company is advancing its CombiPlex platform and broadening its application to include molecularly targeted therapies.

They also considered how easy each diet was to follow, as well as safety and nutritional value.\n\n\"Besides the rankings and data, each diet has a detailed profile that includes how it works, evidence that supports or refutes its claims and a nutritional snapshot -- tools that, along with the advice of a physician or nutritionist, can help consumers invest in diets that suit their lifestyles and further their health and wellness goals,\" Haupt said.\n\nThe panel evaluated 38 of the most popular or trendy diets this year. After ranking them in nine categories, the experts found the MIND diet tied for second place for best overall diet with the cholesterol-lowering TLC diet. The MIND diet includes some features of the DASH diet and Mediterranean diet, such as high consumption of fruits, vegetables and fish, but focuses on foods that promote brain health.\n\nThe MIND diet ranked first in the \"Easiest Diet to Follow\" category in a three-way tie with Weight Watchers and the Fertility diet, which asserts that certain dietary changes can boost fertility.\n\nThe Fertility diet, which calls for the elimination of trans fats, also ranked as the best diet for diabetes, the report revealed. The Biggest Loser diet and the DASH diet came in second and third, respectively, in the diabetes category.\n\nThe DASH diet scored highest when it comes to healthy eating, followed by the TLC diet.

And with rates of those diseases rising, experts say that more primary care physicians\u2014not neurology experts\u2014will have the task of identifying these patients early so they can take advantage of whatever early interventions might be available.\n\n\u201cIf we had a simple blood test, a cholesterol test for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, that would help,\u201d says Dr. Ronald Petersen, director of the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center at the Mayo Clinic, \u201cbut we don\u2019t.\u201d But Petersen has a potential solution, and according to a new paper released Wednesday in the journal , his Alzheimer\u2019s test has promise.\n\nPetersen and his team wanted to develop a test that any physician can administer to patients, without the need for any new technology or expensive equipment. Petersen believes that the test they came up with could become a useful tool for any physician, even those without special training in the brain. \u201cWhat we are trying to do is give them some help so they can be as efficient as possible without ignoring these important cognitive issues,\u201d he says.\n\nIn the first phase of the test, his researchers simply collected information from 1,500 patients\u2019 medical charts\u2014their age, family history of Alzheimer\u2019s, factors such as diabetes or smoking that have been linked to Alzheimer\u2019s, and whether the patient had ever reported problems with memory.\n\nIn the next phase they studied the results of the patient\u2019s basic mental exam as well as of a psychiatric evaluation, because depression and anxiety have been connected to Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nAnd another factor that emerged as important in developing the disease\u2014how quickly the participant could walk a short distance. \u201cWe were a little surprised,\u201d says Petersen. \u201cBut what\u2019s nice about it is that it\u2019s a nice non-cognitive, motor factor so it\u2019s looking at another aspect of brain function.\u201d\n\nMORE: This Alzheimer\u2019s Breakthrough Could Be a Game Changer\n\nPetersen suggests that every physician should get this information on their patients at age 65; that way, they can have a baseline against which to compare any changes as their patients age. Only if they show such changes \u2014 a slower walk, for example, or worsening signs of depression or memory issues \u2014 should they move on to the third phase of the test, which is a blood analysis. That would look for known genetic factors linked to Alzheimer\u2019s, including the presence of certain versions of the ApoE gene.\n\nCurrently, the only way to truly separate out those on the road to Alzheimer\u2019s is to conduct expensive imaging tests of the brain, or to do a spinal tap, an invasive procedure that extracts spinal fluid for signs of the amyloid protein that builds up in the disease. \u201cWe have either expensive techniques or invasive techniques and it\u2019s not practical to do them from a public health screening standpoint,\u201d says Petersen.\n\nMORE: New Test May Predict Alzheimer\u2019s 10 Years Before Diagnosis\n\nWhile his test is a possible solution to that problem, he acknowledges that the results need be repeated before it\u2019s recommended on a wide scale to physicians across the country. But those who scored higher on the test of risk factors had a seven-fold higher chance of developing mild cognitive impairment than those with lower scores.\n\nFor now, even if doctors identify patients around age 65 who might be at higher risk of developing cognitive impairment, there isn\u2019t much they can do to interrupt the process. But they can direct them toward clinical trials of promising new drugs to address Alzheimer\u2019s dementia, which may slow the cognitive decline considerably.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "We give the story credit for pointing out that there are few if any meaningful interventions available for MCI, and the testing may be useful in the future to identify patients who might benefit. But we have some concerns.\nOur first issue with the story is the emphasis on the early diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u00a0The study was actually directed at early identification of mild cognitive impairment and not Alzheimer\u2019s per se. \u00a0The distinction is important. Although many people with mild cognitive impairment go on to full blown Alzhemier\u2019s, not all do.\nOur second problem with the story is the lack of any meaningful quantification of the results. The story notes, \u201c\u2026those who scored higher on the test of risk factors had a seven-fold higher chance of developing mild cognitive impairment than those with lower scores.\u201d That doesn\u2019t really tell us anything useful about the test results. As a reader, I want to know how good is the test at predicting whether I\u2019m going to be impaired? As it turns out, the \u201c7-fold increase\u201d is not as definitive as suggested by the story. For example, a 70-year-old man with the highest score in the tests has a 1 in 4 chance of developing mild cognitive impairment in the next 5 years. \u00a0That same individual would have about the same risk of a major cardiac event based on the American Heart Association risk calculator.

Three years after receiving two administrations of the bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine four weeks apart, all members of a group of adults with longstanding type 1 diabetes showed an improvement in HbA1c to near normal levels - improvement that persisted for the following five years. The study from a Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) research team - published in npj Vaccines - also reports that the effects of BCG vaccine on blood sugar control appear to depend on a totally novel metabolic mechanism that increases cellular consumption of glucose.\n\n\"This is clinical validation of the potential to stably lower blood sugars to near normal levels with a safe vaccine, even in patients with longstanding disease,\" says Denise Faustman, MD, PhD, director of the MGH Immunobiology Laboratory , principal investigator of BCG clinical trials at MGH and senior author of the npj Vaccines report. \"In addition to the clinical outcomes, we now have a clear understanding of the mechanisms through which limited BCG vaccine doses can make permanent, beneficial changes to the immune system and lower blood sugars in type 1 diabetes.\"\n\nFaustman will also present five-year follow-up results of a separate group of BCG clinical trial participants with longstanding type 1 diabetes on Saturday, June 23, at the 78th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association in Orlando.\n\nUsed for almost a century to prevent tuberculosis, BCG has been known for more than 30 years to boost production of a cytokine called tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which may be beneficial in autoimmune diseases both by eliminating the autoreactive T cells that attack an individual's tissues - in the case of type 1 diabetes, pancreatic islets - and by inducing production of regulatory T cells (Tregs) that could prevent an autoimmune reaction. Faustman's team first reported in 2001 that inducing TNF production could cure type 1 diabetes in mice, but since TNF dosing is toxic in humans, clinical trials have utilized BCG for its ability to elevate TNF levels safely.\n\nInitial clinical trial results, published in a 2012 PLOS One paper, reported that two doses of BCG spaced four weeks apart led to reductions in autoreactive T cells, an increase in Tregs and what turned out to be a transient increase in insulin production. But by the end of that short, 20-week trial, there was no reduction in HbA1c, the established measure of blood sugar levels over time. An extension and expansion of that trial with long term follow-up, the current results are based on data from 282 human study participants - 52 with type 1 diabetes who participated in the BCG clinical trials and 230 who contributed blood samples for mechanistic studies.\n\nRegular monitoring of clinical trial participants found that HbA1c levels of those receiving BCG had dropped by more than 10 percent at three years after treatment and by more than 18 percent at four years. That reduction was maintained over the next four years, with treated participants having an average HbA1c of 6.65, close to the 6.5 considered the threshold for diabetes diagnosis, and with no reports of severe hypoglycemia. Participants in the placebo group and in a comparison group of patients receiving no treatment experienced consistent HbA1c elevations over the same eight-year time period.\n\nIn investigating how BCG administration produces its beneficial effects, the research team identified a mechanism never previously seen in humans in response to treatment with any drug - a shifting of the process of glucose metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation, the most common pathway by which cells convert glucose into energy, to aerobic glycolysis, a process that involves significantly greater glucose consumption by cells. The researchers also found that BCG could reduce blood sugar elevations in mice that were caused by means other than autoimmune attack, raising the possibility that BCG vaccines could also be beneficial against type 2 diabetes.\n\nMihai G. Netea, PhD, professor in the Department of Internal Medicine at Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, says of this study, \"The clinical effects and the proposed mechanism demonstrated are exciting and add to the emerging consensus that the BCG vaccine can have a lasting and valuable impact on the immune system. We know, and this study shows, that BCG vaccination induces epigenetic reprogramming at the chromatin architecture level and functional alterations indicative of a permanent change in immunity. The MGH trials and other, larger prevention and intervention trials underway around the globe may lead to a major shift in the prevention and treatment of infections and autoimmunity.\" Netea was not involved in the current study.\n\nThe MGH team's findings set the stage for further testing of BCG administration, including the FDA-approved phase 2 study currently underway, testing multiple BCG doses in a large group of participants with longstanding type 1 diabetes. That trial is fully enrolled, and there are seven additional BCG clinical trial groups currently recruiting or enrolling at MGH, with a pediatric trial in the planning stages.

Good news for the millions of people who suffer from skin wounds that won\u2019t heal. A team of researchers at The Ohio State University has brought a potentially transformative solution to the problem by creating a portable adhesive patch that drives a continuous, small electrical current to stimulate healing and reduce the risk of infection.\n\nNearly 7 million Americans have chronic wounds \u2013 typically a result of diabetes, obesity or other conditions that impact circulation \u2013 costing the healthcare system nearly $25 billion each year. The non-healing wounds are painful, can permanently damage nerves, prevent mobility and in extreme cases, cause infection that can lead to death.\n\nThe patch\u2019s design significantly advances existing FDA-approved wireless electroceutical dressing (WED) that harnesses the body\u2019s innate response to injury to help wounds heal.\n\n\u201cA wound naturally produces its own electrical fields that help reduce bacteria and promote cell regeneration; however, this function is likely impaired in chronic wounds,\u201d said Sashwati Roy, PhD, an Associate Professor in the Department of Surgery at Ohio State\u2019s College of Medicine. \u201cThe prototype dressing mimics this physiological process, and while it has proven to create an optimal environment where chronic wounds can heal, we are always looking for new ways to keep pathogens under better control.\u201d\n\nRoy notes that chronic wounds are particularly susceptible to infection because bacteria, which at times are free floating within a wound \u2013 can sometimes mobilize, creating colonies covered by a thick sticky coating called a biofilm. The immune system cannot penetrate the biofilm, and antibiotics can\u2019t get in either \u2013 causing constant inflammation and low-level infection that can further dampen the healing process.\n\nNow, with support from Ohio State\u2019s Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS), researchers from both the College of Engineering and the College of Medicine are taking the technology to the next level. Working with a mechanical and aerospace engineering team led by Shaurya Prakash, PhD and Vish Subramaniam, PhD, the scientists have optimized the bandage\u2019s design and the amount of electrical current delivered. Like present WEDs, the new prototype is flexible, portable and self-contained. Made of silk and silver, the experimental dressing includes a self-contained battery that delivers a continuous, safe, low-level electrical current to the injury. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping this new design may allow electric fields and currents to penetrate more deeply into wounds, and really get to where these biofilms may be hiding,\u201d said Subramaniam, chair of the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Ohio State. \u201cThe destruction of the biofilm would enable antibiotics to start killing off bacteria, reduce chronic inflammation and allow the body\u2019s natural immune response to work more effectively. Bacteria are known to quickly acquire resistance against antibiotics, but to our knowledge, bacteria do not develop resistance against electroceuticals.\u201d To test the experimental design, Roy and a team of scientists developed an animal model to mimic the skin function of a person suffering from metabolic syndrome \u2013 obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar - which mirrors the type of patient that typically develops chronic wounds. Animal models had skin injuries infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus or Acinetobacter baumannii, three different types of bacteria that commonly infect wounds and develop biofilms that are treatment resistant.\n\nEarly results, which were presented at the Wound Healing Society\u2019s Annual Meeting in April 2016 indicate that infected wounds covered by the experimental bioelectric dressing healed better and more quickly than those covered with a plain dressing that is commonly used in the care of wounds today. Scientists hypothesize that the electrical currents may disrupt bacteria in two ways: by interrupting the production of chemical messages that instruct bacteria to develop biofilms and by weakening the molecular structure of existing biofilms, potentially making them more susceptible to antibiotics or the body\u2019s natural immune response. The team\u2019s next move is to focus on the bioelectric bandage as a treatment for chronic wounds in a patient population; however, the technology could also be used to treat acute injuries. Roy also notes that the U. S. Department of Defense is very interested in the dressing as a temporary measure to help prevent infection in soldiers wounded on the battle front.\n\n\u201cThis technology has a long shelf life and is compact enough to be put into any field medical kit. It could be applied immediately to wounds help keep bacteria from mobilizing and start promoting healing until the soldier could be transported to a facility for more intensive medical care.\u201d\n\nThe team already has interest from several industry partners, and is hoping to begin testing the new technology in patients before the end of the year to determine optimal treatment duration and more about the healing effects of electrical fields on skin cells on a molecular level.\n\nThe Ohio State University Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) is funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) program (UL1TR001070, KL2TR001068, TL1TR001069) The CTSA program is led by the NIH\u2019s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS).

This research builds upon previous studies demonstrating that art, music, and other similar therapies can effectively reduce symptoms of dementia without medication. By using tablet devices to employ these therapies, however, patients and providers also benefit from a computer's inherent flexibility.\n\n\"The biggest advantage is versatility,\" said Vahia. \"We know that art therapy can work, music therapy can work. The tablet, however, gives you the option of switching from one app to another easily, modifying the therapy seamlessly to suit the individual. You don't need to invest in new equipment or infrastructure.\"\n\nResearchers loaded a menu of 70 apps onto the tablets for the study. The apps were freely available on iTunes and varied greatly in their cognitive complexity--from an app that displayed puppy photos to one that featured Sudoku puzzles.\n\nThe researchers found that tablet use was safe for every patient, regardless of the severity of their dementia, and that with proper supervision and training, the engagement rate with the devices was nearly 100 percent. The study also found that the tablets demonstrated significant effectiveness in reducing symptoms of agitation, particularly--but not exclusively--among patients with milder forms of dementia.\n\nVahia cited several examples of the tablet's potential to improve a patient's condition. One particular patient, who only spoke Romanian, was very withdrawn and irritable, and medications were ineffective in controlling his symptoms.\n\n\"We started showing him Romanian video clips on YouTube, and his behavior changed dramatically and instantaneously,\" said Vahia. \"His mood improved. He became more interactive. He and his medical support team also started using a translation app so that staff could ask him simple questions in Romanian, facilitating increased interaction. These significant improvements are a clear testament of the tablet's potential as a clinical tool.\"\n\nBased on such promising outcomes, the Geriatric Psychiatry Outpatient Services clinical team is expanding the use of tablet devices as a means to control agitation in dementia patients at McLean. This will allow researchers to develop more robust data and expand the scope of the study, including a focus on specific clinical factors that may impact how patients with dementia engage with and respond to apps.\n\nMcLean Hospital is the largest psychiatric affiliate of Harvard Medical School and a member of Partners HealthCare.

But the mechanisms underlying the effect were not well understood.\n\nResearchers in the lab of Jun Wu, research assistant professor at the LSI, wanted to better understand cinnamaldehyde's action and determine whether it might be protective in humans, too.\n\n\"Scientists were finding that this compound affected metabolism,\" said Wu, who also is an assistant professor of molecular and integrative physiology at the U-M Medical School. \"So we wanted to figure out how--what pathway might be involved, what it looked like in mice and what it looked like in human cells.\"\n\nTheir findings, which appear in the December issue of the journal Metabolism, indicated that cinnamaldehyde improves metabolic health by acting directly on fat cells, or adipocytes, inducing them to start burning energy through a process called thermogenesis.\n\nWu and her colleagues tested human adipocytes from volunteers representing a range of ages, ethnicities and body mass indices. When the cells were treated with cinnamaldehyde, the researchers noticed increased expression of several genes and enzymes that enhance lipid metabolism. They also observed an increase in Ucp1 and Fgf21, which are important metabolic regulatory proteins involved in thermogenesis.\n\nAdipocytes normally store energy in the form of lipids. This long-term storage was beneficial to our distant ancestors, who had much less access to high-fat foods and thus a much greater need to store fat. That fat could then be used by the body in times of scarcity or in cold temperatures, which induce adipocytes to convert stored energy into heat.\n\n\"It's only been relatively recently that energy surplus has become a problem,\" Wu said. \"Throughout evolution, the opposite--energy deficiency--has been the problem. So any energy-consuming process usually turns off the moment the body doesn't need it.\"\n\nWith the rising obesity epidemic, researchers like Wu have been looking for ways to prompt fat cells to activate thermogenesis, turning those fat-burning processes back on.\n\nWu believes that cinnamaldehyde may offer one such activation method. And because it is already used widely in the food industry, it might be easier to convince patients to stick to a cinnamon-based treatment than to a traditional drug regimen.\n\n\"Cinnamon has been part of our diets for thousands of years, and people generally enjoy it,\" Wu said. \"So if it can help protect against obesity, too, it may offer an approach to metabolic health that is easier for patients to adhere to.\"\n\nNow, before anyone goes dumping tons of extra cinnamon in their egg nog in hopes of keeping holiday-season pounds at bay, Wu cautioned that further study is needed to determine how best to harness cinnamaldehyde's metabolic benefits without causing adverse side effects.\n\nThe research was supported by the Human Frontier Science Program, Edward Mallinckrodt Jr. Foundation, National Institutes of Health and American Heart Association.\n\nOther study authors were: Juan Jiang, Margo Emont, Heejin Jun, Xiaona Qiao, Jiling Liao and Dong-il Kim, all of U-M.\n\nThe study is titled \"Cinnamaldehyde induces fat cell-autonomous thermogenesis and metabolic reprogramming,\" DOI: 10.1016/j.metabol.2017.08.006.", "question": "Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "This news release does not offer any numbers providing context beyond making the claim that triggering fat burning in cells could reduce obesity.

Keytruda thereby met its main goal of the study.\n\nPatients whose tumors had especially high levels of PD-L1 also went longer without a progression of disease than those taking docetaxel, Merck said.

The method involved deep sequencing \u2013 sequencing DNA 30,000 times over to look for mutations in DNA from tumor cells that floats in the blood.\n\nCancer patients had more of this DNA in their blood, the team found.\n\nThey identified 62 percent of the patients with stage I cancer \u2013 four out of eight colon cancer patients, and 90 percent of colon cancer patients with stage II, III or IV disease.\n\nThey got a positive in 45 percent of the lung cancer patients with stage I disease, 67 percent of ovarian cancer patients with stage I disease and 67 percent of breast cancer patients with stage I disease.\n\nWhile that's good, it's not a great result. The test still missed a large percentage of cancers and will need much improvement, Velculescu said.\n\nIt will also have to be tried in larger groups of patients, and patients with different cancers. The first goal would be to try it in people at high risk of cancer but no symptoms yet \u2013 such as smokers, or people with cancer-causing gene mutations like BRCA mutations, Velculescu said.\n\nWyndham said it will be important to study such tests in large groups of people who have not had cancer diagnosed, to see if it can truly be used to screen asymptomatic people for cancer. And then it will have to be shown that using the test allows doctors to intervene sooner and help people.\n\nCatching cancer in its earliest stages could save many lives. Cancer is the No. 2 killer overall in the United States.\n\n\u201dThe survival difference between late stage and early stage disease in these cancers would account for more than a million lives each year worldwide,\u201d Velculescu said.\n\nThe genetic sequencing is also expensive right now \u2013 on the order of several thousand dollars for the 30,000 repeats the team did. But costs are coming down steadily, he said.\n\nVelculescu said Johns Hopkins had patented this test, and Velculescu is himself the founder of a company that does liquid biopsies for advanced cancer patients called Personal Genome Diagnostics.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been very skeptical of blood tests that claim to diagnose disease before people have symptoms.\n\nThe agency has chastised a company called Pathway Genomics over its \"liquid biopsy\" test , saying the company had not shown the $699 test worked as advertised.\n\nIt\u2019s also warned other gene testing companies but finally gave 23andMe the go-ahead to market its home DNA test \u2013 which does not include any cancer screening \u2013 in April.\n\nCancer screening is still often a tricky issue.\n\nCurrently, colon cancer can be detected very early with colonoscopies, and even stopped before pre-cancerous growths get out of control. But colonoscopies are uncomfortable and carry a small risk of injury.\n\nMammograms can detect early breast cancer, Pap smears can detect cervical cancer or pre-cancerous changes and a type of specialized chest x-ray called a spiral CT can detect lung cancer.

The most recent diagnosis of the neurodegenerative brain disease was given to former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez. But one of the biggest obstacles in understanding CTE has been the inability to diagnose it in the living. New research released Tuesday may make that possible. Published in the journal PLOS One, researchers have found a protein that can be a marker of this devastating disease.\n\n\"This is something new,\" said Dr. Ann McKee , a neuropathologist and senior author of the studyMcKee has performed many of the high profile diagnoses of CTE among former pro-football players and is director of the Boston University CTE Center.\n\nAn early step in the right direction\n\nMcKee also cautioned that this is still early research. \"The next step -- is repeating, validating our findings, and seeing if we can detect it in blood, and of course doing it in living subjects. These are critical next steps,\" she said.\n\nCTE causes Alzheimer's-like symptoms, including memory loss, confusion, aggression, rage and, at times, suicidal behavior. It is believed to result from repeated trauma to the head, which causes a buildup of the abnormal protein tau which clumps in the brain.\n\nIn this new study, researchers found an increased amount of the protein CCL11 in patients previously diagnosed with CTE. CCL11 is a protein commonly associated with inflammation, a process which McKee said can be a trigger for the disease. \"Inflammation is normally a very helpful response in the brain, but when it goes on and persists for a long time, and gets out of control -- that's what we think happens in CTE,\" said McKee.\n\nMore exposure to football increases likeliness of CCL11\n\nThe paper evaluated the brains of 23 deceased football players with CTE, and compared them to the brains of 50 deceased people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and the brains of 18 deceased non-athletes. When compared to the brains without CTE, researchers found those brains with CTE had significantly higher amounts of CCL11, even when compared to those brains with Alzheimer's, another degenerative brain disease. Furthermore, they found that the more years someone played football, the higher amount of the protein. However, contrary to the popularly held belief that a greater number of concussions are linked to CTE , no connection was found between levels of CCL11 and reported number of concussions. In addition, the number of reported concussions tend to be an unreliable indicator in general, because they are usually self reported.\n\nAlthough there are different stages of the disease that indicate how far it has progressed, this study was unable to determine any connections between levels of CCL11 and severity of CTE.\n\n\"The findings of this study are the early steps toward identifying CTE during life. Once we can successfully diagnose CTE in living individuals, we will be much closer to discovering treatments for those who suffer from it,\" said McKee.\n\n\"It is a good step forward but I will be very conservative about the interpretations of the possible application to diagnosis,\" said Dr. Bennet Omalu, the neuropathologist credited with making the first diagnosis of CTE among professional football players. Omalu found traces of the disease in the brain of legendary Pittsburgh Steelers player and pro Hall of Famer Mike Webster in 2002.\n\nWhile Omalu was cautiously optimistic about the development, he also noted that CCL11 isn't unique to the brain disease. \"This is an inflammatory marker that may be non-specific and may not be diagnostic of CTE,\" he said.\n\nWhile it is hoped that this will be one avenue to help detect the disease in the living, McKee believes that it will just be one part of a larger process. \"This may be one of the abnormalities [of the disease], but it may take 2-3 to be useful to diagnose CTE,\" said McKee.\n\n110 of 111 former NFL players found with CTE\n\nA recent analysis by BU found evidence of CTE in 110 of 111 brains of former NFL players. However, there is a potential bias in that study, as relatives of these players may have submitted their brains for diagnosis due to clinical symptoms noticed while the players were alive.\n\nCTE has been detected in veterans, as well as players of other contact sports; however, it has become most associated with football. Along with Hernandez, CTE has been diagnosed in San Diego Charger and Hall of Famer Junior Seau, as well as the Philadelphia Eagles' Kevin Turner and the Oakland Raiders' Ken Stabler, to name a few.\n\nIn 2015, a federal judge approved a class-action lawsuit settlement between the NFL and thousands of former players who accused the league of hiding the dangers of concussions and repeated head trauma.

One expert, Dr. Dale Bredesen, a professor at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and a professor at the Easton Laboratories for Neurodegenerative Disease Research at UCLA, thinks he might have found a way to reverse memory loss, a hallmark of the disease.\n\nIn a study published in the journal Aging, Bredesen and colleagues showed how 10 patients who were experiencing age-related memory decline showed brain scan improvements after following an approach called metabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration (MEND), a 36-point individualized regimen of diet, exercise, brain stimulation, sleep improvements, medication and vitamins and other specific protocols for five to 24 months.\n\nFor example, an MRI of one patient showed hippocampal volume at the 17th percentile for his age range prior to MEND. (The hippocampus is a brain area critical for learning and memory that shrinks in Alzheimer's patients.) After 10 months of following the prescribed protocol, his hippocampal volume increased to the 75th percentile.\n\nThe study noted that some of the patients who had to quit working as a result of their memory decline, were able to return to work after adopting MEND and participants who were struggling at their jobs reported an improvement in job performance.\n\n\"Lives have been dramatically impacted,\" Bredesen told CBS News. \"I'm enthusiastic about that and continue to evolve the protocol.\"\n\nJames E. Galvin, M.D., M.P.H., a professor of clinical biomedical science at FAU's Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine and a professor in the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing, who was not involved in the study, agreed that personalized approaches such as the MEND protocol are the types of approaches needed for this disease going forward. \"It's important to be excited about this approach,\" he told CBS News. However, Galvin cautioned, \"I'm not sure about the method.\"\n\nThe MEND protocol, outlined in a 2014 study in the journal Aging, calls for interventions to treat conditions that could be associated with Alzheimer's such as inflammation, stress and diabetes. However, MEND also requires the use of supplements which are not well studied and do not require FDA approval.\n\n\"Not all things from the approach have a lot of scientific support behind them,\" Galvin told CBS News.\n\nBut Bredesen believes that the only way to treat Alzheimer's is to treat all of the underlying problems, which may require intervention with supplements. \"Nutrition, exercise, sleep, stress reduction -- these are all critical pieces of this,\" he told CBS News. \"It's about optimizing biochemistry for your genetics, whatever it takes.\"\n\nBut even if MEND is effective, the program is complex and difficult to follow. A Buck Institute press release on the study stated: \"None of the patients were able to stick to the entire protocol. The significant diet and lifestyle changes, and multiple pills required each day, were the two most common complaints.\"\n\nBredesen said that to simplify the program, they are connecting patients with health coaches. \"We're trying to make it simpler, but we don't want to lose the efficacy,\" he said.\n\nBredesen noted, too, that the MEND protocol was suitable for patients in the early stages of Alzheimer's. One participant from the 2014 study, who had been diagnosed with late-stage Alzheimer's, did not show improvements with the protocol.\n\n\"If you told me that your mother is 86 and living in a home, I would say that I'd want to treat you,\" he said. \"It's about prevention.\"\n\nBredesen said that his team has a couple of larger trials planned to confirm or refute the results in the current study and to address key questions about how long results can be maintained and how late in the course of cognitive decline reversal is possible.\n\nGalvin agrees that more research is necessary before any conclusive results can be reported. \"This is moving in the right direction,\" he told CBS News. \"These anecdotal case reports provide a nice point to start a discussion.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "In its attempt to quantify the benefits, the story wrongly says 10 patients who were experiencing age-related memory decline showed brain scan improvements after following the MEND program for 5 to 24 months.

The app was developed by researches from the Wisconsin Institute of Surgical Outcomes Research (WiSOR), Department of Surgery, University of Wisconsin, Madison, with the goal of earlier detection of surgical site infections (SSIs) and prevention of hospital readmissions. The study results appear as an \"article in press\" on the website of the Journal of the American College of Surgeons ahead of print.\n\nSSIs are the most common hospital-acquired infection and the leading cause of hospital readmission following an operation.1,2,3 Due to the prevalence off SSIs, the WiSOR research team decided to see if postoperative wound monitoring could be effectively achieved by having patients upload photos through the WoundCare app and answer a few brief questions to gather information not easily captured through images.\n\n\"Patients cannot identify [infections] and frequently ignore or fail to recognize the early signs of cellulitis or other wound complications,\" study authors wrote. \"This drawback leads to the common and frustrating scenario where patients present to a routine, scheduled clinic appointment with an advanced wound complication that requires readmission, with or without reoperation. However, the complication may have been amenable to outpatient management if detected earlier.\"\n\nForty vascular surgery patients were enrolled in the study. There was an overall data submission rate of 90.2 percent among participants, and submissions were reviewed within an average of 9.7 hours. During the study, seven wound complications were detected and one false negative was found.\n\n\"We set out to come up with a protocol where patients could become active participants in their care and allow us to be in closer communication and monitor their wounds after they leave the hospital,\" said lead study author and general surgery resident Rebecca L. Gunter, MD. . \"This approach allows us to intervene at an earlier time rather than waiting for patients to come back in after the problem has already developed past the point of being able to manage it on an outpatient basis.\"\n\nPatients were enthusiastic about the app's ease of use and the reassurance they felt having their wounds regularly monitored. The nurse practitioners responsible for reviewing the submitted images attested to the value of the photos and patient satisfaction, although they also noted it was difficult to find time to review the submitted images on top of an already heavy clinical workload. Study authors note that the success and sustainability of a post-discharge wound-monitoring protocol requires a dedicated transitional care program and not simply adding a task to the current staff workload.\n\nThis protocol also has a cost-savings component, in addition to the patient safety and satisfaction aspects. Study authors note that SSIs are the most expensive hospital-acquired infection, costing an average of nearly $30,000 per wound-related readmission and an estimated $3-10 billion annually.\n\n\"If you could imagine saving the cost from the number of patients whose readmission you were able to prevent, that result could provide significant savings to the health system,\" Dr. Gunter said. Although capturing specific numbers related to cost-savings was not part of this study, Dr. Gunter said it is an important area of focus for future studies.\n\nA limitation to telemedicine protocols that call for the use of smartphones is that not every patient has the necessary technology or knowledge to upload images on their own. The WiSOR research team addressed this issue by having participants undergo tailored training to learn to use the WoundCheck app. They provided each patient with an iPhone 5S and an accompanying visual reference guide to further assist in using the phone and app. Dr. Gunter said they were very successful in giving patients knowledge and access to technology so they could participate in the study. She said this is a model easily adaptable to other medical centers, whether through providing participants with a phone, having a rotating supply of phones at the hospitals for patients to borrow, or relying on a patient's personal device.\n\n\"We have demonstrated that a population of complex and high-risk patients, many of whom are older adults and novice smartphone users, can complete this protocol with high fidelity and satisfaction,\" the researchers concluded.\n\nStudy coauthors from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, include Sara Fernandes-Taylor, PhD, Shahrose Rahman, BS, Lola Awoyinka, MPH, Kyla M.

But a team from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City said the technology could help identify cases where prostate cancer has spread to the bone.\n\nRadiotracers work by injecting a small amount of a compound tagged with a radionuclide into patients. Using positron emission tomography -- also known as a PET scan -- doctors are then able to better visualize tumors and tumor spread.\n\nIn studies involving mice with prostate cancer, the researchers had the radiotracer hone in on prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the same prostate cancer marker used in the PSA test. They found that the PSA gravitated to tissues containing prostate cancer that had already grown resistant to standard hormone-based therapies.\n\nThe study also revealed the radiotracer could help identify cases where prostate cancer had spread to the bone. The researchers pointed out traditional bone scans are unable to differentiate between malignant and nonmalignant lesions.\n\nThe findings were to be presented Saturday at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting in Chicago, and are also being published in Cancer Discovery.\n\nIf used on people, the researchers claimed that the radiotracer might someday help doctors \"personalize\" treatment strategies for prostate cancer and better manage the disease.\n\n\"The ultimate goal is to be able to predict the response of patients to new and existing therapies at an early stage, thereby personalizing their treatment and improving outcomes,\" Michael J.

If a treatment showed a marked change, it could continue to be used in that patient, hence \"personalized\" medicine. If a specific change did not occur, that treatment could be abandoned and another tried instead. Since these changes could not be detected based on a PSA blood test alone, this new test would be very helpful in determining early on which therapy to choose in a given patient.\"\n\nHowever, Goluboff also noted that research from animal-based studies does not always pan out in humans and \"further, larger studies are of course required to confirm these findings.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute provides more information on prostate cancer.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The potential benefit wasn\u2019t quantified \u2013 not even for the mice in question.\nAs with any test, questions about sensitivity and specificity should have been addressed.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Newswise \u2014 Dec. 7, 2018\u2500Vitamin C may reduce the harm done to lungs in infants born to mothers who smoke during their pregnancy, according to a randomized, controlled trial published online in the American Thoracic Society\u2019s American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine.\n\nIn \u201cOral Vitamin C (500 mg/day) to Pregnant Smokers Improves Infant Airway Function at 3 Months: A Randomized Trial,\u201d Cindy T. McEvoy, MD, MCR, and her co-authors report that at three months of age, the infants whose mothers took 500 mg of vitamin C in addition to their prenatal vitamin had significantly better forced expiratory flows (FEFs). FEFs measure how fast air can be exhaled from the lung and are an important measure of lung function because they can detect airway obstruction.\n\nThe researchers also discovered an association between the infant FEFs and a genetic variant some of the mothers possessed that appeared to amplify the negative impact of nicotine on the babies before they were born. Other studies have linked this genetic factor, specifically for the \u03b15 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, to increased risk of lung cancer and obstructive lung disease.\n\n\u201cSmoking during pregnancy reflects the highly addictive nature of nicotine that disproportionately affects the most vulnerable populations,\u201d said Dr. McEvoy, lead study author and professor of pediatrics at Oregon Health & Science University. \u201cFinding a way to help infants exposed to smoking and nicotine in utero recognizes the unique dangers posed by a highly advertised, addictive product and the lifetime effects on offspring who did not choose to be exposed.\u201d\n\nIn a previous study, the authors had shown that 72 hours after birth, babies of mothers who smoked had better lung function if their mothers were randomized to vitamin C (500 mg/day) during their pregnancies compared to those born to mothers who smoked and were randomized to placebo. That study used passive methods to measure lung function, and the authors note that FEFs provide a more direct assessment of airway function and are similar to methods used to diagnose lung disease in adults and older children.\n\nIn the current study, 251 pregnant women who smoked were randomly assigned at 13 to 23 weeks of gestation to either receive vitamin C (125 women) or a placebo (126 women). Smoking was defined as having had one or more cigarettes in the last week. All participants received smoking cessation counseling throughout the study, and about 10 percent of the women quit smoking during the study.\n\nThe researchers wrote that study results support the hypothesis that oxidative stress caused by cigarette smoking reduces the amount of ascorbic acid, a component of vitamin C, available to the body. At the time they enrolled in the study, the women had lower levels of ascorbic acid than have been reported among women who do not smoke. Those levels rose in study participants who received vitamin C to become comparable to women who do not smoke.\n\nInfants in this study will continue to be followed to track their lung function and respiratory outcomes. The authors believe that future trials of vitamin C supplementation in pregnant smokers should determine whether the benefits are greater if the supplementation starts earlier and continues postnatally in the babies themselves.\n\nSumming up the findings of the current study, Dr. McEvoy said that a relatively low dosage of vitamin C may present \u201ca safe and inexpensive intervention that has the potential to help lung health of millions of infants worldwide.\u201d\n\nHowever, she added, helping mothers quit smoking should remain the primary goal for health professionals and public health officials. \u201cAlthough vitamin C supplementation may protect to some extent the lungs of babies born to mothers who smoke during pregnancy, those children will still be at greater risk for obesity, behavioral disorders and other serious health issues,\u201d she said.\n\nThis study was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the Office of Dietary Supplements.\n\n\u201cFor mothers who smoke during pregnancy, vitamin C may reduce harm #smoking causes to their babies\u2019 #lungs, finds new study of #vitaminC supplementation. #Nosmokingduringpregnancy.\u201d\n\nAbout the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine\n\nThe AJRCCM is a peer-reviewed journal published by the American Thoracic Society.

About one in 30,000 of newborn boys have the disease, with about 3,000 patients in the United States.\n\nDr. Nathwani and his team reported that they treated the patients by infusing the delivery virus into their veins. The virus homes in on the cells of the liver, and the gene it carries then churns out correct copies of Factor IX. A single injection enabled the patients to produce small amounts of Factor IX, enough that four of the six could stop the usual treatment, injections of Factor IX concentrate prepared from donated blood. The other two patients continued to need concentrate, but less frequently.\n\nTreating a patient with concentrate costs $300,000 a year, with a possible lifetime cost of $20 million, but the single required injection of the new delivery virus costs just $30,000, Dr. Katherine P. Ponder of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis notes in her commentary in The New England Journal of Medicine, calling the trial \u201ca landmark study.\u201d\n\nThe patients have continued to produce their own Factor IX for up to 22 months, said Dr. Edward G. D. Tuddenham, director of the Hemophilia Center at the Royal Free Hospital in London. One patient, a geologist, had a good response at first, but his level of Factor IX has declined to 1 percent of normal, the level at which the disease kicks in.\n\n\u201cWe attribute this to the fact that he had an inflammation, and although we treated it promptly, we should have been quicker off the mark,\u201d Dr. Tuddenham said.\n\nThe patient cannot be injected again with the same virus because his immune system is now primed to attack it. \u201cHe\u2019s very philosophic about it, but he\u2019s a scientist, and his motivation is to help the science,\u201d Dr. Tuddenham said.\n\nTwenty more patients will be treated to assess the best dose of the virus, the goal being the highest dose that does not set off an immune system attack, Dr. Tuddenham said. \u201cWe are pretty close to the sweet spot,\u201d he said. If all goes well, a genetic treatment for hemophilia B \u201ccould be available for widespread use in a couple of years.\u201d\n\nIn a trial in 2006, a patient injected with a corrective gene produced his own Factor IX but only for 10 weeks. The designer of that treatment, Dr. Katherine A. High of Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the new therapy had worked because the delivery virus had been made more efficient and because the research team had treated the patients with steroids to suppress immune system attacks on the virus.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s incredibly exciting, and I say that even though these people are my competitors,\u201d she said. Dr. High is listed as a co-author of the report because her laboratory helped monitor the patients and provided proof for regulators that the virus would not insert its human gene into the patients\u2019 sperm and make the change hereditary.\n\nA serious problem with other delivery viruses is that they insert themselves randomly into chromosomes, sometimes disrupting a gene. The virus used by Dr. Nathwani\u2019s team, known as adeno-associated virus-8, generally stays outside the chromosomes, so it should not present this problem. Still, patients will need to be monitored for liver cancer, a small possibility that has been observed in mice.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a showstopper, but it\u2019s a critical safety issue that has to be assessed,\u201d Dr. High said.\n\nPatients have little or no immunity to the adeno-associated virus, which infects rhesus monkeys. The virus has a propensity for making liver cells its target, which is good for the therapy because these cells are the natural producers of Factor IX. However, liver cells do not live forever and slowly replenish themselves, possibly limiting how long the therapy will last.\n\nAbout 80 percent of hemophilia cases are of the type known as hemophilia A, which is caused by defects in a different blood-clotting agent, Factor VIII. Researchers have focused on hemophilia B, in part, because the Factor IX gene is much smaller and easier to work with.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story states that six patients were \u201csuccessfully treated\u201d and explained that treated patients \u201ccontinued to produce their own Factor IX for up to 22 months,\u201d and notes that one patient had an initial good response but his Factor IX levels declined.\u00a0 It also points out that because his immune system recognized the viral vector, it is now sensitized to respond in the future and he now can\u2019t be treated again.\u00a0 That would mean that five of six \u2013 not six of six \u2013 were successfully treated.\nThere was also no comment about what difference these blood test changes made in patients\u2019 lives \u2013 how they felt.\nNonetheless, we\u2019ll give the story the benefit of the doubt.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "When I began training last year for my first marathon, my running partner Dave Freedholm, an experienced amateur distance runner, impressed on me the need to vigilantly avoid dehydration.

A mere sip would leave her vomiting and gasping for breath. If she were even touched by someone with milk on their hands, she would break out in hives and a bright red rash.\n\n\"We just had to keep her away from milk,\" said Reagan's mother, Lissa. \"We couldn't have it around the house. At preschool she had to sit by herself. We brought her food to birthday parties. We couldn't go to restaurants. It was very hard.\"\n\nToday, however, Reagan, 9, of Ellicott City, can drink as much milk as she wants and eat anything.\n\n\"She eats ice cream. She eats cheese. She eats yogurt. She drinks chocolate milk. She eats any food anybody else can,\" Lissa Roberts said. \"It's a miracle.\"\n\nReagan is one of a small number of children who have undergone an experimental treatment that is showing promise for treating milk, peanut and other food allergies. The approach, known as oral immunotherapy, involves slowly desensitizing the immune system by painstakingly ingesting increasing amounts of whatever triggers the reaction.\n\n\"It's pretty encouraging,\" said Robert A. Wood, chief of pediatric allergy and immunology at Johns Hopkins, who led the study that Reagan participated in at the Hopkins Children's Center in Baltimore. \"We've still got a long way to go, but I never thought we'd get this far.\"\n\nAlthough the approach appears to be highly effective for some children with milk and peanut allergies, the researchers conducting the studies and others caution that much more research is needed to prove and perfect the approach and that it is far from ready for widespread use. No one should try the approach on his own, because the treatments themselves can trigger potentially life-threatening reactions.\n\n\"It's still very investigational,\" said Wesley Burks, chief of the division of pediatric allergy and immunology at Duke University, who has produced promising results in children with peanut allergies. \"We're very hopeful. But there are lot of things we need to do to understand it better, make it more effective and make sure it's safe.\"\n\nThe strategy is being tested in a handful of small studies that are part of a surge of research in a field that for years showed little progress.\n\n\"There's been a substantial uptick in the amount of research,\" said Marshall Plaut of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which has more than doubled the funding for food-allergy research since 2007. \"I think it's time to be cautiously optimistic.\"\n\nIn addition to the oral immunotherapy studies, scientists are in the early stages of testing an experimental suppository, a Chinese herbal remedy and variations of oral immunotherapy that might be safer and more effective.\n\n\"There's definitely been a spike in the amount of work going on,\" said Hugh A. Sampson, a professor of pediatrics, allergy and immunology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York who leads a federally funded consortium studying food allergies. \"Five years ago there was almost nothing going on in people with respect to therapies, whereas now there are a variety of different therapies being looked at.\"\n\nThe spike in research has been driven by increasing evidence that food allergies are becoming more common, occurring earlier in life and lasting longer. About 12 million Americans are estimated to suffer from food allergies, including about 3 million children. Some evidence suggests that peanut allergies may have doubled in children in the past decade.\n\nThe reason for the trend is the subject of intense research and debate. There are several theories, including changes in how food is processed and children's not being exposed to certain foods early in life. Evidence has also been mounting for the \"hygiene hypothesis,\" which blames growing up in increasingly sterile homes, making the immune system overreact to ordinarily harmless substances, including food.\n\nWhatever the cause, researchers have long struggled to develop therapies. Food allergies can trigger symptoms ranging from rashes and hives to responses believed to cause perhaps 200 deaths each year in the United States. Currently, food-allergic people have only two options: to avoid the substance that causes their reaction or to try to stop a reaction with an injection of epinephrine.\n\nThat leaves parents of allergic children scouring food labels, avoiding restaurants, sending their children to school and parties with specially made food and snacks, and still worrying about inadvertent contact with peanuts, milk, eggs and other ubiquitous foods.\n\n\"It's hard to live,\" said Angie Duty of Durham, N.C., whose 9-year-old son, Sam, was intensely allergic to peanuts before undergoing the therapy as part of one Burks's studies. \"Sam doesn't like to be different, but of course he is different and we have to explain that to him.\"\n\nAlthough doctors have long used shots to desensitize people allergic to pollen and other substances, early attempts to do the same for food allergies ended in failure.\n\n\"The side effects were so great that they were as bad if not worse than the disease itself,\" Burks said.\n\nBut a small number of researchers in recent years have begun trying the approach again, this time by orally administering the protein in the food that triggers the allergic reaction.\n\nWith doctors standing by in case of a severe reaction, each study subject undergoes careful testing to determine the maximum dose he or she can safely tolerate. Once that is established, the participants are sent home to sprinkle that amount of purified protein on their food for a week or two; then they return to the research center in to see if the dose can be increased. The procedure is repeated for months or even years to slowly raise the amount they can safely consume.\n\n\"It's a way of sort of rerouting or tricking the immune system to no longer be allergic to that food,\" said Stacie Jones, chief of allergy and immunology at the Arkansas Children's Hospital, who has been working Burks to test the approach for peanut allergies.\n\nIn a study involving 19 children who were severely allergic to milk, Wood found that within four to six months most of the children significantly increased the amount of milk protein they could tolerate. After between about nine months and two years, about half of the children could safely consume as much milk or food containing milk as they wanted.\n\n\"These are children who could have died from a teaspoon of milk before,\" Wood said.\n\nIn March, Burks and Jones reported the results of a pilot study involving 33 children with peanut allergies. The children started by ingesting peanut protein powder equivalent to one one-thousandth of a peanut. Four of the children had to drop out because of allergic reactions, but six of nine children who underwent the treatment for 2 1/2 years have been able to stop the peanut powder and have now gone six to eight months without reacting to eating peanuts. \"It's fabulous,\" said Janet Vande Berg of Durham, N.C., whose 9-year-old daughter, Caroline, can eat peanuts for the first time in her life. \"It makes a huge, huge difference in the quality of life for both the kids and the families. It just takes the stress away.\"\n\nThe researchers are tracking the remaining children in the study to see if any others achieve similar results and have followed up with a more stringent study in which 13 children received a similar treatment and seven received a placebo.\n\nAfter about 10 months, all seven children on the placebo were still allergic, whereas none of the 13 on the peanut powder had reactions when they were challenged. All the children are now receiving the treatment and are being followed to see if they remain desensitized and perhaps become \"tolerant,\" meaning they no longer need to consume daily doses of peanuts or peanut protein to maintain their ability to eat peanuts freely.\n\n\"I think it's an important advance in the field,\" said the NIH's Plaut. \"It's a small number of subjects, so it's hard to draw full-blown conclusions. But it's the first data that suggest you may be able to achieve something like this in food allergies.\"\n\nIt remains far from clear, however, what proportion of children will benefit, how long the benefit might last and what proportion will need to continue to consume at least some milk or peanuts every day to maintain their protection. While some children, such as Vande Berg, appear to completely lose their allergies, others seem to just be able to eat more of the milk or food before reacting. But even that can be helpful.\n\n\"We know this therapy at least protects them from accidental ingestion so they won't have a life-threatening reaction,\" said Jones, the Arkansas researcher. \"At the very least it's providing some security for these families.\"\n\nBurks and Jones are part of the federal consortium, which is studying the same approach for eggs at research institutions across the country, including Johns Hopkins, and conducting detailed immunological studies to try to get a better understanding of how the treatment works.\n\nMeanwhile, researchers in London are studying 640 babies at high risk for food allergies to see if exposing them to peanuts early in life reduces their chances of developing the allergy in the first place.\n\n\"There are a lot of people putting ideas out there and producing some promising preliminary data,\" Plaut said. \"That makes me think there will be some important developments in the future.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "\u00a0The story included absolute risk reduction data from the milk and peanut studies. \u00a0\n\u00a0", "answer": 1}, {"article": "WEDNESDAY, Nov. 10, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Offering your baby a special formula when weaning off breastfeeding may offer some protection against the development of the antibodies associated with type 1 diabetes, if you have a family history of the disease, new research suggests.\n\nWhen Finnish researchers randomly assigned 230 babies at high risk of type 1 diabetes to receive either a regular infant formula, or one that was extensively hydrolyzed -- which means the proteins in the formula are already partially broken down and more readily available for digestion -- they found that the extensively hydrolyzed formula cut the rate of developing diabetes-linked antibodies in the blood by about half.\n\n\"We observed that early dietary intervention [with extensively hydrolyzed formula] decreased the frequency of diabetes-associated autoantibodies, which are markers of an ongoing disease process, by about 50 percent by the age of 10 years,\" said the study's lead author, Dr. Michael Knip, a professor of pediatrics at the Hospital for Children and Adolescents in Helsinki, Finland.\n\nThe results of the study were published in the Nov. 11 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, which means the body's immune system mistakenly turns against healthy insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, instead of a foreign material, such as bacteria. No one knows for sure what causes this process to begin, but some research suggests that the initial autoimmunity may begin early in life.\n\nFive immune system autoantibodies have been linked to type 1 diabetes. Having one of these antibodies isn't a guarantee that you'll develop type 1 diabetes, but it does indicate an increased risk for the disease. People who have two or more type 1 antibodies have between a 50 and 100 percent risk of developing type 1 diabetes, according to background information in the study.\n\nPrevious research has suggested that breastfeeding may offer some protection against the development of these antibodies, possibly because breastfeeding delays the introduction of infant formula, which contains complex proteins. Formula may somehow trigger the development of autoantibodies as these proteins are broken down for digestion.\n\nThe current study was randomized and double-blind (meaning neither the parents nor the researchers knew who was getting what), and compared regular baby formula to one that was made easier for babies to digest because the proteins were broken down (extensively hydrolyzed).\n\nBabies were offered the formula during the first 6 to 8 months of life, any time breastfeeding wasn't available. They were then followed till they were about 10 years old, according to the study.\n\nAfter adjusting the data to try to account for the duration of exposure to one of the study formulas, the researchers found that the extensively hydrolyzed formula reduced the risk of having one diabetes autoantibody by 49 percent, and the risk of having two or more autoantibodies by 53 percent.\n\nHow the highly hydrolyzed formula might reduce the risk of developing diabetes-predictive antibodies is unknown, but the researchers speculated that it might contribute to reduced gut permeability or changes in gut microflora, among other things.\n\nAccording to Knip, the take-home message from the study is that \"it is possible to reduce considerably the initiation of the diabetes disease process in at-risk children in a simple and safe way: weaning to an extensively hydrolyzed formula.\" He added that, \"based on the current results, we think that it is justified to recommend weaning to a highly hydrolyzed formula for babies in families with a member affected by type 1 diabetes.\"\n\nNot everyone agreed with that notion, however.\n\n\"The data in this study is not sufficiently strong to support recommending any changes for parents,\" said the author of an accompanying editorial, Dr. David Harlan, co-director of the Diabetes Center of Excellence at the University of Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center in Worcester.\n\n\"I think the authors designed this study to address their hypothesis that proteins present in non-hydrolyzed formula might incite an immune response, and by breaking them down, you might eliminate the immune response. But, there are quite a few steps between that and how the immune system or diabetes are triggered,\" added Harlan's editorial co-author, Dr. Mary Lee, a professor of pediatrics and cell biology and chief of the pediatric endocrine division at the University of Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center.\n\n\"I think this is an important study because we need to understand what causes type 1 diabetes,\" said Harlan, who added the caveat: \"In this study, while there is an apparent signal, there are also some causes for withholding complete faith in the conclusion that the formula caused diabetes.\"\n\nBoth Lee and Harlan stressed that there is currently no definitive evidence to suggest that the use of standard cow's milk formulas leads to an increased incidence of diabetes compared to breastfeeding.

In addition, studies show that bystanders are often reluctant to perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on strangers, but are more likely to try rapid chest compression.\n\n\"We think that if we can double the number of bystanders who attempt CPR, we can save tens of thousands of lives every year,\" said Mary Fran Hazinski, a nurse at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and spokeswoman for the American Heart Association.\n\nSudden cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death in the United States. Every day, it claims 900 American lives. Only about 6 percent of victims whose hearts stop outside of a hospital survive.\n\nStudies show that either mouth-to-mouth or hands-only CPR may double the survival rate from cardiac arrest, but bystanders typically step in to provide the potentially life-saving intervention in only about one-third of cases. That hesitation is rooted not only in reluctance to lock lips with a stranger, but by anxiety over how to perform conventional CPR, in which the rescuer breathes into the victim twice after every 30 chest compressions.\n\n\"Many times people nearby don't help because they're afraid that they will hurt the victim and aren't real confident in what they're doing,\" said Michael Sayre, chairman of the Heart Association committee that rewrote the guidelines.\n\nIn fact, effective chest compression can break the victim's ribs about one-third of the time. That's a risk well worth taking when the odds of survival without CPR are so slim.\n\nThe Heart Association also stressed that three-quarters of sudden cardiac arrest cases outside the hospital occur in the home. The bystander who needs to provide those chest compressions is often a loved one of the victim.\n\nConventional CPR that combines both chest compression and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation has been taught in first aid classes since the 1960s. That method has been under review since 1997. Two years ago, after considering multiple studies, the Heart Association recommended hands-only CPR only in cases where people were unwilling or unable to provide the rescue breaths as well.\n\nThe latest revision stems from three major studies published last year that showed no advantage in using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation in cardiac cases.\n\nDr. Chris Barton, acting chief of the Emergency Department at San Francisco General Hospital, supports the new guidelines. He said the latest research on CPR supports the notion that in the critical minutes before an ambulance or defibrillation device arrives, it is very important to provide uninterrupted, deep chest compressions.\n\n\"You want the chest to go down about 2 inches. I weigh 160 pounds, and when I do this I put about half my weight into it,\" he said. The pressure should be applied to the center of the chest, between the two nipples of the victim.\n\nThe compressions also have to come in rapid succession - about 100 per minute. According to Hazinski, one easy way to remember the rhythm is that it is roughly equivalent to the beat of the 1977 Bee Gees' disco hit \"Stayin' Alive.\"\n\n\"If you are untrained, just remember to push hard and push fast,\" Hazinski said. \"Doing something is better than doing nothing.\"\n\nThese new guidelines are aimed at untrained bystanders, or to those who have been trained in CPR but are unsure they can perform it adequately. The message is, if there is any doubt, provide \"hands only\" CPR.\n\nAlthough survival rates for cardiac arrest hover around 10 percent with CPR, Hazinski noted that rates have been pushed as high as 30 percent in cities, such as Seattle, that combine high bystander participation with a strong system of professional emergency medical response.\n\nAt best, CPR is a desperate measure. Survival rates are highly dependent on prompt arrival of a defibrillator - the kind carried by ambulance crews and increasingly available in public venues such as airports and sports stadiums.\n\n\"If you have access to an AED (Automated External Defibrillator), you want to apply that as early as possible,\" advised San Francisco General's Barton. \"Early defibrillation is the most successful intervention you can do.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The article says that CPR in any form \"may double the rate of survival from cardiac rest.\" According to a spokesperson for the American Heart Association, this means that \u201cwe can save tens of thousands of lives.\u201d\u00a0 Later in the story the spokesperson is reported as saying that when more people use CPR in cities such as Seattle, survival rates have jumped to as high as 30%.

It may be possible to predict autism in infants as young as 6 months who have older siblings with the disorder, according to a new study by a national network of researchers.\n\nInfants in such families are at increased risk of developing autism, which is typically diagnosed when a child is 2- to 3-years-old and develops symptoms such as challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, delayed speech or nonverbal communication.\n\nResearchers used magnetic resonance imaging \u2014 or MRI \u2014 to scan the brains of 343 infants when they were 6 months, 12 months and 24 months old. Two-thirds of the infants were high risk, having an older sibling with autism. The scans showed that 70 percent of high-risk toddlers diagnosed with autism at age 2 had an elevated amount of cerebrospinal fluid around their brains at 6 and 12 months, compared to toddlers who were not diagnosed with autism. Cerebrospinal fluid is a clear, colorless liquid that bathes the brain and spine.\n\nThis excess fluid \u201ccould possibly be an early biological marker for autism,\u201d said Mark Shen, the lead author of the article, published in Biological Psychiatry, and a post-doctoral fellow at the University of North Carolina\u2019s Carolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities. Additional studies are needed to confirm the finding, he said.\n\nSuch a marker would allow doctors to identify infants at high risk of developing autism before symptoms are present.\n\n\u201cThe earlier we can get biological markers for autism, the earlier intervention can be initiated, and the greater the chance of better outcomes, \u201d said David Kennedy, Ph.D., co-director of the Child and Adolescent NeuroDevelopment Initiative at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.

It may also be a mechanism in the development of autism, and it opens up new possibilities for research, she said. \u201cYou can start thinking about conditions that might lead to increased cerebrospinal fluid.\u201d\n\nShen and his colleagues are already looking for genes associated with excess brain fluid. Normally, the liquid, refreshed four times a day, washes away byproducts that build up in the brain. But if the fluid is not flowing properly, these byproducts hang around and cause inflammation, which could \u201champer brain development\u201d and lead to autism, said Shen.\n\nCompletely different mechanisms may be at work for kids without an older sibling with autism, said Shen and Dimartino.

In addition to flushing out the brain\u2019s garbage, brain fluid also delivers signals to the brain that tell it how and when to grow.

Most of the population is thought to get adequate amounts for that reason.\n\nDuring the study, Sweden did not fortify foods, nor did kids use a lot of supplements. Folic acid is naturally present in green, leafy vegetables and legumes.\n\nThe new study is among the first to examine whether folate is tied to school achievements, according to Dr. Torbjorn Nilsson of Orebro University Hospital and his colleagues.\n\nThe researchers looked at 386 15-year-olds who were finishing up ninth grade. When all their grades from ten core classes were added up, there was a clear difference between teens who got the most and the least folic acid in their diets.\n\nTeens in the top third of folic acid intake \u2014 more than 253 micrograms per day for girls and 335 for boys \u2014 scored grades of 139 out of 200, on average. Those in the bottom third \u2014 less than 173 micrograms folic acid per day for girls and 227 for boys \u2014 had an average score of only 120.\n\nThe differences remained even after the researchers accounted for gender, smoking, the mothers\u2019 education and which schools the kids went to.\n\nO\u2019Connor, of the University of Toronto and the Hospital for Sick Children in Ontario, Canada, called the findings \u201cpretty significant.\u201d\n\nStill, she said, you can\u2019t be sure if the kids who performed better had a better diet in general or if some other hidden factor could explain the results.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a randomized controlled trial, so you always wonder, are there other things going on that you weren\u2019t able to control for?\u201d she said. \u201cLike most studies, it probably raises more questions than it answers.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S., kids aged 9 to 13 should get a total of 300 micrograms of folate a day from food and supplements according to the Institute of Medicine\u2019s \u201cDietary Reference Intakes.\u201d Kids 14 and older and adults are urged to get 400 micrograms a day and pregnant women should get 600 micrograms.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story provided the data on the summation of grades showing the difference in folic acid levels in the children in the highest and lowest groups. \u00a0While it is nice to have absolute grade difference provided, it would have been useful to indicate whether these differences were statistically significant or whether the differences in folic acid intake were clinically significant.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "When Dr. Benjamin Lee set out to treat Joseph Davis' kidney cancer, the Tulane University urologist and surgeon didn't use radiation or chemotherapy. Instead, he chose cold.\n\nAs in 90 degrees below zero.\n\nWorking with tiny instruments that he helped design, Lee guided the devices into the Metairie man's midsection through an incision the size of a quarter. Then he used a concentrated combination of nitrogen and argon to freeze the tumors and kill the cancer cells. From that point on, the chemicals in Davis' body took over, breaking down and absorbing the deactivated tumors -- Lee calls them \"ice balls\" -- in a months-long process.\n\nThe big chill was so localized, and the area of attack was so small, that Davis, 65, said he didn't feel anything during or after the March 30 procedure, which lasted about an hour.\n\nAfter a brief hospital stay, Davis, a retired airline baggage handler, said he was up and about in two weeks, compared with months of recovery that conventional surgery requires. The recovery has been pain-free, and the cancer hasn't returned, he said.\n\nThis technique, which Lee helped develop and has been using for about a year, represents a big advance over conventional kidney-cancer surgery, which can require a foot-long incision and, sometimes, removal of a rib so the doctor can reach the malignancy, according to experts.\n\nIt even represents an advance over conventional laparoscopic surgery, which requires separate incisions for devices that can grasp and sever the cancer, as well as an endoscope that provides illumination and a view of the target area, said Marvin Guiles, director of engineering at Cambridge Endo, who worked on the instruments with Lee.\n\nOnly one incision is required because Lee and other doctors can use a device called a trocar, which has holes for each instrument and the endoscope. Besides providing an entry point, the trocar makes a seal at the incision point to prevent the leakage of carbon dioxide, which is pumped into the abdomen to give the surgeon more space in which to work.\n\nThe hook, grasper and scissors are on the ends of shafts less than one-fifth of an inch wide. Besides being tiny, Guiles said they offer the advantage of flexibility.\n\nWhile keeping an eye on his progress on an operating-room monitor, Lee was able to move the tools into position and administer two freezing blasts through a needle probe that had been inserted through Davis' skin and placed inside the tumor.\n\n\"The ice ball forms very rapidly, \" Lee said.\n\n\"I was amazed at what they could do through that opening with those tools . . . to manipulate the tools and not destroy you in the process, \" he said.\n\nTechnically known as single-port cryosurgery, the technique is used only for cancers no bigger than an inch and a half wide that haven't spread beyond the kidney, Lee said.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, the five-year survival rate for kidney cancer found at this stage is 96 percent. This form of cancer strikes about 57,760 Americans every year, according to the organization. About 12,980 die of the cancer each year.\n\nWhile kidney cancer can have symptoms such as back pain and bloody urine, it's difficult to detect early, said Lee, who said about half of these tumors are found when people undergo X-rays for other reasons.\n\nThat was what happened to Davis, who had gone to a hospital for a kidney stone. His doctor saw a suspicious growth on Davis' kidney and referred him to Lee.\n\nDavis said he chose single-port cryosurgery \"because I didn't want to be cut wide open any more than I had to be.\"\n\nWhile the procedure may look straightforward, it's extremely delicate, said Linda Cormier, a sales representative for Cambridge Endo, whose headquarters is in Framingham, Mass.\n\nIf a rare mishap occurs, the doctor will have to resort to conventional surgery, requiring a much bigger incision.\n\nDavis said he was aware of that possibility before he underwent the procedure. He also knew that the cancer happened to be a spot where the small instruments couldn't reach it, the operation might have to be much more extensive.\n\nThat was the first thought on Davis' mind as he returned to consciousness in the recovery room, he said. \"When I woke up and saw that I wasn't all bandaged up, I said, \"Aha! I'm OK!' \"\n\nJohn Pope can be reached at jpope@timespicayune.com or at 504.826.3317.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story does not adequately quantify the benefit of cryosurgery, other than in reducing recovery time.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "DUARTE, Calif. -- A City of Hope-led study found that the use of low-dose aspirin (81mg) reduces the risk of breast cancer in women who are part of the California's Teacher's Study.

Such regular use of low-dose aspirin reduced the risk by 20 percent of estrogen or progesterone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer, which is the most common breast cancer subtype.\n\n\"The study found an interesting protective association between low-dose aspirin and breast cancer,\" said lead author Christina A. Clarke, Ph.D., M.P.H., from the Cancer Prevention Institute of California. \"We did not by and large find associations with the other pain medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. We also did not find associations with regular aspirin since this type of medication is taken sporadically for headaches or other pain, and not daily for prevention of cardiovascular disease.\"\n\nThis study differed from other studies that have looked at aspirin and cancer risk because it focused on the dose levels of the aspirin women had taken and tracked the frequency of the use of low-dose aspirin as opposed to regular aspirin. It was also able to look in detail at subtypes of breast cancer.\n\n\"We already knew that aspirin is a weak aromatase inhibitor and we treat women with breast cancer with stronger aromatase inhibitors since they reduce the amount of estrogen postmenopausal women have circulating in their blood,\" said Bernstein. \"We thought that if aspirin can inhibit aromatase, it ought to reduce the likelihood that breast cancer would develop and it could also be an effective way to improve breast cancer patients' prognosis once they no longer take the more potent aromatase inhibitors.\" Bernstein added, \"Aspirin also reduces inflammation, which may be another mechanism by which aspirin taken regularly can lower risk of breast cancer developing or recurring.\"\n\nAs part of the study, researchers analyzed data recorded in questionnaires submitted by 57,164 women in the California's Teacher's Study. In 2005, participants answered questions regarding family history of cancer and other conditions, use of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), menstrual and reproductive history, use of hormones, weight and height, living environment, diet, alcohol use and physical activity. In the ensuing years before 2013, 1,457 of these participants developed invasive breast cancer.\n\nThe team of researchers chose to focus on low-dose \"baby\" aspirin, because not only is it inexpensive and readily available as potential means of prevention, but because there are already a lot of people already taking it for prevention of other diseases such as heart disease and even colon cancer.\n\nNow that we have some data separating low-dose from higher-dose aspirin, more detailed research can be undertaken to understand the full value of low-dose aspirin for breast cancer prevention,\" said Clarke.\"\n\nOther collaborating authors include Alison J.

Diet has been extensively studied as a modifiable risk factor in the development of breast cancer but epidemiologic evidence on the effect of specific dietary factors is inconsistent.\n\nThe Mediterranean diet is known for its abundance of plant foods, fish and especially olive oil. Miguel A. Mart\u00ednez-Gonz\u00e1lez, M.D., of the University of Navarra in Pamplona and CIBEROBN in Madrid, Spain, and coauthors analyzed the effects of two interventions with the Mediterranean diet (supplemented with extra virgin olive oil [EVOO] or nuts) compared with advice to women to follow a low-fat diet. Study participants in the two intervention groups were given EVOO (one liter per week for the participants and their families) or mixed nuts (30 grams per day: 15 grams of walnuts, 7.5 grams of hazelnuts and 7.5 grams of almonds).\n\nThe study was conducted within the framework of the large PREDIMED (Prevenci\u00f3n con Dieta Mediterr\u00e1nea) trial, which was designed to test the effects of the Mediterranean diet on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2009, 4,282 women (ages 60 to 80 and at high risk of cardiovascular disease) were recruited. Women were randomly assigned to the Mediterranean diet supplemented with EVOO (n=1,476), the Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts (n=1,285) or the control diet with advice to reduce their dietary intake of fat (n=1,391).\n\nThe women were an average age of 67.7 years old, had an average body mass index of 30.4, most of them had undergone menopause before the age of 55 and less than 3 percent used hormone therapy. During a median follow-up of nearly five years, the authors identified 35 confirmed incident (new) cases of malignant breast cancer.\n\nThe authors report that women eating a Mediterranean diet supplemented with EVOO showed a 68 percent (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio of 0.32) relatively lower risk of malignant breast cancer than those allocated to the control diet. Women eating a Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts showed a nonsignificant risk reduction compared with women in the control group.\n\nThe authors note a number of limitations in their study including that breast cancer was not the primary end point of the trial for which the women were recruited; the number of observed breast cancer cases was low; the authors do not have information on an individual basis on whether and when women in the trial underwent mammography; and the study cannot establish whether the observed beneficial effect was attributable mainly to the EVOO or to its consumption within the context of the Mediterranean diet.\n\n\"The results of the PREDIMED trial suggest a beneficial effect of a MeDiet [Mediterranean diet] supplemented with EVOO in the primary prevention of breast cancer. Preventive strategies represent the most sensible approach against cancer. The intervention paradigm implemented in the PREDIMED trial provides a useful scenario for breast cancer prevention because it is conducted in primary health care centers and also offers beneficial effects on a wide variety of health outcomes. Nevertheless, these results need confirmation by long-term studies with a higher number of incident cases,\" the authors conclude.\n\nIn a related editor's note, Mitchell H. Katz, M.D., a deputy editor of JAMA Internal Medicine, writes: \"Of course, no study is perfect. This one has a small number of outcomes (only 35 incident cases of breast cancer), the women were not all screened for breast cancer with mammography, they were not blinded to the type of diet they were receiving, and all were white, postmenopausal and at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Still, consumption of a Mediterranean diet, which is based on plant foods, fish and extra virgin olive oil, is known to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and is safe. It may also prevent breast cancer. We hope to see more emphasis on Mediterranean diet to reduce cancer and cardiovascular disease and improve health and well-being.\"\n\nEditor's Note: Authors made conflict of interest and funding/support disclosures.

These are early results, but if replicated may mean that treatment of some mental health problems could benefit from the inclusion of dietary advice. This is presented at the ECNP Conference in Barcelona.\n\nBipolar Disorder (which used to be called 'manic depression') is characterised by episodes of mood swings, between being very up or very down with periods in between the two extremes. The fact that there are two opposite sets of symptoms means that finding an effective treatment is difficult. While current medications are useful, they are better at targeting mania symptoms (the 'up' phase), leaving a lack of effective treatment for people experiencing depressive episodes.

Participants received the study medication in addition to any stable treatments they were already receiving. Researchers measured BMI at the beginning of the study, and then measured depression and how a person is able to function in their day to day life. Researchers also rated whether a participant was improving and, if so, how much, over the next 20 weeks. Participants filled in a questionnaire about what they usually eat over the year and researchers calculated a diet quality score, where good diets included a healthy diet with lots of fruit and vegetables, whereas poorer-quality diets had more saturated fat, refined carbohydrates and alcohol. These types of diets were then categorised as either anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory based on foods that affect inflammation.\n\nMelanie Ashton continued, \"We found that people who had a better-quality diet, a diet with anti-inflammatory properties, or a lower BMI, showed better response to add-on nutraceutical treatment than did those who reported a low-quality diet, or a diet including foods that promote inflammation, or who were overweight.\n\nWhat this means, if these results can be repeated in a larger trial, is that treatment for Bipolar Disorder would need to take into account what a person eats and their weight.\n\nThere are some points we need to note about this study. This is a randomised, controlled trial, but what we found were exploratory outcomes; in other words, it wasn't the main result that we were testing.

Standard stroke treatment relies on powerful blood-thinning medications that break up the clot and restore blood flow to the brain.\n\nBut when those drugs don't work, doctors now can turn to a new catheter-based device that will physically remove the blood clot, said Dr. William Powers, lead author of the updated AHA guidelines and chair of neurology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nThe tool, called an endovascular stent retrieval device, is made up of wire mesh that resembles a tiny ring of chicken wire, Powers said.\n\nSkilled surgeons run the device up through a person's arteries via a catheter, and then open it smack in the middle of a stroke-causing blood clot.\n\n\"If you actually deploy or open one in the middle of a clot, it smooshes out and the clot gets caught in the chicken wire, and then you pull the whole thing out back through the artery,\" Powers said.\n\nThe new guidelines were published June 29 in the journal Stroke.\n\nThe AHA issued its updated guidelines based primarily on the results of six new clinical trials released within the past eight months, Powers said. All of these studies showed that the device can safely and effectively stop a stroke by removing blood clots, he added.\n\nA number of other medical societies have endorsed the AHA's new guidelines, including the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and the Society of Vascular and Interventional Neurology.\n\nAs with other stroke treatments, time is of the essence. The procedure must start within six hours of the onset of a stroke, which means that emergency teams and hospitals will have to move fast, Powers said.\n\nThe guidelines provide added incentive to quickly transfer stroke victims from a local hospital to a major stroke center capable of advanced treatment, said Powers and Dr. David Kandzari, director of interventional cardiology and chief scientific officer for the Piedmont Heart Institute in Atlanta.\n\nLocal hospitals currently are urged to \"drip and ship\" people experiencing a major stroke -- essentially, start an IV drip of the powerful clot-busting drug called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and then ship them by ambulance or helicopter to the nearest comprehensive stroke center for further treatment, Kandzari said.\n\nStent retrieval devices make that quick hospital transfer even more important, since the gadgets provide a crucial backup for tPA but are more tricky to use.\n\n\"These are procedures performed by very specialized individuals,\" Kandzari said. \"They are not regularly performed by cardiologists or radiologists or neurologists. Hospitals must make plans to get people to other centers that are capable of this catheter-based therapy,\" he explained.\n\nPowers said, \"I think what's going to happen is that we will develop systems of rapid triage and rapid transport. A lot of this at this point depends on logistics and manpower. The people who do this are specially trained. You need a lot of special training to get those catheters up into the brain and pull things out.\"\n\nThe guidelines specifically recommend using a stent retrieval device for people who:\n\u2022 Didn't have any significant disability prior to their current stroke.\n\u2022 Received tPA within 4.5 hours of their stroke onset, and can start the procedure within six hours after stroke symptoms started.\n\u2022 Are at least 18 years old, as clinical trials have not been conducted with children.\n\u2022 Have imaging scans that show more than half of the brain on the side of the stroke is not permanently damaged.\n\u2022 Have a clot blocking a large artery supplying blood to the brain.\n\nThat last point is especially important, because the stent retrieval device will not fit into the smaller blood vessels that branch out further into the brain, Powers said.\n\nThe major risk of using the device is that it could tear an artery and cause bleeding in the brain, particularly since it will be used on people who have already received very potent blood thinners, Kandzari said.\n\nBut clinical trials have shown that the risk of brain bleeding for people who received tPA and then went through mechanical clot removal is no greater than for people who just receive the blood thinner, Powers said.\n\n\"The outcomes were uniformly positive in all of the trials,\" he said. \"It's really, really good evidence.\"\n\nFor more about stroke, visit the National Stroke Association.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "This story is not about a single research study, so it is perhaps understandable that it remains general in its comments about benefits.

But you can't make any conclusions about definite health benefits\" based on the study findings, said lead author Suzanna M. Zick, a naturopathic physician and research associate professor at University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor.\n\nThe study, funded by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, was published online Oct. 11 in Cancer Prevention Research.\n\nGinger, an herb, is found in supplements and in many foods such as ginger snaps and Asian dishes. Research has supported its use to treat stomach problems such as nausea and vomiting; the U.S. National Library of Medicine says it's \"likely safe,\" although some people may develop mild side effects.\n\nPrevious research in animals has suggested that ginger can reduce inflammation but isn't potentially toxic to the stomach like aspirin, Zick noted. And scientists have linked chronic inflammation in the gut to colon cancer, suggesting that easing this inflammation could reduce the risk of the disease.\n\nIn the new study, Zick's team randomly assigned 30 people to take pills containing 2 grams of ground ginger root extract or a \"dummy\" placebo pill each day for 28 days. They measured the level of inflammation in the participants' intestines before and after the test period.\n\nThe amount of ginger in the pills is equivalent to 20 grams of raw ginger root, the authors said. That is probably well beyond what most people would eat in their regular diet, Zick noted. As for cost, she said that a month's supply of similar ginger supplements typically runs about $10 to $30.\n\nThe researchers found that the level of inflammation in the subjects who took the ginger pills fell by an average of 28 percent, while staying about the same in those who took the placebo.\n\nIf more funding becomes available, the researchers hope to launch a larger study, Zick said.

Funding for the study was provided by the U.S. National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine.\n\nNeck pain is an extremely common problem. About three-quarters of adults report having neck pain at some point in their lives, according to background information in the study. Neck pain is responsible for millions of health care visits each year, and it can have a negative impact on quality of life.\n\nSpinal manipulation is one type of treatment that's offered for neck pain, and it can be administered by chiropractors, physical therapists, osteopaths and other health care providers, according to the study.\n\nBut, there isn't much evidence for treating neck pain with spinal manipulation. There also isn't a great deal of information on how effective medications or home exercise programs are for treating neck pain, the researchers noted.\n\nBronfort and colleagues thought that spinal manipulation might prove to be more effective than medications or home exercise therapy. To test their hypothesis, they recruited 272 people between the ages of 18 and 65 who had neck pain. Their neck pain had no known cause, such as a trauma or pinched nerve, and the patients been experiencing the pain for between two and 12 weeks when the study began.\n\nThe study volunteers were randomly selected for one of three treatment groups. One group received spinal manipulations over a 12-week period. Each individual was allowed to choose the number of spinal manipulations they felt they needed.\n\nThe second group received medications, both over the counter and prescription, depending on their needs. First-line medications included nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications or acetaminophen (Tylenol). If people didn't get relief from these drugs, narcotic pain medications and muscle relaxants were offered.\n\nThe third group was assigned two one-hour sessions of home exercise. The goal of the home-exercise program was to improve movement in the neck area. Participants were instructed to do the exercises six to eight times per day.\n\nAt the 12th week, 82 percent of people receiving spinal manipulation reported at least a 50 percent reduction in pain, compared with 69 percent of those on medication and 77 percent doing home exercises. Also at week 12, of people receiving spinal manipulation, 32 percent reported feeling a 100 percent reduction in pain, compared with 13 percent on medications and 30 percent doing home exercises.\n\nAt one year, 27 percent of those receiving spinal manipulation said they felt a 100 percent reduction in pain versus 17 percent of those on medications and 37 percent of those doing home exercises.\n\n\"For me, as an ER doctor, this study offers an interesting perspective,\" said Dr. Robert Glatter, an attending physician in emergency medicine at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"It's a small study, but it found that home exercises and spinal manipulation were effective.

Most of them were female, and more than half of them reported experiencing what\u2019s known as aura\n\nOverall, participants had a total of 299 migraines during the study period.\n\nResearchers asked participants to put the device on their upper arm as soon as possible after the start of a migraine and use it for 20 minutes.

But there are currently no curative treatments available for vascular dementia or Alzheimer's disease, the most common causes of dementia. Also, the cells lining the brain's blood vessels are tightly packed, forming a blood-brain barrier that prevents large molecules from crossing into the brain tissue. This limits the types of drugs and cell therapies that could be made available to treat dementia.\n\nShimokawa and his team had conducted previous studies showing that LIPUS improved blood vessel formation in pigs with myocardial ischemia, a condition where there is reduced blood flow to the heart. Other studies have reported that LIPUS increases the production of proteins involved in nerve cell survival and growth, in addition to a role in promoting nerve regeneration. Focusing LIPUS treatment on a region in the brain called the hippocampus, which is involved in memory, has also been found to improve dementia in mice, but the details of how it does this need to be more fully investigated.\n\nThe Tohoku University team wanted to find out if whole-brain rather than focused LIPUS is effective in treating mouse models of dementia, and if it was, what was happening at the molecular levels to achieve this.\n\nThey found that cognitive impairment markedly improved in mice with conditions similar to vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease when LIPUS was applied to the whole brain three times a day for 20 minutes each time.

At least that's what his mother, Glenda Beckham, said.\n\nPriddy is a 17-year-old junior at Stratford High School. He plays trombone and drums for the school band. In his spare time, he recently built a robot with a team of fellow students. His team won the International Rookie All-Star Award at an April robotics competition in Georgia.\n\nPriddy is proud of that achievement, but he is even prouder of something that many youths his age would take for granted: the ability to hear the announcer call his team's name at the awards ceremony. Just two years ago, he feared he might not hear anything again.\n\nToday, Priddy has cochlear implants in both ears and hears rain, birds and the wheels of a shopping basket screeching against the floor in the grocery store. These things are music to his ears.\n\nPriddy was born prematurely and had several lung surgeries before he was 4 years old.\n\n\"They told me that, if he lived, he would be totally deaf and totally blind,\u201d Beckham said. Her son never went blind, but his hearing steadily declined. By the time he was 14, he had lost about 70 percent of his hearing and was wearing hearing aids in both ears.\n\nEven with his hearing loss, Priddy was an excellent student, a gifted musician and well-liked among his classmates.\n\n\"He could always function despite his hearing problems,\u201d said Bill Naberhaus, one of Priddy's high school teachers.\n\nNaberhaus also suffered from extreme hearing loss, a result of long-term exposure to loud noises. \"I was notorious for being the hard-of-hearing teacher, the butt of many jokes,\u201d he said. \"But I didn't need to hear perfectly to be a good teacher.\u201d\n\nIt was when Priddy's hearing started a rapid decline his freshman year that he decided to visit Dr. Wayne Berryhill, a neurotologist at OU Physicians who specializes in cochlear implants. Berryhill explained how the implants function and their possible risks.\n\nAccording to Cochlear.com, the implant works by picking up sound through tiny microphones on a sound processor and converting the sound into digital signals.\n\nThe implant uses those signals to stimulate hearing nerves in the inner ear and replicate the sound.\n\nOnce the internal device is surgically implanted, the patient has to wait four to six week to heal before the device is turned on. It is then that the patient will either hear sounds or not.\n\nBerryhill said the cost of the implant and surgery is in excess of $60,000, but it is covered by most insurance companies as well as Medicare and Medicaid. He warns people that there is a risk the implant will not work and that they may need to have it replaced if it stops working. But the risks are low, he said, and most people who are good candidates for the implant will react positively to it.\n\n\"I was still scared to death,\u201d Priddy said. \"I had no idea what to expect.\u201d\n\nDespite his fears, within a few weeks, Priddy was in the operating room, nervously anticipating the implant surgery on his right ear.\n\nAfter the surgery, Priddy awoke and could hear nothing with his right ear.\n\n\"Right then, I thought, \u2018Oh, why did I do this?'\u201d he said. \"I wasn't even really worried about the deafness because it was hurting so bad. The pain was so excruciating at that moment.\u201d\n\nBut the deafness typically results after the device is implanted because it has yet to be turned on.\n\nWhen Priddy's implant was turned on six weeks later, he couldn't decipher the sounds he was hearing, but he was definitely hearing them.\n\n\"The first things that you hear are random little noises, buzzing, like you would hear from a computer when you get a cell phone close to it,\u201d he said. \"Eventually, the sound literally meshed together and started sounding like the teacher from \u2018Charlie Brown' \u2014 \u2018wah wah wah wah.'\u201d\n\nBecause the sounds generated by cochlear implants are different from sounds received naturally by the ear, it takes time to learn to interpret what they mean. But within a month or so, things started clearing up, and over the course of the next year, Priddy adapted to the implant.\n\nEventually, he decided to get another cochlear implant in his left ear. He was nervous about this because, being left-handed, he favors his left ear and was worried that he wouldn't be able to do one of his favorite pastimes: talking on the telephone. (To girls, late at night, his mother jokingly said.)\n\nBut Priddy adapted quickly to his second implant and can now talk on the telephone all he wants. He has never heard the world better.\n\n\"I am most happy to hear my music,\u201d he said. In the school band, Priddy always had to play music by feel and vibration. Now, he hears the melodies and harmonies just as well as his bandmates. He has become more active in clubs, including his robotics team. And he has excelled academically; he is a straight-A student.\n\n\"After his implant, he just blossomed,\u201d Naberhaus said. \"I would say that hearing better kind of completes your personality, and I think Ethan became a complete personality once his hearing came online.\u201d\n\nAfter witnessing Priddy's miraculous results, Naberhaus was inspired to shrug off his image as the hard-of-hearing teacher and get a cochlear implant.\n\n\"Now, I can hear my grandchildren,\u201d Naberhaus said. \"We love purple martins and other birds around, and I can hear them now, which I couldn't in the past. They sound different, but that's better than not hearing them at all.\u201d\n\nPriddy said that from his experience as a cochlear implant recipient, he has learned many valuable lessons about himself and the world around him. He plans to one day follow in the footsteps of his new hero, Berryhill, the doctor who changed his life. In the meantime, he hopes to inspire others like him to get cochlear implants.\n\n\"It's going to completely change your life.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story does a nice job of describing how the world might sound and come alive after a cochlear implant operation, but it lacks any quantitative estimate of benefit.

Now he and his colleagues are testing to see whether hip patients also can benefit from it.\n\nIt is much less invasive than a knee or hip replacement, and typically is performed on an outpatient basis, Vasileff said.\n\nThe procedure involves a smaller incision than joint replacement surgery, so there's less risk of infection, and a quicker recovery time that means fewer of the side effects associated with being bedridden, Vasileff said.\n\nHowever, subchondroplasty is only feasible in a narrow range of patients. Those with full-blown bone-on-bone arthritis or joint pain caused by damage to the cartilage and ligaments will get little to no relief from the procedure, Vasileff said.\n\n\"People who have significant arthritis where the cartilage itself is damaged and thinned, this isn't going to fix the arthritis,\" Vasileff said. \"But there are some people who may have some issues with the bone and mild arthritis. In these patients who might otherwise have needed a knee or hip replacement to deal with that, this could be an alternative.\"\n\nSoftware engineer Ben Wallace underwent subchondroplasty in November to help shore up a damaged hip.\n\n\"The end of September I noticed I was really struggling to move around my left leg very well,\" said Wallace, who lives in Columbus, Ohio. Imaging scans revealed a hip in very bad shape, with a misshapen femur.\n\nA five-hour surgery cleaned up the femur and bolstered the bone with cement.\n\n\"It's been going really great. I'm better than what they expected. One week after surgery I was off the crutches, walking on my own,\" Wallace said.\n\n\"I figured I'm going to have a fake hip in there at the age of 30, which was very depressing,\" Wallace explained. \"The fact I was able to keep all my bones and joints in there was quite a surprise.\"\n\nSubchondroplasty has shown solid potential, but orthopedic surgeon Dr. Matthew Hepinstall is concerned that it might be \"oversold\" to desperate patients who want to avoid joint replacement surgery.\n\n\"The claims that are being made are not evidence-based yet, although they are intellectually appealing,\" said Hepinstall. He is associate director of the Center for Joint Preservation & Reconstruction at Lenox Hill Hospital, in New York City.\n\n\"It's just important not to oversell this,\" he added.\n\nThe best candidates for the procedure are patients who still have some cartilage protecting their joint, but have somehow \"overloaded\" and injured the bone, causing swelling and pain, Hepinstall said.\n\n\"If you inject this substance into the bone, you're basically providing internal support, a scaffold protecting the bone. That can theoretically reduce bone pain,\" Hepinstall noted.\n\n\"The appealing thing about it is instead of going in and resurfacing a damaged joint, you're injecting something to help the bone, but keeping the patient's own anatomy,\" Hepinstall continued.\n\n\"But there's a very narrow window of patients who are good ideal candidates for this, who basically have a real overload of their bone causing severe enough pain to warrant a surgical procedure, but also have healthy enough cartilage that doing something about the bone swelling is going to alleviate the majority of their pain,\" he stressed.\n\n\"We don't want to send the message to people who have bone-on-bone, with big bone spurs and limited range of motion that they're all of a sudden going to get relief from injecting a little bit of cement into their bone,\" Hepinstall said. \"This is for people who have basically a normal joint that has normal range of motion and normal stability, just a little thinning of the cartilage.\"\n\nFor more on knee pain, visit the Arthritis Foundation.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Beyond serving as a \u201cless invasive,\u201d outpatient alternative to joint replacement surgery, there was no discussion about how to quantify these benefits.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "The spread of some sexually transmitted infections could potentially be dramatically reduced by instructing people who have had unprotected sex to take antibiotics within 24 hours after the intercourse, a new study suggests.\n\nBut such a strategy, which was tested in a population of men who had frequent unprotected sex with a number of male sex partners, could spark a controversy over the use of antibiotics and the general threat of growing antibiotic resistance.\n\n\u201cMy message with that study would be that we need to do more research to prevent STIs \u2014 because that\u2019s a concern. And this strategy \u2026 could potentially be used,\u201d said Dr. Jean-Michel Molina, head of infectious diseases at Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris and the lead author of the study.\n\nMolina insisted he would never support long-term use of antibiotics to prevent STIs, but said that the approach might be an effective short-term strategy when paired with other control approaches, like more frequent STI testing among high-risk populations.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want this strategy to be used widely in any person, clearly,\u201d Molina said. \u201cBut if you can select a group with a high incidence rate of syphilis or chlamydia, and you want to try to reduce the rate of syphilis quite quickly in this group of people, you may think that this strategy could be used for a couple of months.\u201d\n\nRates of syphilis in particular have risen steadily in recent years; the rate in 2015-2016 \u2014 8.7 cases per 100,000 people \u2014 was the highest since 1993, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. The rate of infection increased in every age group over the age of 15, in both men and women, and in all ethnic groups.\n\nMolina\u2019s study was recently published by the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was one of its funders.\n\nThe researchers randomly assigned 232 men to one of two groups. One of the groups was given antibiotics \u2014 the drug doxycycline \u2014 to take if they had unprotected sex. They were told to take two pills per encounter, and no more than six in a week, ideally within 24 hours and no later than 72 hours after the intercourse. In reality, the median use among the men was about 6.8 pills per month.\n\nThe men were tested regularly for STIs, and in the nine or so months they were followed, the rates of some sexually transmitted infections fell dramatically in the treatment group. The overall reduction of all STIs was 47 percent, but that average was dragged down by the fact that doxycycline doesn\u2019t cure gonorrhea.\n\nThere was, however, a 70 percent reduction in chlamydia infections and cases of syphilis decreased by 73 percent. The authors noted, however, that the study length was short and they can\u2019t tell if the strategy would work as well over the long term.\n\nThe results can\u2019t be taken in isolation, others experts warned. Using doxycycline this way could drive the bacteria that cause the infections to develop resistance to the drug, warned Dr. Brad Spellberg, an infectious diseases specialist and chief medical officer at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center in Los Angeles.\n\nSpellberg also said people who used the drug this way would be exposing the bacteria they have in their gastro-intestinal tracts \u2014 their own gut flora \u2014 to regular doses of doxycycline. And those bacteria too could develop resistance to the drug, leading to a host of other health problems.\n\nThe full picture of the knock-on effects of exposing your gut flora to antibiotics is still coming into focus, said Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics, and Policy and a leading voice on the dangers of mounting antibiotic resistance. He noted a recent report in the journal Science revealed that some cancer immunotherapy drugs worked less well in people who had recently taken antibiotics.\n\nMolina noted that antibiotic resistance to doxycycline has not been seen in chlamydia or syphilis, despite the fact that the drug has been used to treat these infections for decades. Still, he said the possibility it could arise cannot be discounted.\n\nA commentary published with the study argued that reducing infection rates in men who have sex with men and who are highly sexually active might lower STI infection rates more generally in a community.\n\nAuthors Christopher Fairley and Eric Chow, of Australia\u2019s Melbourne Sexual Health Center at Monash University, said pressure from patients to be given doxycycline on a preventative basis might be substantial, given that the drug is also prescribed in six-month courses to treat acne. Like Molina and his co-authors, they said STI preventive use at this point is premature.\n\nLaxminarayan did not dismiss the notion of this type of use out of hand, however. \u201cI certainly think that for a small subset of the population, if this helps prevent syphilis, then it certainly is worth exploring further,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he said additional studies should be conducted first to try to get a better picture of the potential consequences of using doxycycline this way, including the risk of resistance developing, the potential that it might further erode condom use, and any other unintended consequences.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story gives some relative reductions, but doesn\u2019t provide enough comparative data to give readers the scope of the benefits.

Although it notes that the study participants were \u201cmen who had frequent unprotected sex with a number of male sex partners,\u201d the story does not make clear just how unusual the men in the study were. For example, while the story reports that syphilis rates for the general US population have risen to almost 9 per 100,000 during a year, the syphilis infection rate in the control group was 11 percent (that is, 11 per 100, not 100,000) over 9 months; a rate that is more than 1,000 times the rate in the general population.

But doctors do not always want to run the risks that can be associated with that technique, and the leading candidates for less invasive assessment are CT and MRI.\n\nCT is a scanning technique using X-rays that produce a set of slice-by-slice heart images, up to 16 slices, depending on the power of the machine. MRI uses a powerful magnetic field and pulses of radiowave energy to create images.\n\nThe German researchers looked at results of 109 published studies of noninvasive heart artery imaging, including 89 that used CT and 20 that used MRI and involving 8,505 people. In the studies of people with suspected coronary artery disease, CT proved to be 97 percent sensitive, compared with 87 percent sensitivity for MRI exams, the analysis found. Sensitivity rates the ability of a test to correctly identify people who have a particular disease.\n\n\"This article holds no surprises whatever,\" said Dr. Uwe Joseph Schoepf, a professor of radiology and cardiology at the Medical University of South Carolina. \"This is really something that is sort of common trade knowledge.\"\n\nIndeed, CT and MRI are not contenders in clinical practice but are used for different reasons to make different assessments, Schoepf said. \"It is a question of what specific question you are looking to answer,\" he said.\n\nCT is the preferred noninvasive technology for assessing the condition of heart arteries, whether there is narrowing that might end with the total blockage that causes a heart attack, Schoepf said. \"MRI is not in current use to look at coronary artery disease,\" he said. \"We use MRI angiography if we are interested in heart muscle, as when there are congenital heart abnormalities in children. The strength of MRI is that it shows tissue configuration.\"\n\nThat difference helps explain why there are so few studies doing head-to-head comparison of CT versus MRI, he said. The German analysis found only five such studies.\n\nDr. Ricardo Cury, director of cardiac MRI and CT at Baptist Cardiac & Vascular Institute in Miami and a consultant radiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, said that the \"meta-analysis demonstrates a knowledge that we have accumulated for the past several years.\"\n\n\"For imaging of the cardiac arteries, CT is more robust,\" Cury said. \"We perform MRI on a clinical basis more for functional assessment, as opposed to looking at the coronary arteries.\"\n\nThough that difference is well established among radiologists, the new study may be of assistance in the general medical community, including general cardiologists, because \"it summarizes the advantages of CT at this point in time,\" he said.\n\nIndeed, CT appears to be better for assessment of coronary artery disease, matched against not only MRI but other methods, such as echocardiography, he said.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic has more on CT, MRI and similar tests.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story does provide some important details on the meta-analysis, including the number of studies and patients, as well as sensitivity results.

According to the\u00a0published study, these figures are for the overall population in the meta-analysis, which includes those with suspected OR known disease, including those with heart attacks.

(Jan. 2, 2018) - In just four months, high-doses of vitamin D reduce arterial stiffness in young, overweight/obese, vitamin-deficient, but otherwise still healthy African-Americans, researchers say.\n\nRigid artery walls are an independent predictor of cardiovascular- related disease and death and vitamin D deficiency appears to be a contributor, says Dr. Yanbin Dong, geneticist and cardiologist at the Georgia Prevention Institute at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University.\n\nSo researchers looked at baseline and again 16 weeks later in 70 African-Americans ages 13-45 - all of whom had some degree of arterial stiffness - taking varying doses of the vitamin best known for its role in bone health.\n\nIn what appears to be the first randomized trial of its kind, they found that arterial stiffness was improved by vitamin D supplementation in a dose-response manner in this population, they write in the journal PLOS ONE.\n\nOverweight/obese blacks are at increased risk for vitamin D deficiency because darker skin absorbs less sunlight - the skin makes vitamin D in response to sun exposure - and fat tends to sequester vitamin D for no apparent purpose, says Dong, the study's corresponding author.\n\nParticipants taking 4,000 international units - more than six times the daily 600 IUs the Institute of Medicine currently recommends for most adults and children - received the most benefit, says Dr. Anas Raed, research resident in the MCG Department of Medicine and the study's first author.\n\nThe dose, now considered the highest, safe upper dose of the vitamin by the Institute of Medicine, reduced arterial stiffness the most and the fastest: 10.4 percent in four months. \"It significantly and rapidly reduced stiffness,\" Raed says.\n\nTwo thousand IUs decreased stiffness by 2 percent in that timeframe. At 600 IUs, arterial stiffness actually increased slightly - .1 percent - and the placebo group experienced a 2.3 percent increase in arterial stiffness over the timeframe.\n\nThey used the non-invasive, gold standard pulse wave velocity to assess arterial stiffness. Reported measures were from the carotid artery in the neck to the femoral artery, a major blood vessel, which supplies the lower body with blood. The American Heart Association considers this the primary outcome measurement of arterial stiffness.\n\nWhen the heart beats, it generates a waveform, and with a healthy heart and vasculature there are fewer and smaller waves. The test essentially measures the speed at which the blood is moving, and in this case, fast is not good, Raed says.\n\n\"When your arteries are more stiff, you have higher pulse wave velocity, which increases your risk of cardiometabolic disease in the future,\" says Raed.\n\nThe varying doses, as well as the placebo participants took, were all packaged the same so neither they or the investigators knew which dose, if any, they were getting until the study was complete. Both placebo and supplements were given once monthly - rather than daily at home - at the GPI to ensure consistent compliance.\n\nDong was also corresponding author on a study published in 2015 in the journal BioMed Central Obesity that showed, in this same group of individuals, both 2,000 and 4,000 IUs restored more desirable vitamin D blood levels of 30 nanograms per milliliter.\n\nThe 4,000 upper-limit dose restored healthy blood level quicker - by eight weeks - and was also better at suppressing parathyroid hormone, which works against vitamin D's efforts to improve bone health by absorbing calcium, they reported.\n\nWhile heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, blacks have higher rates of cardiovascular disease and death than whites and the disease tends to occur earlier in life. The authors write that arterial stiffness and vitamin D deficiency might be potential contributors.\n\nWhile just how vitamin D is good for our arteries isn't completely understood, it appears to impact blood vessel health in many ways. Laboratory studies have shown that mice missing a vitamin D receptor have higher activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, says Raed. Activation of this system increases blood vessel constriction, which can contribute to arterial stiffness. Vitamin D also can suppress vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, activation of garbage-eating macrophages and calcification formation, all of which can thicken blood vessel walls and hinder flexibility. Vitamin D also reduces inflammation, an underlying mechanism for obesity related development of coronary artery disease, says Raed.\n\nNow it's time to do a larger-scale study, particularly in high-risk populations, and follow participants' progress for longer periods, Dong and Raed say. \"A year would give us even more data and ideas,\" Raed adds.\n\nDong notes that pulse wave velocity and blood pressure measures are complimentary but not interchangeable. \"We think maybe in the future, when you go to your physician, he or she might check your arterial stiffness as another indicator of how healthy you are,\" Raed says.\n\nThere were no measurable differences in weight or blood pressure measurements over the 16-week study period.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine currently recommends a daily intake of 800 IUs of vitamin D for those age 70 and older. For adolescents and adults, they recommend 4,000 IUs as the upper daily limit; 2,000 was a previous upper limit.\n\nMore than 80 percent of Americans, the majority of whom spend their days indoors, have vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency. Dong, an expert in vitamin D and a professor in the MCG Department of Population Health Sciences, says about 15 minutes daily in the \"young\" sun - between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. - but before your skin starts to get pink, is the best source of vitamin D.\n\nFoods like milk, milk products like cheese and yogurt, fatty fish like mackerel and sardines, some greens like kale and collards and fortified cereals also are good sources. The researchers say a vitamin D supplement is an inexpensive and safe option for most of us.", "question": "Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The release quantifies the benefits in each group with this statement: \u201cTwo thousand IUs decreased stiffness by 2 percent in that timeframe.

A difference was only seen in the group that got the highest dose of 4,000 units per day. That distinction was not made clear.\nFurther, what does a 2% decrease in arterial stiffness mean in terms that would matter to a patient? The 2% decrease in reduced stiffness is a proxy or surrogate marker for a health outcome, but not one that tells us the actual impact on patient health.\nOn the plus side, the release explains that the study consisted of 70 participants, and that those taking the most vitamin D showed the greatest reduction in arterial stiffness \u2014 10.4 percent in 4 months \u2014 but it does not say how many participants that was.

It is estimated that the condition affects one in 110 children in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"There is a serious unmet need in the autism world, where diagnosis is currently done by subjective reports, and after the child has missed many developmental milestones,\" said lead researcher Joy Hirsch, a professor of functional neuroradiology, neuroscience and psychology, and director of the Functional MRI Laboratory at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City.\n\n\"It is now possible to develop an objective imaging diagnostic,\" she said. Indeed, the researchers found a difference between autistic brains and typical brains in the level of responsiveness in language areas, Hirsch noted.\n\n\"What we can measure are signals in the brain, in a specific language area, that are depressed in autistic children and normal in typical children,\" she said.\n\nAlthough this study was done with school-aged children and teens, the same test can be done with children as young as 18 months, Hirsch noted. \"We know this technique can be used on young children,\" she said.\n\nThe report was released in the May 31 online edition of Radiology, in advance of publication in the August print issue.\n\nFor the study, 12 children with autism and 15 children without the condition underwent functional MRI (fMRI) exams. Both groups of children ranged in age from 4 to 17 years.\n\nWhile the children were undergoing the fMRI, the researchers played recordings of their parents talking to them and watched for brain activity in areas of the brain responsible for hearing and understanding language.\n\nThe researchers found no differences in the activity in the hearing area of the brain between the two groups. However, in the language comprehension area, there was significantly more activity among typical children than among children with autism, Hirsch's group noted.\n\nTo further test this screening approach, another group of 27 autistic children, aged 5 to 17, underwent fMRI and the researchers were able to identify 26 of them as autistic.\n\nDr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York in Lake Success, said that \"although the investigators did indeed find significant differences on neuroimaging between controls and autistic children, the clinical utility from a diagnostic standpoint is unclear.\"\n\nThere are important limitations to the study, Adesman said.\n\nFor one, this study was done in school-aged children, many of whom were actually teenagers, so it is impossible to know if these differences in neuroimaging would also be found in younger patients, Adesman pointed out.\n\n\"It is during the toddler/preschool years that autism typically presents and needs to be diagnosed,\" he explained.\n\n\"The other major limitation of this study is that the investigators did not look at whether these brain differences are specific to children with autism, or if they would also be seen, for example, in children with language delays who are not autistic,\" Adesman said.\n\nHirsch noted the study is preliminary and, as such, has some limitations. For one, it is not known whether this technique can identify autism across the entire spectrum of the disorder.\n\n\"There are questions about how this varies across the severity of autism. Also, can we distinguish autism from other forms of developmental delay?\" she asked. \"These are things that aren't known.\"\n\nFurther work is needed to refine the test, Hirsch added. \"This is not the diagnostic that you can package and send to all community health centers in the United States.

These drugs work by increasing bone thickness, thereby reducing the risk of fractures, the researchers said.\n\nIn prior studies, bisphosphonates have already been shown to be associated with a reduced odds for breast cancer.\n\n\"These [new] findings are meaningful because they point to a possible protective effect of this class of drugs being relevant to prevention of many different cancers,\" said lead researcher Dr. Gad Rennert, from the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology Faculty of Medicine and chairman of the department of community medicine and epidemiology at the Carmel Medical Center of Clalit Health Services in Haifa, Israel.\n\n\"This is [similar] to the effect that we and others have shown for [cholesterol-lowering] statins,\" he said, noting that \"bisphosphonates and statins share the same metabolic pathway.\"\n\nThe results of the U.S. National Cancer Institute-supported study are published in the Feb. 14 issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\nFor the study, Rennert's team collected data on almost 1,900 postmenopausal women who took part in the Molecular Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer study, which is a population-based trial in northern Israel.\n\nThe researchers found that taking bisphosphonates, mostly Fosamax, for at least a year was associated with a significant 59 percent reduction in relative risk for colorectal cancer.\n\n\"The magnitude of the reduced risk is less important because this is an association study; however, it is very significant after controlling for a dozen other known risk factors,\" Rennert said.\n\nThey took into account factors such as family history, ethnic background, diet, physical activity, weight, vitamin D consumption and the use of other drugs such as aspirin, statins and hormone replacement therapy.\n\nThe findings in this study show that bisphosphonates are associated with a reduced risk of developing colorectal cancer, but they cannot confirm a causal effect -- that is, the study doesn't prove that the use of bisphosphonates is responsible for the lower risk of colorectal cancer.\n\nHowever, the lowered risk of colorectal cancer seen with bisphosphonates may be due to the way the drug acts in the body, which is similar to how cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins work, according to Rennert. These same researchers also found in another study that statin use also reduced the risk of colorectal cancer, he noted.\n\n\"We also found a similar effect last year with risk of breast cancer, which has already been replicated by three other groups,\" Rennert added.\n\nA randomized trial is need to prove that bisphosphonates are protective against colorectal cancer, Rennert said. \"It should be relatively easy, as it seems that all that is needed is a year of treatment to see the effect,\" he said.\n\nThe researchers noted, however, that the risks of using bisphosphonates include the possibility, in rare cases, of osteonecrosis of the jaw (destruction of the jawbone or jaw tissue). Bisphosphonates used for osteoporosis have also been linked to a rare fracture of the thigh, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\n\"The adverse effects profile is of major importance if bisphosphonates are going to be recommended for cancer prevention in healthy people,\" the study authors cautioned.\n\nCommenting on the study, Eric Jacobs, Strategic Director of Pharmacoepidemiology at the American Cancer Society, said that \"the lower risk of colorectal cancer risk seen among bisphosphonate users in this study is intriguing.\"\n\nHowever, these results should be interpreted with caution and require confirmation by additional studies, he said. \"Results from the only other study of bisphosphonate use and colorectal cancer, a recent large study from the United Kingdom, do not support an important protective effect,\" Jacobs noted.\n\nFortunately, there are other proven ways to help lower risk of colorectal cancer, he said. \"In particular, all Americans, 50 or older, should get a screening test so that precancerous polyps can be detected and removed before they turn into cancer.\"\n\nFor more information on colon cancer, visit the American Cancer Society.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The lead says, \u201cPeople who take drugs called bisphosphonates to prevent bone loss may also reduce their risk of developing colorectal cancer by almost 60 percent compared to those not on the drugs, a new study suggests.\u201d What this story and the Reuters Health story failed to do was give the raw numbers that are provided in the study itself.\u00a0The story should have said that 138 women in the non-cancer group took biophosphonates and 97 in the cancer group took them, meaning that 41 women appear to have benefited from taking the drugs.

The procedure, often done to relieve chest pain and to reduce the risk of having or dying from a heart attack, has become one of the most common medical procedures in the United States.\n\n\"The data are compelling,\" said William E. Boden of the University of Buffalo School of Medicine, whose findings were published yesterday by the New England Journal of Medicine to coincide with a presentation at a meeting of the American College of Cardiology in New Orleans. \"We do too many of these procedures.\"\n\nSeveral experts said they expect the findings will prompt a major shift in how doctors treat thousands of patients suffering from heart disease -- the nation's leading cause of death.\n\n\"These findings are pretty explosive,\" said Steven E. Nissen, president of the American College of Cardiology. \"I think this is going to shake things up pretty significantly.\"\n\nThe findings underscore the danger of rushing to adopt a procedure before careful studies have been conducted to fully determine its benefits, Boden and others said.\n\n\"There was just this intuitive belief that it would be beneficial,\" Boden said. \"But no one had ever done a proper randomized trial to see whether it actually improved outcomes. In the meantime, a whole industry has been created around this.\"\n\nThe researchers and others stressed that angioplasty clearly benefits patients who are in the throes of a heart attack or are at very high risk for one. But the findings indicate that for a patient whose condition is stable, medical therapy is just as effective at reducing the major risks. Such patients constitute at least one-third of those undergoing the 1.2 million angioplasties performed each year, and perhaps as much as 85 percent.\n\nSome cardiologists who specialize in the procedures, however, argued that the study did not focus on the sickest patients who are most likely to benefit, and that the main purpose of angioplasty in many is to alleviate chest pain, not to prevent heart attacks.\n\n\"I don't think this is going to cause any huge paradigm shift,\" said Gregory J. Dehmer, president of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions. \"This study was limited to a fairly select group of patients with very stable symptoms.\"\n\nBut Boden said that the study did include patients with moderate to severe heart disease and that many such patients undergo the procedure in the belief it will protect them against heart attacks.\n\nIn the procedure, doctors thread a tiny balloon into clogged arteries, inflate the balloon to clear the blockage, and insert a stent -- a tiny wire lattice strut that props the artery open. The procedure costs about $50,000 and is considered safe, though it does carry some risks.\n\nThe findings come on the heels of questions about the safety of new stents coated with drugs to keep arteries from reclosing. Those concerns had led doctors to curtail their use of the newer devices, and the new findings are expected to have a similar effect on angioplasty overall.\n\n\"There was an overexuberance,\" said William O'Neill, a prominent cardiologist at the University of Miami. \"I think we're getting a midcourse correction.\"\n\nThe findings could also help fuel a resurgence of bypass surgery, which has become far less common with the rise of angioplasty.\n\n\"There was this sense that angioplasty would produce the same result as bypass surgery,\" Nissen said. \"I think this will cause a tilt toward more patients with stable conditions choosing medical therapy and more people who have more severe disease getting bypass surgery, which both relieves symptoms and reduces the risk for heart attack and death.\"\n\nThe new study, which was funded mostly by the Department of Veterans Affairs, involved 2,287 patients at 50 centers in the United States and Canada who had chest pain or other symptoms because one or more major arteries supplying blood to the heart had clogged. Half the patients received standard medical treatment involving medication and lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, eating better and exercising.

The research is also the first to show that diet and lifestyle may play a greater role than genetics in cataract development and severity.\n\nCataracts occur naturally with age and cloud the eye\u2019s lens, turning it opaque. Despite the advent of modern cataract removal surgery, cataracts remain the leading cause of blindness globally.1 Researchers at King\u2019s College London looked at whether certain nutrients from food or supplements could help prevent cataract progression. They also tried to find out how much environmental factors such as diet mattered versus genetics.\n\nThe team examined data from more than 1,000 pairs of female twins from the United Kingdom. Participants answered a food questionnaire to track the intake of vitamin C and other nutrients, including vitamins A, B, D, E, copper, manganese and zinc. To measure the progression of cataracts, digital imaging was used to check the opacity of their lenses at around age 60. They performed a follow-up measurement on 324 pairs of the twins about 10 years later.\n\nDuring the baseline measurement, diets rich in vitamin C were associated with a 20 percent risk reduction for cataract. After 10 years, researchers found that women who reported consuming more vitamin C-rich foods had a 33 percent risk reduction of cataract progression.\n\nGenetic factors accounted for 35 percent of the difference in cataract progression. Environmental factors, such as diet, accounted for 65 percent. These results make the study the first to suggest that genetic factors may be less important in progression of cataract than previously thought. How vitamin C inhibits cataract progression may have to do with its strength as an antioxidant. The fluid inside the eye is normally high in vitamin C, which helps prevents oxidation that clouds the lens. More vitamin C in the diet may increase the amount present in the fluid around the lens, providing extra protection. Researchers noted that the findings only pertain to consuming the nutrient through food and not vitamin supplements.\n\n\u201cThe most important finding was that vitamin C intake from food seemed to protect against cataract progression,\u201d said study author Christopher Hammond, M.D., FRCOphth, professor of ophthalmology at King\u2019s College London. \u201cWhile we cannot totally avoid developing cataracts, we may be able to delay their onset and keep them from worsening significantly by eating a diet rich in vitamin C.\u201d \u201cGenetic and Dietary Factors Influencing the Progression of Nuclear Cataract,\u201d Yonova-Doing, et al.

Brachytherapy also has fewer side effects such as radiation burns.\n\n\"That reduces the potential harm to surrounding organs behind the breast tissue. That was a huge factor in me choosing to do the brachytherapy,\u201d said Cheryl McCartney, 51, a Chouteau Elementary School principal who had brachytherapy done in 2006 at Cancer Treatment Centers of America in Tulsa.\n\nMcCartney had no side effects and remains cancer-free.\n\nThe typical radiation treatment for breast cancer involves about six weeks of daily \"external beam radiation\u201d that treats the entire breast. Not all communities offer radiation treatment, so women often must travel to receive it. Because of the burden, doctors say, many choose to have mastectomies instead.\n\n\"It's a lot shorter, and it's obviously convenient,\u201d said Dr. Doug Kelly, a radiation oncologist with Cancer Treatment Centers. For many women, family and work obligations make a commute to receive treatment a challenge. \"They really have a hard time coming in for six weeks,\u201d he said.\n\nThe shorter treatment duration encouraged McCartney to have brachytherapy. Her first oncologist suggested the traditional approach. After seeking a second opinion, she had the needle method done without having to miss work. She returned twice a day for treatment.\n\n\"It did not disrupt my schedule that week,\u201d she said.\n\nCancer Treatment Centers was among the first to adopt brachytherapy for breast cancer patients a decade ago, Kelly said.\n\n\"Now it's becoming more common and almost standard,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nAlthough there are no large-scale national results, doctors say studies have shown brachytherapy to be as effective as traditional radiation therapy.\n\nOU Physicians Radiologist Dr. Ozer Algan said a national study of brachytherapy's effectiveness compared to treating the entire breast is underway, but it will be several years before results are published.\n\nHowever, he said, \"I think it is becoming more popular, both from a physician perspective but also from a patient perspective. I think most patients want to get their treatment done as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nAlgan said he doesn't extol one technique over the others; all are acceptable depending on the patient.\n\nIn the multiple-catheter method, a doctor places 10 to 20 \"needles\u201d about one centimeter apart around the tumor cavity, and a machine inserts the radioactive pellet. The procedure requires a hospital stay, at the end of which the needles and pellets are removed. Women can then return to work.\n\nIn the balloon-catheter method, also known as Mammosite, a doctor inflates a balloon in the tumor cavity, and a catheter delivers the radioactive pellet.\n\nAlthough standards depend somewhat on doctors' preferences, candidates for breast brachytherapy typically have early-stage tumors with a margin of healthy tissue around the tumor site after removal and minimal or no migration of cancer cells to nearby lymph nodes.\n\n\"You're hopefully killing any stray cancer cells,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nBrachytherapy remains a mainstay of prostate cancer treatment. Oklahomans had some 2,510 new cases of prostate cancer this year.\n\nOU Physicians Urologist Dr. Puneet Sindhwani said doctors are diagnosing prostate cancer earlier; they aren't seeing the advanced-stage or \"hybrid\u201d cancers they saw 15 or 20 years ago.\n\n\"More and more patients are opting for brachytherapy. More and more physicians are offering brachytherapy,\u201d he said.\n\nBecause the prostate is small and tiny shifts in position can make accurately targeting tumors difficult, OU Physicians has software and a real-time machine that allow doctors to place the seeds exactly where they are needed.\n\nWithout the software, doctors must plan where to place the tiny pellets and then recreate the position of the prostate. The computer calculates radiation exposure to nearby nerves and tissue, which is important because overexposure can cause erectile dysfunction and other problems.\n\n\"A five-millimeter distance will make you either overexposed or underexposed,\u201d he explained.\n\nSindhwani has been performing the procedure with the new equipment for about three months.\n\nAlthough long-term data are unavailable, results have been positive.\n\n\"At present time, it seems like they are doing very well,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 50 to 150 pellets become inert metal after losing their radioactivity.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The article includes no data on the benefits of the treatment.\u00a0", "answer": 0}, {"article": "LONDON (Reuters) - An \u201celectronic nose\u201d could be used as a simple breath test to detect lung, breast, bowel and prostate cancers, Israeli scientists said Wednesday.\n\nUsing the sensor to pinpoint chemical variations, the team found they could not only distinguish between healthy and malignant breath but also identify the four different common tumor types.\n\nWhile more work is needed to develop the technology, the early success could lead to the development of a cheap, easy-to-use and portable test to help diagnose cancer earlier.\n\n\u201cIf we can confirm these initial results in large-scale studies, this new technology could become a simple tool for early diagnosis of cancer along with imaging,\u201d said Abraham Kuten of Technion Israel Institute of Technology.\n\nKuten and his colleagues studied the breath of 177 people \u2014 some healthy and some with various types of cancer \u2014 to detect the different chemicals emitted from the surface of cancer cells as they grow.\n\nTheir findings, published in the British Journal of Cancer, build on earlier research published by scientists at the same institute last year showing that a sensor made with gold nanoparticles could detect lung cancer in breath.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": " ", "answer": 0}, {"article": "DALLAS - September 05, 2016 -A new class of drugs called HIF-2 inhibitors is more effective and better tolerated than the standard of care drug sunitinib in treating kidney cancer, researchers with the Kidney Cancer Program at Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center have found.\n\nHIF-2 inhibitors, which grew out of research begun more than 20 years ago at UT Southwestern Medical Center, work by interfering with processes that fuel the growth of cells.\n\nInvestigators conducted a pre-clinical trial in mice transplanted with kidney cancer from over 20 patients and showed that the HIF-2 inhibitor PT2399 controlled cancer in half of the tumors, according to a study published in the journal Nature.\n\n\"This is a completely new treatment for kidney cancer. We want to make HIF-2 inhibitors available to patients and are currently carrying out clinical trials,\" said Dr. James Brugarolas, Director of the Kidney Cancer Program, who is leading an $11 million SPORE grant from the National Cancer Institute seeking to translate new discoveries into novel therapies for kidney cancer patients. Part of the SPORE grant, one of just two directly related to kidney cancer in the nation, is focused on further researching HIF-2 inhibitors.\n\nIn a previous report, Dr. Kevin Courtney, Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine and a coauthor of the current study, reported at the American Association of Clinical Oncology annual meeting that HIF-2 inhibitors were safe in patients and had activity even in heavily pretreated patients. In the study in Nature, investigators show that HIF-2 inhibition was able to control metastatic kidney cancer even after 7 lines of prior therapy. See video.\n\nThe findings show that HIF-2 is a promising target to combat kidney cancer, said Dr. Brugarolas, senior author and a Virginia Murchison Linthicum Scholar in Medical Research at UT Southwestern.\n\nNearly 400,000 Americans are now living with a diagnosis of kidney cancer and more than 60,000 people are expected to be diagnosed with kidney cancer this year, according to the National Cancer Institute. Texas has the fifth highest rate of this cancer in the U.S.\n\nHIFs or hypoxia-inducible factors, like HIF-2, allow the body's cells to adjust to low-oxygen environments. HIFs activate programs that promote the development of blood vessels, facilitate oxygen delivery and promote efficient nutrient utilization. Kidney cancer cells hijack the same system to fuel their growth.\n\nHIF-2 inhibitors work by suppressing the effects of HIF-2 which include downregulating an important protein called VEGF that promotes the formation of blood vessels needed for tumors to grow.\n\n\"Unlike existing VEGF inhibitors, the HIF-2 inhibitor blocks VEGF only in the cancer and therefore does not cause cardiac toxicity or hypertension,\" Dr. Brugarolas explained.\n\nIn the Nature study, researchers compared the two drugs head to head and found that the HIF-2 inhibitor was more active than sunitinib and that it was active against tumors progressing on sunitinib.\n\n\"Furthermore, it was also better tolerated. As sometimes happens in patients, mice on sunitinib were sickly and lost weight, whereas mice on the HIF-2 inhibitor gained weight while on the study,\" he said.\n\nResearchers surprisingly found a subset of tumors that do not respond to the drug, but were able to identify biomarkers that, once verified, would help determine which patients are more likely to benefit from HIF-2 therapies.\n\n\"HIF-2 is believed to be the most important driver of kidney cancer. Traditionally, proteins like HIF-2 were disregarded as drug targets because their shape made it nearly impossible to design drugs against them,\" Dr. Brugarolas said. \"The approaches we have taken pave the way for identifying drug candidates for other proteins that have traditionally been considered undruggable.\"\n\nHIF-2 also appears significant in other types of cancer, including deadly brain cancers called glioblastomas and non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type of lung malignancy.\n\nHow HIF-2 came to be\n\nIn 1997, UT Southwestern researchers Dr. Steven McKnight, Chairman of Biochemistry, and molecular geneticist Dr. David Russell, Vice Provost and Dean of Basic Research, led research discovering and describing the protein encoded by the EPAS1 gene, also known as HIF-2\u03b1, the main HIF-2 component. Over the course of a decade, the laboratories of Dr. Richard Bruick, Professor of Biochemistry, holder of the Michael L. Rosenberg Scholar in Biomedical Research, and a coauthor of the current study, and Dr. Kevin Gardner, Adjunct Professor of Biochemistry, solved the structure of HIF-2\u03b1.\n\nBy 2009, researchers had identified a \"sweet spot\" where drugs could bind and shut down HIF-2 activity. Using the Simmons Cancer Center's High-Throughput Screening, scientists tested more than 200,000 chemicals to see which ones could interfere with HIF-2, identifying several potential drug-like compounds. The most promising compounds were licensed to Peloton Therapeutics, Inc., a biotech firm co-founded by Dr. McKnight and based at UT Southwestern's BioCenter campus. In 2014, the first HIF-2 inhibitor, an oral drug known as PT2385, entered clinical trials in patients with advanced or metastatic renal clear cell carcinoma.\n\nHIF-2 inhibitors also are the target of UTSW's recent $11 million SPORE (Specialized Program of Research Excellence) award. Investigators will further biomarkers to identify patients most likely to respond to the HIF-2 inhibitor, as well as to anticipate ways in which the tumor may evade the drug's impact.\n\nUT Southwestern's SPORE program involves four innovative disease and clinical research teams targeting adult and pediatric kidney cancer. Other UTSW SPORE investigators are looking at the function of a gene that identifies a cluster of particularly aggressive tumors, in hopes of identifying vulnerabilities that can be targeted with drugs; examining kidney cancer metabolism to distinguish aggressive from less active tumors, potentially yielding a tailored treatment approach; and evaluating novel subtypes of childhood kidney cancer.\n\nThe Nature research was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health including the SPORE; Peloton Therapeutics, Inc.; and the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas; the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (Center for Translational Medicine); National Natural Science Foundation of China; and philanthropy, including the Tom Green Memorial fund.\n\nMore than 30 researchers contributed to the study, including Dr. Payal Kapur, Associate Professor of Pathology; Dr. Ivan Pedrosa, Associate Professor of Radiology in the Advanced Imaging Research Center who holds the Jack Reynolds, M.D., Chair in Radiology; Dr. Xiankai Sun, Associate Professor of Radiology in the Advanced Imaging Research Center who holds the Dr. Jack Krohmer Professorship in Radiation Physics; Dr. Xian-Jin Xie, Professor of Clinical Sciences; Dr. Yang Xie, Associate Professor of Clinical Sciences; Dr. Tae Hyun Hwang, Assistant Professor of Clinical Sciences; Dr. Guiyang Hao, Assistant Professor of Radiology; Dr. Eugene Frenkel, Professor of Internal Medicine and Radiology who holds the Raymond D. and Patsy R.

Like every new study of prostate cancer, the results need to be carefully parsed.\n\nFirst, the study results, which appear in this week's New England Journal of Medicine. It's actually an update of a 2008 report, with an additional three years of data on the nearly 700 men who volunteered for the trial up to 15 years ago. All of them had early-stage prostate cancer at the beginning.\n\nThe study found 38 percent fewer prostate cancer deaths among men randomly assigned to the surgery group versus those in what the Swedes called the watchful-waiting group. Men who had surgery had 41 percent lower risk of their cancer spreading throughout the body, and 66 percent less risk of growth within the prostate.\n\nThe survival benefits were restricted to men under 65. For this group, surgery saved one life for every seven men who had prostatectomies \u2014 considered a favorable ratio. And it applied to men with tumors considered low-risk, meaning they have a relatively low Gleason score, a marker of tumor aggressiveness.\n\n\"Our findings show that some tumors that are considered to be low-risk at diagnosis do pose a threat to life, especially if they are not surgically removed,\" the study authors write.\n\nSo is this a slam-dunk for radical prostatectomy? Game over?\n\nFar from it. In an editorial accompanying the study, Dr. Dr. Matthew Smith of Massachusetts General Hospital makes some important points.\n\nFirst, only about 1 in 20 men in the Swedish study had a prostate cancer diagnosis based on a high PSA level. Almost 90 percent had tumors their doctors could feel on digital rectal exams. But in the U.S., most prostate cancers are identified by PSA screening, and less than half have palpable tumors.\n\nThis is important, because experts believe many prostate tumors found by PSA are likely to be slow-growing \u2014 perhaps so slow they will never cause a problem before the man dies of something else.\n\nSo \"low risk\" in the Swedish study means higher-risk than the current \"low risk\" men diagnosed in the United States. By the way, 9 out of 10 prostate cancers in the U.S. these days is considered low risk.\n\nSecond, the Swedish study compared radical prostatectomy to watchful waiting. And Smith points out that \"watchful waiting\" does not mean the same thing as \"active surveillance.\"\n\n\"Watchful waiting means we're not going to treat you now and if you progress clinically, we'll treat you with hormone therapy \u2013 not with curative intent,\" Smith tells Shots.\n\n\"Active surveillance means observing the patient in a proactive way, with regularly scheduled biopsies,\" he adds. If there's a sign the cancer is progressing, doctors currently would treat with intent to cure, using surgery, radiation or both.\n\nSmith makes another point: Both surgical techniques and radiation therapy technology have improved since the Swedish study was done. So there's reason to think men followed with active surveillance and treated when necessary would fare better than the \"watchful waiting\" group in the newly published study.\n\nUnfortunately, there haven't been any large studies in which prostatectomy and radiation therapy have been compared in patients with early-stage prostate cancer who have been randomly assigned to one or the other.\n\nTwo such studies are underway. Results are some years off. But Smith warns against assuming those results will settle the question of how men with early-stage prostate cancer should be treated.\n\n\"There will always be questions, and an ongoing need to individualize therapy,\" he says.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story reported only the relative difference in the number of men in each treatment group who died during the follow-up period. \u00a0For readers to understand what the real difference in risk is, information about the absolute difference in risk needs to be reported.

In July 2010, an FDA panel voted 7-to-1 to approve the use of Brilinta for U.S. patients undergoing angioplasty or stenting to open blocked arteries, but the approval process is still ongoing.\n\nThe panel's recommendation was based in part on prior findings from this study, called the Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial.\n\nIn this latest analysis of PLATO findings, researchers found that patients who took Brilinta with low-dose aspirin were 16 percent less likely than those who took Plavix with low-dose aspirin to have a heart attack or stroke, or to die within a year.\n\nThe findings were reported Monday in an American Heart Association online conference.\n\nOne expert said the new information is valuable.\n\n\"The study highlights that if one chooses to use ticagrelor in subjects with acute coronary syndromes, it would be logical to use aspirin 81 milligrams per day (and not 325 mg daily),\" said Dr. Jeffrey S.

Most importantly, we think the take-home message of the study was too oversimplified. The headline claims that Brilinta \u201cBeats Plavix When Paired With Low-Dose Aspirin.\u201d In fact, this study was a geographic analysis to explain why Brilinta wasn\u2019t better than Plavix in the US, unlike in other countries, and the lead conclusion was: \u201cThe regional interaction could arise from chance alone.\u201d Next, it says that the aspirin dose was \u201ca possible explanation.\u201d In fact, since last year the dose of\u00a0aspirin has been suggested\u00a0as a possible explanation for the regional differences in Brilinta\u2019s effects, and that hypothesis has generated controversy. This new study is important to raise our antennae and spur new research, but it wasn\u2019t designed to prove the effect of aspirin.\nOf course, the article\u2019s take-home message is the same one that many in the field (including the FDA) may derive from this study. The aspirin finding is most relevant to current practice, both for the use of ticagrelor globally now and perhaps soon in the US. It\u2019s also valuable for thinking about aspirin in this setting in general. However, we think the \u00a0context should not be boiled off from the message. \nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind the limitations of this reported benefit, as we discussed under Evaluate the Quality of Evidence.

Half of the group was assigned to naltrexone and the other half to bupenorphine.\n\nSix percent of those enlisted to use buprenorphine were unable to start their treatment, whereas 28% of those assigned to naltrexone dropped out before starting the therapy.\n\nThat hurdle is attributed to the fact that in order to start naltrexone, a person has to have detoxed or not used opioids for several days, whereas a user can transition from opioids to buprenorphine seamlessly. \"If you're currently opiate-dependent ... (naltrexone) takes more work,\" said Dr. Joshua Lee , the lead author of the study, who studies opioid addiction behavior and treatment at New York University.\n\nOnce on either of the medications, people fared equally well. \"They tend to stay on medications about the same rate. They report good outcomes, avoiding heroin use,\" Lee said. However, both groups also reported similar challenges staying with the regimens: Just 40% of patients still used the drugs after 24 weeks.\n\nWhat was important, Lee said, was for opioid addicts as well as treatment providers to understand that addiction isn't one-size-fits-all. \"Much like you would expect if the doctor told you 'you have cancer' or 'you have diabetes,' then there are different ways you could pursue treatment,\" he said.\n\nPublic health experts consider medicated-assisted treatment the gold standard of opioid addiction treatment. It combines medication with counseling to help addicts wean off of high opioid use. Public health experts say it can help solve the staggering opioid overdose epidemic.\n\nMethadone may be the best-known form of medicated-assisted treatment, but it requires patients to have the drug administered daily in a clinic. Two other options have become increasingly popular: buprenorphine, which can be taken outside a clinic, and naltrexone, which is administered monthly.\n\nLegally prescribed opioid drugs like oxycodone and hydrocodone work in the same manner as illicit drugs like heroin. They all chemically bind to the opioid receptors in the brain to help dull pain and, in some people, provide euphoria.\n\nThe body also produces natural opioids, but the more narcotics a person takes, the less opioids the body naturally produces. Without the opioids, people can go into withdrawal, all contributing to a cycle of dependency.\n\n\"To feel normal, they need opiates on those receptors,\" Banta-Green said. Buprenorphine and methadone, which are opioids, work by reducing people's cravings. \"They bind to prevent withdrawal, giving some opiate effect,\" he said.\n\nOn the other hand, naltrexone works by chemically blocking those receptors, which is why someone needs to detox before starting the regimen. \"You're not getting an opiate effect,\" Banta-Green explained.\n\nIf a person takes an opioid while on naltrexone, it is unlikely they will feel any opioid sensation. If a person is using opioids and takes naltrexone, it can induce a feeling of withdrawal. \"It addresses craving in a different way. The person knows they can't use,\" he said.\n\nSo, for example, a person who is actively using opioids and can't manage the withdrawals may be better suited for buprenorphine, while someone coming from a facility where he or she has detoxed and who doesn't want to use opioids may be better suited for naltrexone.\n\nWhat is key, said Dr. Miriam Komaromy, is meeting a patient where they are and understanding what best meets their needs.\n\nAddiction \"is an incredibly deadly disease,\" said Komaromy, an addiction specialist at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center. And as public policymakers, prisons and drug courts play a larger role in treating addiction, public health experts like Komaromy argue that it is imperative to look at \"evidence-based ways instead of having a moralistic view.\"\n\nBanta-Green says he talks to a lot of judges who are trying to understand addiction treatment. \"I say this a lot to judges: You can't just offer one medication. Just like any other medication, some people are going to feel right with one as opposed to the other.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story describes duration of staying on the treatments and rates of relapse, reporting that the rates are roughly equal.

This is huge,\u201d said Regina Vidaver, executive director of the National Lung Cancer Partnership.\n\nThe researchers said their findings could save thousands of lives. Lung cancer kills 1.2 million people a year globally and it will kill 157,000 people in the United States alone this year, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nThe trial of more than 53,000 current and former heavy smokers, aged 55 to 74, found the \u201cspiral\u201d CT scans apparently catch tumors before they have spread.\n\n\u201cTo me this is a game changer,\u201d Vidaver said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe will have what breast cancer has now, which is a lot of survivors.\u201d\n\nThe researchers have some caveats. They do not know whether the radiation from the CT scans may raise the risk of cancer, and they do not know what the study means for light smokers, younger people, or those who have never smoked.\n\nIt is also possible the scans will turn up tumors that would never have killed the patients, and that some people will undergo unnecessary surgery if they are screened.\n\nIt is not clear when or how guidelines for lung cancer screening could be drawn up, and until they are, insurers including government programs such as Medicare are unlikely to pay the average $300 cost of a scan.\n\nFor the study, the middle-aged and elderly smokers were scanned with either a spiral CT or a chest X-ray once a year for three years starting in August 2002. They were followed for five years.\n\nThe researchers waited until an independent panel could document a 20 percent reduction in cancer deaths, or could determine that there was no significant benefit.\n\nAs of last month, 354 people who got CTs had died of lung cancer, compared to 442 who got ordinary X-rays. This worked out to a 20.3 percent lower risk of dying for the spiral CT group, and researchers stopped the study.\n\nCaught early, lung cancer can be cured surgically, but it causes vague symptoms and usually is not diagnosed until it has spread. Only 15 percent of lung cancer patients live 5 years or more.\n\n\u201cNo one should come away from this announcement believing that it is safe to continue to smoke,\u201d National Cancer Institute director Dr. Harold Varmus told a news conference.\n\n\u201cThis screening does not prevent lung cancer and it does not protect the large majority of subjects from death by lung cancer,\u201d Varmus said.\n\nDr. Bruce Johnson of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, who is on the board of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, said he doubted most people would see the findings as a green light to smoke.\n\n\u201cThe majority of lung cancer diagnoses in the United States now are either in people who never smoked or in people who have quit,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nIn 2006, Dr. Claudia Henschke of New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center caused a stir when she published a study saying that 80 percent of lung-cancer deaths could be prevented through widespread use of spiral CT.\n\nHer ideas were controversial to start with and widely disregarded when other researchers found her work had been paid for by a tobacco company.\n\nAlmost all advanced CT scanners can perform a spiral CT, and about 60 percent of U.S. hospitals have such a machine.

That previous finding was \u201cvery good news in the field,\u201d said Dr. Bruce Johnson of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, who treats lung cancer patients and reviewed the results for Reuters Health.\n\nThis latest study, published in the journal Lung Cancer, looked at death rates in a different, smaller population of heavy smokers, and estimated that those who received up to two CT scans would have between a 36 and 64 percent lower risk of dying, compared to those who went unscreened.\n\nThe data are \u201cconsistent\u201d with earlier studies but there are still many issues to resolve regarding lung cancer screening, Johnson said.\n\nFor one, scientists haven\u2019t yet worked out how often to screen people, and when to start. It is not clear when or how guidelines for lung cancer screening could be drawn up, and until they are, insurers including government programs such as Medicare are unlikely to pay the average $300 cost of a scan.\n\nFurthermore, an April study showed that 21 percent of a patient\u2019s initial lung CT scans show suspicious lesions that turn out not to be cancer, but lead to needless invasive follow-up procedures and radiation exposure, as well as stress and anxiety for patients and their families.\n\nThe high so-called \u201cfalse positive\u201d rate is an issue, said Dr. James Hanley of McGill University, who also reviewed the findings for Reuters Health, but many mammograms also find lesions that turn out to be benign. And for lung cancer, doctors know there is a high false-positive rate and have a set protocol to follow in order to determine which lesions are dangerous, added Johnson.\n\nLung cancer kills 1.2 million people a year globally and it will kill 157,000 people in the United States alone this year, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nTobacco use accounts for some 85 percent of lung cancer cases in the U.S., and one estimate puts a smoker\u2019s lifetime absolute risk of developing lung cancer between 12 percent and 17 percent. Five-year survival rates for lung cancer are low.\n\nIn recent years, CT scans, in particular, have been promoted by some hospitals and advocacy groups for lung cancer screening, even though studies had not yet shown definitively whether such screening saves lives.\n\nIn 2006, Dr. Claudia Henschke, currently based at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and Arizona State University, caused a stir when she published a study concluding that 80 percent of lung-cancer deaths could be prevented through widespread use of spiral CT.\n\nHer ideas were controversial to start with, especially when other researchers found her work had been paid for by a tobacco company.\n\nIn the current study, funded in part by manufacturers of CT scanners (along with government and other sources), Henschke and her colleagues compared outcomes for nearly 8,000 smokers and former smokers who volunteered to undergo CT scans to outcomes in two sets of people with smoking histories who were not scanned.\n\nThe three groups of people had some important differences, such as in average age and how long and heavily they had smoked, so the researchers had to use mathematical tools to try to eliminate the influence of those differences, said Hanley. For instance, to compare death rates, the researchers tracked how many people died among those who were screened, then pulled out all the people with similar underlying characteristics in the other two groups and looked at their death rates, Hanley explained.\n\nA total of 64 people died in the screened population, the authors report \u2014 but applying the death rate among people with the same underlying characteristics in one of the unscreened populations, they estimated that the number of deaths would have been 100. This translates into a 36 percent lower risk of dying among the screened population.\n\nApplying the same methods to the other unscreened population, the authors estimated that screening was associated with a 64 percent lower risk of dying.\n\nOverall, research is suggesting that CT scans of people at risk of lung cancer might make a dent in cancer mortality, and it\u2019s possible that more frequent screening might make an even bigger dent, Hanley noted. \u201cIf screening is going to work, you\u2019ve got to keep at it.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "\n\n\n\nThis story generally meets the specific requirements of this criterion, but the overall tone and structure of the report lead readers toward an exaggerated sense of the benefits reported in this study. \nPutting aside fundamental questions about study design addressed earlier, there should have been more attention to the absolute differences in the actual versus expected outcomes for the smokers included in this study. The story highlights mortality reductions of 36 to 64 percent. While it does report deep into the story that 64 smokers died of lung cancer out of almost 8,000 in the main study group, readers would have to pull out their calculators to learn that based on these numbers\u2026 a 36 percent relative reduction in lung cancer mortality translates into an absolute reduction of less than half a percent. Specifically, 0.8 percent (64 out of 7995) of the smokers screened with CT died of lung cancer, while based on one comparison the researchers say the expected lung cancer death rate would be 1.2 percent (99.8 out of 7995). That is a difference of 0.4 percent. The story should have noted that based on these statistics, more than 200 smokers would have to be screened in order to make a difference for one of them.\nThe story also errs by highlighting that another report (based on an actual comparison of screening to not-screening) reported a 20 percent reduction in lung cancer deaths, without also noting that those researchers reported about 300 smokers would have to be screened in order to stave off one lung cancer death.\nThe story should have also clearly told readers that even if screening reduced lung cancer deaths by 20 percent in the most rigorous trial to date, that does not mean that screening would prevent 30,000 lung cancer deaths a year (20 percent of the 157,000 lung cancer deaths per year reported in the story).", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Broccoli has been linked to a growing list of health benefits, such as a reduced risk of cancer and osteoporosis.

For older adults trying to slim down, pumping iron might be the way to go.\n\nA new study by researchers at Wake Forest University suggests combining weight training with a low-calorie diet preserves much needed lean muscle mass that can be lost through aerobic workouts.\n\nThe findings, \"Effect of Exercise Type During Intentional Weight Loss on Body Composition in Older Adults with Obesity,\" appear in the November issue of the journal Obesity.\n\n\"A lot of older adults will walk as their exercise of choice,\" said Kristen Beavers, assistant professor of health and exercise science at Wake Forest and lead author of the study. \"But this research shows that if you're worried about losing muscle, weight training can be the better option.\"\n\nIn this 18-month study of 249 adults in their 60s who were overweight or obese, restricting calories plus resistance training in the form of weight-machine workouts resulted in less muscle loss, but significant fat loss, when compared to weight loss plus walking or weight loss alone.\n\nLosing weight is generally recommended for those with obesity, but preserving muscle - while losing fat - is particularly important for older adults in order to maximize functional benefit, Beavers said.\n\n\"Surprisingly, we found that cardio workouts may actually cause older adults with obesity to lose more lean mass than dieting alone.\"\n\nLoss of lean mass could have important consequences given the high risk of physical disability among the growing population of older adults.\n\n+ Total fat loss was much greater when participants combined diet plus walking (about 16 pounds) and diet plus weight training (about 17 pounds). Diet alone resulted in about 10 pounds of fat lost over 18 months.\n\n+ Muscle mass loss was greatest with diet plus walking (about 4 pounds) compared with diet alone or diet plus weight training (each about 2 pounds). Put another way, the percentage of weight loss coming from muscle mass was 20% in the weight loss plus walking group, 16% in the weight loss alone group, and 10% in the weight loss plus weight training group.\n\n+ Loss of fat was associated with faster walking speed, while loss of muscle was associated with reduced knee strength.\n\nThese results may be even more important for older adults who gain and lose weight with frequency, because seniors typically don't regain muscle - they regain fat mass - which is \"all the more reason for older adults to try and preserve muscle mass during weight loss,\" Beavers said.\n\nThis is the latest study from the Cooperative Lifestyle Intervention Program (CLIP-II), a single-blind, randomized controlled trial.

The researchers then found a comparison group of women without the disease, who matched the first group in age, ethnicity and clinics where they received treatment.\n\nEarlier studies have found that women taking bisphosphonates have a lower risk of breast cancer. But it was unclear if that effect could be chalked up to the drugs, because the condition they are meant to treat \u2014 bone thinning, or osteoporosis \u2014 is tied to low estrogen levels, which also cuts breast cancer risk.\n\nColon cancer, on the other hand, has not been linked to estrogen, said Dr. Gad Rennert of the Carmel Medical Center in Haifa, whose findings are published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\nHis team found that women who had been taking bisphosphonates \u2014 mainly the drug alendronate (Fosamax), which costs around $10 per month in the U.S. \u2014 for at least a year had a considerably lower risk of developing colon cancer later on.\n\nEven after considering other factors tied to the disease \u2014 like aspirin or statin use and eating lots of vegetables \u2014 their risk was 59 percent lower than that of women who hadn\u2019t taken the drugs.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, one in 19 men develops colorectal cancer at some point, and slightly fewer women do.

It\u2019s roughly the 50th coronary artery bypass Liao has performed using the robotic system at the University of Minnesota Medical Center, Fairview, and the surgeon said he\u2019s seen enough cases to believe it\u2019s making a difference.\n\n\u201cThe difference is, the length of stay is cut in half,\u201d he said.\n\nThe da Vinci is criticized by health policy experts as the poster child for the medical arms race \u2014 the competitive fever among hospitals to buy new technology whether or not it improves care. The robotic systems come with million-dollar price tags and are used for a limited number of surgeries \u2014 mostly the removal of cancerous prostates in men or uteruses in women.\n\nStudies have disagreed on whether the outcomes of these surgeries are better when using the robotic system versus other minimally invasive techniques.\n\nThose limitations haven\u2019t deterred hospital executives, though, who see the robotic systems as crucial for attracting and retaining surgeons and patients. The number of da Vinci robots has doubled in Minnesota in less than two years, with two at the university and four at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester.\n\nSurgeons believe the growth in robotic heart procedures will help justify those investments and may ultimately reduce costs if they shorten patient stays. There\u2019s a competitive interest for heart surgeons as well. With more patients using stents to prop open clogged arteries, surgeons are seeing their own number of procedures decline.\n\nWhen California-based Intuitive Surgical first unveiled the da Vinci eight years ago, it was marketed as a heart surgery device.

Raikar mostly uses the surgical robot to repair or replace damaged mitral valves, which separate the two chambers on the left side of the heart.\n\nThe robotic system puts a surgeon at the controls of a large viewing console. The doctor peers inside at magnified three-dimensional images coming from cameras inside the patient. Hand-held controls allow the surgeon to maneuver tools that are threaded into the patient through small incisions.\n\nRaikar said the magnified vision allows him to do more valve repairs, which present lower risks of complications than replacements. Unlike other surgeries, there are no minimally invasive alternatives for valve repairs, he said. The only other option is open-heart surgery, which carries a higher risk of infections and longer recoveries.\n\nLiao said the robotic surgery was the right choice for Holmes, the bypass patient.\n\nHolmes was a competitive decathlete with no hint of heart problems until he collapsed earlier this year at the University of Minnesota Field House and his heart stopped beating. Workers there used an external defibrillator to restart his heart, and doctors cooled him into hypothermia to reduce damage to the brain caused by the disruption of blood flow.\n\nLater, Holmes learned a key artery to his heart was completely clogged. Liao feared that cutting open Holmes\u2019 chest and sternum for an open bypass surgery would disrupt his rehabilitation from the cardiac arrest and delay his plans to return to athletics.\n\nUsing the da Vinci, Liao disconnected the mammary artery \u2014 which usually directs blood to the left breast \u2014 and connected it to the heart so normal blood flow could resume. A stabilizer held a section of the beating heart in place so he could secure the new coronary artery.\n\nIf all goes as expected, Holmes could go home today.\n\nJeremy Olson can be reached at 651-228-5583.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The report does not summarize findings of benefits and harms.

To complicate matters, many migraine sufferers can also experience severe bouts of nausea and vomiting.\n\nAnother expert described the problem this way.\n\n\"I've had some patients where the nausea and vomiting was so bad they couldn't even swallow a pill,\" said Nancy Waltman, a nurse practitioner with the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Nursing, Lincoln Division.\n\nA nasal spray is available, as is an injection, but many patients aren't comfortable with these options, Khan and Waltman noted.\n\nKhan said the Zecuity patch is \"simple, efficient and can deliver the exact amount of dosage with minimal variability.\"\n\nThe patch is attached to the upper arm or thigh, and when the patient pushes a button the drug is delivered through the skin. Zecuity, which is battery-operated, delivers 6.5 milligrams of sumatriptan over the course of about five hours and can relieve nausea, as well as reduce sensitivity to light and sound.\n\nNuPathe Inc., which makes Zecuity, hopes to have the patch on the market later this year.\n\nResearch involving 800 patients ultimately led to the approval of Zecuity. One study found that 18 percent of patients using the patch were headache-free after two hours, compared with 9 percent of those using an inactive placebo. About half achieved a reduction in their headache after two hours, compared with 29 percent of those using the placebo.\n\nAnd 84 percent of patients using the patch were relieved of their nausea, compared with 63 percent of those in the placebo group, according to a company news release.\n\nThe most frequent side effects were pain at the site of application along with tingling, itching, warmth and discomfort.\n\nPatients with heart disease or who are using antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors should also be careful when taking sumatriptans, said Waltman, who added that she thought the patches \"are wonderful.\"\n\nOne concern, though, is cost, Waltman cautioned.\n\nIt's not clear how much the patches will cost, but the class of medications known as triptans can be expensive, as much as $300 a month (although sumatriptan now has a generic version), Waltman said.\n\nIn general, though, \"the more options that are available to migraine headache patients, the better,\" Waltman said. \"Migraine patients tend to be underdiagnosed and undertreated and inappropriately treated.\"\n\nNuPathe CEO Armando Anido told Bloomberg News, \"We anticipate the product will be available for sale in the fourth quarter of this year.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Library of Medicine has more about migraines.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story provides active and placebo group response rates for patients in the Zecuity studies, which we\u2019ll call good enough for a satisfactory.

But in some individuals too many platelets are produced \u2013 a condition known as thrombocytosis, thought to affect about half a million people in the UK over the age of 40.\n\nResearchers say that raised platelet counts are as good a predictor of getting any cancer as a lump in the breast is for breast cancer.\n\n\u201cThis is a clue which can be used in practice by GPs to help them select patients for further investigation \u2026 most excitingly in some patients who may not already have other symptoms of cancer to achieve earlier diagnosis,\u201d said Sarah Bailey, co-author of the research from the University of Exeter.\n\nPrevious studies have suggested a link between thrombocytosis and various cancers, with recent guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence advising high platelet counts could be a sign of cancer of the oesophageal, stomach, lung or uterus.\n\nBut it remained unclear whether the condition could signal an increased risk of all cancers, and how it ties in with factors such as age and sex.\n\nWriting in the British Journal of General Practice, Bailey and colleagues report how they examined data from almost 50,000 individuals aged 40 or over who had been given a blood test by their GP. The patients were selected at random from a national database.\n\nIn total, over 31,000 patients found to have a raised platelet count, and nearly 8,000 without, were included in the analysis.\n\nWithin a year of the blood test, the team found that cancer was more common among those who had thrombocytosis: 11.6% of men and 6.2% of women were found to have cancer compared to 4.1% of men and 2.2% of women without a raised platelet count. In the general population about 1% of individuals over the age of 40 develop cancer each year.\n\nFor comparison, among women aged between 50 and 59 who have discovered a breast lump, the proportion who are found to have breast cancer is 8.5%.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe found cancer was more commonly diagnosed in men with raised platelet counts than it was in women with raised platelet counts and we believe that is because there are more causes of raised platelet counts in women that are not cancer,\u201d said Bailey.\n\nThe team add that cancer was more common among for those who had thrombocytosis for longer. Of the men who had a raised platelet count of the same value or higher six months after being diagnosed with thrombocytosis, 18.1% developed cancer, while for women the figure was 10.1%.\n\nWhile many different types of cancer were present in both groups, the team found that breast and prostate cancers were less common among those with thrombocytosis than in the general population, while lung and colorectal cancers were more common.\n\nFor about a third of cases of lung and colorectal cancer in patients with thrombocytosis, there had been no other symptoms that raised the suggestion of cancer. That, say the researchers, makes testing for raised platelet count a valuable tool, and could speed up cancer diagnosis by at least three months for thousands of patients a year.\n\nRichard Neal, professor of primary care oncology at the University of Leeds who was not involved in the research, welcomed the study.\n\n\u201cThis is an excellent study that demonstrates the potential for a commonly used blood test to identify some patients with cancer earlier,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis work should begin to change practice, so that GPs should be testing patients with raised platelet counts for cancer, especially those without other potential cancer symptoms,\u201d he added.\n\nDr Jasmine Just, Cancer Research UK\u2019s health information officer, said more research was need to confirm whether further tests following a high platelet count would save lives.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of possible reasons a person\u2019s platelet count might be high, and in most cases it won\u2019t be down to cancer,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cMeasuring platelet count in patients who don\u2019t otherwise warrant a blood test is not necessarily a good idea. But if a patient has a blood test for another reason and a high platelet count is found, then one of the possible diagnoses doctors should consider is cancer.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story\u2019s author did a good job of describing the numbers of patients whose data were\u00a0drawn from a national database, and the percentages across ages and genders who were identified with some form of cancer within a year of a high platelet count, compared to percentages of who were not diagnosed with cancer. It also noted the rate of cancer diagnosis in the general population overall as a comparative factor. There were also data given about the types of cancer most diagnosed and the potential impact for early diagnosis. The thoughtful reader will come away with the notion that even if platelet counts are utilized widely, they are not going to serve as markers for\u00a0most cancers that arise in adults.\nOne thing the story needed on this note was\u00a0better framing on how these results differed by age.

Brenner, a professor of radiation oncology at Columbia University who co-authored the most recent of a series of reports in the past year warning about the potential risks of CT scans. \"On an individual basis there's probably not a big risk, but a small cancer risk applied to an increasingly large population spells trouble down the road. That's the concern.\"\n\nAlthough some prominent medical groups have issued warnings against overusing the exams -- especially for children -- some experts worry about frightening patients away from the invaluable tests.\n\n\"You don't want people to avoid getting a potentially lifesaving diagnosis or therapy because they are afraid to get a CT scan,\" said Arl Van Moore Jr., a Charlotte radiologist who chairs the American College of Radiology's board of chancellors. \"When a scan is done the right way for the right reasons, the benefits clearly outweigh the risks of doing it.\"\n\nCT (computed tomography), sometimes called CAT (computed axial tomography), is performed by computerized machines that scan patients with X-rays to create three-dimensional cross-sectional images of organs and other parts of the body, providing far greater detail than standard single X-rays.\n\nThe number of scans performed each year in the United States has increased sharply, rising from about 3 million in 1980 to at least 67 million in 2006. There are many reasons for the increase, including improvements in the technology that have speeded the procedure, a growing list of uses and a proliferation of the machines.\n\n\"CT has become ubiquitous,\" said Jason Launders, a senior project officer at the ECRI Institute, an independent nonprofit health-care research organization outside Philadelphia that released a report last year warning about the potential risks. \"Now if you go into an emergency room you can be scanned in a few minutes. You can't get that kind of information any other way. So physicians tend to use CT as sort of a first line in working out a diagnosis.\"\n\nThe use of CT scans is expected to continue to rise as possible new applications, such as for lung and colon cancer screening, become more widespread.\n\nWhile the value of CT scans for screening remains the focus of debate, no one questions the value of the tests for allowing doctors to quickly diagnose a wide variety of health problems, including head injuries, heart problems, cancer, appendicitis, fractures and gallstones.\n\n\"CT is probably the biggest advance in diagnostic radiology that has ever occurred,\" said Thomas Ohlhaber, deputy director of the Division of Mammography Quality and Radiation Programs at the Food and Drug Administration. \"Exploratory surgery that was common 10 or 15 years ago has virtually disappeared and all the risks associated with that have gone away because of CT. But nothing comes free of risks.\"\n\nThe concern comes from the fact that CT scans expose patients to much more radiation than standard X-rays. A CT chest scan, for example, exposes a patient to more than 150 times more radiation than a standard chest X-ray. That's more than twice as much as a typical person receives from the environment in an entire year. (See graphic.)\n\nThe upsurge in CT use has fueled a big jump in the annual amount of radiation that each American is receiving from medical procedures of all kinds. The average level of that exposure has increased about 600-fold since 1980, according to a federal report being published this year.\n\n\"At the moment, about half of medical radiation exposure is from CT scans,\" said Fred A. Mettler Jr., a radiation health expert at the University of New Mexico who helped prepare the report. CT scans represented just a few percent of the average American's exposure to radiation from medical tests in 1980, he noted.\n\nBecause it would take decades to follow a large number of patients who have undergone CT scans to determine the exact risks posed by the exams, there are no direct data demonstrating the danger. But researchers have estimated the risk based on what is considered the best information available about the health effects of radiation -- data collected from survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as exposure of nuclear plant and medical workers.\n\nUsing that information, experts have estimated that every 1,000 to 2,000 CT scans may produce one fatal cancer that would not have occurred otherwise.\n\nAlthough that overall risk is relatively small, the large number of scans being performed could translate into a significant number of cancers. Brenner and his colleagues estimate that CT scans may be responsible for perhaps 2 percent of all cancers in the United States. The ECRI Institute estimated the scans may be causing 6,000 extra cancers each year, half of them fatal.\n\n\"Twenty years from now we could see a huge bonus of cancer coming through because of indiscriminate use of CT today,\" Launders said. \"That's the real issue people are worried about.\"\n\nThe individual risk varies depending on the age of the patient and the type of scan. Younger people face more risk than older people because they have more time for a cancer to develop. Children are especially vulnerable because their rapidly developing bodies are at least four times as sensitive to the damaging effects of radiation. A child's risk may run as high as one case of cancer for every 500 scans, experts say.\n\nAmong adults, \"young women have the highest risk,\" said Andrew Einstein of Columbia University, who evaluated the risks from cardiac CT scans in a paper published in July in the Journal of the American Medical Association. A 20-year-old woman faced the greatest risk -- one additional cancer for every 143 scans, he reported.\n\nSome question the estimates, saying the risk of exposure from radiation from multiple CT scans may not be the same as from radiation from an atomic bomb.\n\n\"It's very difficult, in our opinion to equate the data from Hiroshima, where you had an instantaneous entire-body dose of radiation, compared to a cumulative dose for multiple CT scans,\" said Moore, the radiologist. \"It's apples and oranges. It's not really the same.\"\n\nEinstein, Mettler and others, however, disagree. \"Radiation is radiation. Those are X-rays that the folks at Hiroshima and Nagasaki got. These are X-rays from a CT scan. They're really the same thing,\" said Brenner, whose report was published in November in the New England Journal of Medicine. \"If the dose is the same, then the risk is going to be the same.\"\n\nAlthough the companies that make the CT machines have been developing new protocols designed to minimize radiation exposure, particularly for children, everyone agrees that the most prudent thing to do is to eliminate unnecessary use.\n\nWhile there are scant hard data about how often CT scans are done needlessly, several experts estimated that perhaps one-third could be eliminated. There are many reasons CTs may be overused. Some CTs are full-body \"virtual physicals\" performed on people who appear perfectly healthy -- a practice widely opposed by medical authorities.\n\nSome say part of the blame lies with physicians who have financial interests in imaging facilities. \"There is statistical evidence that indicates that more scans are ordered when a physician has a financial interest than when he doesn't,\" said Moore.\n\nDefensive medicine also plays a role, with some doctors ordering the tests to stave off accusations that they withheld the most cutting-edge technology from their patients.\n\nIn other cases, overuse results from worried patients and from parents demanding CT scans that may not be needed. Other times doctors may not realize how many tests involving radiation patients have already undergone -- information that could influence a doctor's decision -- or may order a CT scan when other tests that do not involve radiation, such as a blood test, an MRI or an ultrasound, would suffice. \"There are alternatives that are arguably just as good,\" Brenner said.\n\nAnd patients also can take more responsibility for reducing the number of unnecessary scans.\n\n\"If a patient walks in and says, 'Tell me what the dose is from this and tell me what the risk is,' they are going to make the doctor start thinking about it,\" Mettler said.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story may subtly oversell the benefits of treatment.\u00a0 It is not clear that the source articles provide good information about the number of surgeries avoided, difficult diagnoses made, or lives saved due to CT scanning.\u00a0 The story inaccurately states that \"no-one questions the value of the tests for allowing doctors to quickly diagnose\u2026problems.\"\u00a0 There are many problems, even those listed, that can be diagnosed with modalities other than CT that are\u00a0less invasive, costly or harmful.

Getting enough calcium early in life can reduce the risk of fracture and the bone-weakening condition osteoporosis later on.\n\nCalcium supplements and vitamin D are regularly prescribed for bone health in post-menopausal women, who are at higher risk of osteoporosis as their estrogen levels decline.\n\nResearchers raised new questions earlier this year about the effectiveness of calcium supplements when a study found only modest results in increasing bone mass for older women who took the supplements.\n\nNow, says Senay, a study in the Archives of Internal Medicine shows calcium supplements do reduce the risk of fractures in elderly women, but only among those who take them regularly.\n\nResearchers studied the effect of 600-milligram calcium supplements twice a day on women over 70 and found that only those women who took 80 percent or more of their pills were less likely to experience fractures. These women showed about a 10 percent chance of fracture, compared with 15 percent.\n\nMore than half of the women took their pills as directed, but women who didn't take them regularly had the same risk of fracture as those who took a dummy pill.\n\nThe message here, Senay says, is that calcium supplements are useful for bone health \u2014 but you should only take them if you do so regularly, as directed by a doctor.\n\nThe study earlier this year also found that women who took supplements regularly reduced their chance of fracture more than those who didn't.\n\nCalcium recommendations vary according to age.

The maximum recommended intake of calcium is 2,500 milligrams.\n\nRemember, Senay urged: Most people can achieve the recommended calcium intake by eating three or four servings of dairy products and other foods that contain calcium per day.

Stein said.\n\nAdditional results for PCSK9 inhibitor drugs are expected to be presented at the annual American College of Cardiology meeting which begins Saturday in Chicago, he said.\n\nThe REGN727 study included three trial arms. Two arms used 72 healthy volunteers who were either injected with a single dose of the drug in increasing amounts to test for side effects, which is the purpose of a phase one clinical trial. A third arm included 21 people with a family history of high cholesterol, and 30 people with nonfamilial high cholesterol. All of those subjects were also receiving treatment with the statin Lipitor.\n\nA control group of subjects with nonfamilial high cholesterol was treated only with a special diet. None of the subjects who received REGN727 discontinued the study because of adverse effects, and the subjects who received REGN727 had a striking reduction of 60 to 65% in LDL cholesterol, according to Stein.\n\nStein characterized the results of the trial as \u201cpretty dramatic.\u201d\n\nA PCSK9 inhibitor, Stein said, differs from statins \"because it's unlike any other drug.

This study is the first to examine similar positive effects from college courses taken by older adults, said Lenehan, of the University of Tasmania.\n\nThe study participants, who were screened to exclude people who had dementia, completed a baseline series of tests to measure cognitive capacity, or an individual's ability to use brain networks efficiently in areas such as memory, information processing, decision making and planning. The participants in the college studies group took a wide range of courses, including history, psychology, philosophy and fine art. Most of the students took courses on campus, but some completed online classes. The researchers suspect that campus study may provide greater benefits in boosting cognitive capacity because of social interaction with professors and fellow students, but the study didn't analyze any differences between on-campus or online courses.\n\nThe participants completed the same cognitive tests each year during the four-year study, with 92 percent of the college-studies group displaying a significant increase in cognitive capacity, while the remaining 8 percent generally maintained their cognitive capacity. For the control group, 56 percent displayed a significant increase in cognitive capacity, while 44 percent had no change. The participants' age, gender, feelings of well-being or level of social connectedness didn't affect the findings. The research was published online in the journal Neuropsychology.\n\nPrior research has shown that college study earlier in life may increase cognitive capacity, and it appears the same may be true for older adults, Lenehan said.\n\n\"It is possible that any mentally stimulating activity later in life may also enhance cognitive capacity, such as other adult-education classes or programs to increase social interaction,\" she said.\n\nThe control group was significantly older than the college studies group, but there were no significant differences in baseline cognitive capacity scores, the study noted. The researchers also didn't find any correlation between age and cognitive capacity scores at any point during the study. Some participants in the control group may have been doing crossword puzzles or other mentally stimulating activities that boosted their cognitive capacity, Lenehan said.\n\nThe participants who took college classes volunteered for the study so they probably had a greater interest in continuing education that the general senior population, the journal article noted. The study was too short to reveal any long-term effects so the researchers plan to follow the participants as they age to provide additional evidence of whether college studies may reduce the risk or delay the onset of dementia.\n\nArticle: \"Sending Your Grandparents to University Increases Cognitive Reserve: The Tasmanian Healthy Brain Project;\" Megan E.

The present study was aimed to investigate whether such changes can be reversed by daily melatonin ingestion.\n\nThe older we get, the more likely our circadian rhythms are disrupted. For example, blood pressure (BP), not only tends to increase but as well become more irregular. Luckily, as we show in our research, melatonin helps to ameliorate both trends.\n\n63 senior respondents of a mean age of 80 were studied during 3 consecutive weeks. First week control data were collected for 7 successive days. Over the next 2 weeks, the seniors were administered a low dose of melatonin (1.5 mg) each day by night at 10:30 p.m. On the third week data were monitored again.\n\nMelatonin significantly reduced BP. The hypotensive effect was dependent on time. The maximum systolic BP lowering effect of melatonin falls between 3:00 and 8:00 in the morning, the time of the highest risk of heart attacks and strokes. Nighttime and morning BP decreased more profoundly on average -8/3.5 mm Hg for SBP/DBP, respectively.\n\nMoreover, the higher the mean systolic BP was during the first week, the more it dropped on the second week of melatonin administration. Melatonin also decreased the overall variability in BP.\n\nMelatonin ws effective in synchronizing disrupted circadian rhythms of BP, heart rate and body temperature, making these circadian rhythms smoother and less irregular. None of these effects was found in 34 placebo treated seniors, thus ruling out the possibility that rhythms could be improved just because of regular schedule and presence of medical personal who took measurements.\n\nIn conclusion, melatonin can be of great value for aged people suffering from hypertension as an adjuvant substance complementing basic medication as it is able to stabilize circadian BP, heart rate profiles and their phase relationships.

Patients with large-vessel occlusions can then be routed to a Comprehensive Stroke Center with endovascular capabilities. In contrast, a standard physical examination achieved only 40 to 89 percent accuracy in identifying patients with large-vessel occlusion who could benefit from endovascular therapy.\n\nThe volumetric impedance phase shift spectroscopy (VIPS) device (Cerebrotech VisorTM, Cerebrotech Medical Systems, Pleasanton, CA) works by sending low-energy radio waves through the brain that change frequency when passing through fluids. Such waves are reflected back through the brain and then detected by the device. When a patient is having a severe stroke, the brain's fluids will change, producing an asymmetry in the radio waves detected by the VIPS device. The greater the asymmetry, the more severe the stroke.\n\nEndovascular therapy within 24 hours is the standard of care for emergent large-vessel occlusion, but the chance of achieving a good outcome decreases by approximately 20 percent for each hour that passes before treatment.\n\nThe researchers hope that the device will save valuable time -- especially important in stroke where time is brain -- when it is deployed with emergency medical personnel in the field. This is because the accuracy of the device simplifies the decision made by emergency personnel about where to take patients first, according to Raymond D. Turner, M.D., professor of neurosurgery and chief of the Neuroscience Integrated Center of Clinical Excellence at MUSC. Turner served as principal investigator for MUSC in the VIPS for the Non-Invasive Detection of Hemispheric Bioimpedance Asymmetry in Severe Brain Pathology (VITAL) study reported in the article.\n\n\"Transfer between hospitals takes a lot of time,\" said Turner. \"If we can give the information to emergency personnel out in the field that this is a large-vessel occlusion, that should change their thought process in triage as to which hospital they go to.\"\n\nIn the study, the VIPS device was deployed with emergency medical personnel in regions served by five Comprehensive Stroke Centers equipped with the endovascular capabilities to treat large-vessel occlusions that underlie severe stroke. Their goal was to use the device to accurately identify severe stroke and then compare the results to established physical examination methods practiced by emergency personnel such as the Prehospital Acute Stroke Severity Scale.\n\nBoth healthy participants and patients with suspected stroke were evaluated by emergency personnel using the VIPS device. Three readings were taken and averaged -- a process that takes about 30 seconds. Patients were also later evaluated by neurologists who provided definitive diagnoses using neuroimaging.\n\nCompared to the neurologists' diagnoses, the device displayed 92 percent specificity -- the ability to detect the difference between patients with severe stroke and those with other conditions such as mild stroke or healthy participants with no brain pathology. This places the VIPS device above standard physical examination tools used by emergency personnel that display specificity scores between 40 and 89 percent.\n\nThe VIPS device is made by Cerebrotech Medical Systems, which paid consultants to analyze the neuroimaging data independently. The neuroimaging data was needed to teach the VIPS device which radio waves were indicative of stroke. Yet the consultants did not have access to the VIPS radio wave data during their review of the images, thereby eliminating the potential of the consultants to choose data that might artificially inflate the device's accuracy. It is also not clear how the device would work for patients with cranial implants, as metal interferes with the device's operating radio frequencies.\n\nThe device's success may be found in its ability to give emergency personnel a clear answer as to whether a patient is experiencing a severe stroke. The VIPS device requires very little training to operate compared to that required to learn standard emergency examination skills, thereby reducing the possibility of human error during emergency diagnosis.\n\nIn their next steps, the researchers are undertaking the VITAL 2.0 study to determine if the VIPS device can use complex machine learning algorithms to teach itself how to discriminate between minor and severe stroke without the help of neurologists. If so, the VIPS device could have widespread clinical implications, helping emergency personnel decide whether to take a patient to a comprehensive stroke center or a primary stroke center for treatment.\n\nTurner likens the use of the VIPS device in detecting severe stroke to the use of electrocardiography (ECG) to definitively detect acute myocardial infarction. He predicts that the device has the potential to be used widely by emergency personnel but also to appear in other public spaces. \"This could potentially be something like a defibrillator,\" said Turner. \"You can find out if a patient is having a stroke, just like you can put a defibrillator on a patient to see if they're having a heart attack.\"\n\nThis study was funded by Cerebrotech Medical Systems.\n\nAbout MUSC Founded in 1824 in Charleston, The Medical University of South Carolina is the oldest medical school in the South.

They say it will enable the body to produce more of a natural compound that supports a healthy metabolism.\n\nMany products in the supplement business are launched with questionable science, but Elysium said studies in mice show a clear connection between increased levels of this compound, called NAD, and improved health in older mice.\n\n\u201cThere have been a lot of new findings in the past five years identifying some extremely promising compounds that promote wellness and health. [We want to] make them available for people to improve their health before they get sick,\u201d said Guarente, an Elysium Health founder and its chief scientific officer. \u201cWe are filling a space by combining natural compounds with scientific validation.\u201d\n\nThe active ingredients in Basis are nicotinamide riboside, a substance that makes NAD and is found in traces in many foods such as milk, and pterostilbene, an antioxidant found in blueberries. Both substances are available individually as dietary supplements.\n\nAt a recommended dose of two gel caps daily, a month\u2019s supply of Basis will cost $60 ($50 with a membership) and will be available online only.

Most of them have no scientific basis, and you don\u2019t know what you are getting.\u201d\n\nGuarente was involved in several other efforts to develop antiaging medicines that did not pan out. He was a founder of Elixir Pharmaceuticals and then became involved with Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, which conducted research into the potential antiaging properties of a chemical found in red wine.\n\nWith Elysium, Guarente and his colleagues are entering an industry with a mixed reputation. At $25 billion annually and growing, vitamins and supplements are hugely popular among consumers. But the business has often been criticized by mainstream medicine for making ambitious claims about quick cures and miraculous health improvements that are not subjected to rigorous scientific scrutiny.\n\nIf Elysium Health were developing Basis as a drug, it would have to conduct clinical trials with humans to prove that it works, and the Food and Drug Administration would have to sign off on its scientific evidence before it could be sold as medicine.\n\nBut as a supplement, Basis and similar products only have to be shown to be safe for humans to take, with labels that are not misleading.

It had already spread to her lungs, and the prognosis was grim. She had about a 50-50 chance of surviving the next six months.\n\n\"Yeah, that was the turning point of life, right there,\" she says.\n\nWhat Belvin didn't know at the time was that a revolutionary treatment for melanoma had begun testing in clinical trials. An immunologist named Jim Allison, now at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, had figured out that if the immune system was tweaked just right, it could do a better job of killing the cancer than the usual treatments. (Joe Palca worked for Allison early in both men's careers.)\n\nAllison's treatment was still experimental, but if it worked, it had the potential to save Belvin's life.\n\n\"It's a new modality for treating cancer,\" Dr. Samuel Broder, a former director of the National Cancer Institute, says now of Allison's pioneering research. \"It used to be there were three basic treatment options for cancer \u2014 surgery, radiation and chemotherapy \u2014 or some combination of those three. It's fair to say there's now a fourth option.\"\n\nAllison's long search for this new kind of treatment \u2014 one that has since become a lifesaver for some cancer patients \u2014 began around a decade before Belvin got sick, when Allison was running a lab at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nAt the time, he was what you could call a research scientist's research scientist. He was fascinated by certain powerful cells of the immune system \u2014 T cells. A subset of white blood cells, T cells travel around the body and can \"protect us against just about anything,\" Allison says.\n\nT cells do recognize cancer cells, but not in a way that can eliminate the disease. Allison had been studying T cells for years, and thought that by tinkering with one key molecule on the outside of these cells, he could enhance their response to cancer, enough to eradicate the illness.\n\nHe and one of his grad students ran an experiment to test the tweaked T cells on cancerous tumors in mice, and the initial results astounded them. The T cells seemed to be doing just what Allison had hoped they would do \u2014 shrink the tumors and kill the cancer.\n\nAllison repeated the experiment with more mice over his winter break. After a few tense days, the tumors again disappeared.\n\n\"These mice were cured,\" Allison says.\n\n\"I've been doing this sort of stuff for years, and I'd never seen anything like that,\" Allison says. \"And I thought, 'If we could do that in people, this is going to be amazing.' \"\n\nAllison tried to persuade drugmakers to create a human version of the treatment that had worked in mice. He thought they would jump at the chance to try a new approach.\n\nBut the biotech companies he met with didn't bite. In those days, most firms were focused on drugs that would target tumors directly, and Allison was asking them to try something very different.\n\n\"This was targeting the immune system, not the cancer,\" he says. \"We weren't trying to kill the cancer cells. We were letting the T cells kill the cancer cells.\"\n\nThanks, but no thanks, the companies told him.\n\n\"I got very depressed,\" Allison says. He was sure this was the most important work of his career, but he had to get others on board.\n\nEventually, a scientist attending one of Allison's research talks was intrigued enough to contact a pal at the biotech firm Medarex. The company had recently developed technology that could make a human version of Allison's therapy, and was willing to give it a try.\n\nIt took a decade, but eventually Allison's big idea was ready for testing in people. A clinical trial to study the drug \u2014 now called ipilimumab, or Ippy for short \u2014 was set up at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.\n\nAllison decided he wanted to be part of this next chapter in the testing of immunotherapy, so he packed up his California lab and moved it to Sloan Kettering.\n\nAs it happens, Belvin was also in New York \u2014 a patient of Dr. Jedd Wolchok at Sloan Kettering. By the fall of 2004, Belvin had run through all the treatment options available to her. Nothing had worked to control the melanoma; it continued to spread dangerously throughout her body.\n\nBelvin remembers feeling sick and depressed, and says she wasn't even paying much attention when Wolchok walked into the exam room and suggested one last treatment.\n\n\"Sharon, we have an opportunity to participate in a clinical trial here. It's something you should consider,\" Wolchok told her.\n\nBelvin says she signed up without hesitation. After just four injections of Ippy across three months, her cancer was nearly gone. And at Belvin's follow-up appointment a year later, Wolchok delivered news that was hard for her to take in: \"Sharon, you no longer have cancer.\"\n\nAnd in the next breath, Belvin recalls, \"he goes, 'Oh, the guy who invented this is upstairs. Do you want to meet him?' \"\n\n\"Yes, of course I want to meet him!\" she told her doctor.\n\nWolchok called Allison, who was working nearby, and told him to drop everything and come to the clinic \u2014 a part of the hospital Allison had rarely seen. Though the research scientist couldn't imagine why Wolchok was in such a rush, he quickly figured it out as he opened the door and was greeted by Belvin with a huge hug.\n\nBelvin says she tried not to tackle him. \"It was hard to control myself,\" she says. \"I owe this man my life.\"\n\nBelvin was the first recipient of the immunotherapy that Allison had ever met. \"It really meant a lot,\" he says. \"It reminded me what it's all about at the end of the day.\"\n\nThat was in 2005; today, Sharon Belvin is still cancer-free.\n\nIppy is now sold under the brand name Yervoy by Bristol-Myers Squibb, which bought Medarex in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, Jim Allison has become a bit of a celebrity in the cancer research world. Among other honors, he was a 2015 recipient of the prestigious Lasker Award for his achievements in medical science.\n\nHe's become well-known among patients, too. Now and again, Allison fields calls from patients yearning to learn from the master himself what it will take to cure their disease.\n\nAllison can't really answer them. Each case is different, and using a patient's own cells to destroy tumors won't work in every patient or in every type of cancer. Still, the approach offers promise to some people that other therapies can't, and has transformed the way doctors think about cancer treatment.\n\nIt might be too early to say we're going to cure cancer, Allison says, \"but we're going to cure certain types of cancers.

Drugs such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors cut off the supply of oestrogen, reducing the chances that the cancer will return after surgery. But about 12,000 of the 40,000 diagnosed oestrogen-receptor positive (ER-positive) cancers still recur every year.\n\nEarly research \u2013 most of it still in the lab \u2013 published in the journal Breast Cancer Research has shown that some early breast cancer tumours can produce a molecule made from cholesterol called 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC). It can mimic oestrogen and encourage tumours to grow.\n\nDr Lesley-Ann Martin at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, where the research has been carried out, said: \u201cDuring the course of treatment, ER-positive breast cancers, that are \u2018fed\u2019 by oestrogen, often become resistant to standard hormone therapy. Our research has demonstrated that these cancer cells can use a cholesterol molecule to mimic oestrogen so that they continue to grow without it.\n\n\u201cThis is hugely significant. Testing the patient\u2019s tumour for 25-HC or the enzymes that make it may allow us to predict which patients are likely to develop resistance hormone therapy, and tailor their treatment accordingly. Our study also demonstrates that statins could be a valuable addition to breast cancer treatment, and that this warrants investigation in clinical trials.\u201d\n\nThe research has not yet been tested in humans. The scientists grew cancer cells in the lab in the absence of oestrogen and found they produced an alternative fuel, in the form of the cholesterol molecule. They then interfered with production of the molecule and found it slowed the cancer cells\u2019 growth by between 30% and 50%.\n\nThe scientists say the findings are boosted by two studies which found the over-activation of certain genes linked to cholesterol production were linked with a poorer response to the anti-cancer drugs.\n\nCholesterol production by the tumour will not be the only reason why ER-positive breast cancers recur, but campaigners are excited by the possibilities for a treatment if further research corroborates these findings.\n\nDelyth Morgan, chief executive at Breast Cancer Now, which funded the research, said: \u201cThis is a really crucial discovery.

But this is early research and greater clinical evidence is now needed to understand the potential risks and benefits of this approach.\u201d\n\nAnother charity, Breast Cancer Care, said the research was promising but needed further trials. \u201cThis early study raises an interesting question of whether cholesterol-reducing treatment, such as statins, could help lower the chances of breast cancer returning for some women who have developed a resistance to hormone therapy,\u201d said Jane Murphy, clinical nurse specialist.\n\n\u201cWe know that many women can be consumed with fear of their breast cancer coming back, which can have a huge impact on their ability to move forward after treatment.

And the feeling was horrible,\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt would take my heart away when I was trying to eat and I\u2019d look up and they were looking at me.\u201d\n\nSamuels, 72, has essential tremor, a movement disorder characterized by uncontrollable shaking mostly in the hands or legs. An estimated 10 million people in the United States suffer from the condition, according to the International Essential Tremor Foundation. The disorder isn\u2019t fatal, but it tends to get worse with age and to affect patients\u2019 quality of life.\n\nDoctors usually treat essential tremor with medication, but the drugs don\u2019t work well for all patients. Now a new trial finds that a treatment to kill off neurons in a certain region of the brain can do away with tremors in some patients who don\u2019t respond to drugs. But the procedure brings lasting side effects in some patients, and its long-term usefulness is still being studied.\n\nIn an ongoing clinical trial at 11 medical centers globally, researchers are using ultrasound waves to treat the source of essential tremor in the brain. The therapy, called focused ultrasound thalamotomy, uses the energy generated by sound waves to burn off certain cells in the thalamus, a region of the brain where the essential tremor is thought to originate.\n\nPatients are placed in an MRI machine with their head secured in place in a special helmet. They are awake as doctors aim over 1,000 low-energy ultrasound waves to create a lesion \u2014 an injury to the tissue \u2014 inside the thalamus.\n\n\u201cAs we make the test lesion, we see a subtle improvement in their tremor and the patients notice it,\u201d said Dr. Rees Cosgrove who is leading the trial at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston.

It has been developed by InSightec, which is funding the trial along with the Focused Ultrasound Foundation and the Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation.\n\nA pilot study on MRI-guided focused ultrasound treatment was published in 2013.\n\nThe randomized trial provides further data on the treatment. In the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday, 76 patients were treated with focused ultrasound, and their tremor was evaluated after the first, third, sixth, and 12th month. Researchers found that the severity of essential tremor reduced significantly over that time in the patients who underwent the treatment versus those who had a sham procedure. The treated group also evaluated their quality of life as much better than before the procedure, despite a few persistent side effects like gait disturbance and paresthesia \u2014 the sensation of prickling pins and needles.\n\nNeurologist Dr. Bryan Ho, who is not involved in the trial, noted that tremor suppression remained sustained throughout the 12 months. But he expressed concern about the side effects of the treatment.\n\n\u201cOver a third of patients actually experienced either gait disturbance or paresthesia. It\u2019s a pretty high incidence of side effects,\u201d said Dr. Ho, who is the director of the Movement Disorders Program at Tufts Medical Center.\n\nHe added that since these patients were only followed for a year, there isn\u2019t enough data available yet to determine the long-term efficacy of the treatment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one and done,\u201d he said. \u201cPatients may have some benefit for a period of time, but how do they do five years from now or 10 years from now after the treatment?

The doctors at Brigham will follow up with Samuels \u2014 and others who undergo the treatment \u2014 for up to five years and run more MRI scans and neurological exams to find out for how long the lesion lasts and keeps the tremor suppressed.\n\nFor now, the treatment has had an immense impact on patients\u2019 lives. \u201cThese people are able to go back and now use that hand like you and I use our hands, without thinking about it,\u201d said Dr. Cosgrove.\n\n\u201cThey can write their names again, they can feed themselves, they are not embarrassed about being in public.

Two to three times a week was not enough, the researchers found in an earlier study.\n\n\"Based on a series of studies performed by our team over the past 5 years, this 'dose' of exercise has become my prescription for life,\" said senior author Dr. Benjamin Levine, Director of the Institute and Professor of Internal Medicine at UT Southwestern. \"I think people should be able to do this as part of their personal hygiene - just like brushing your teeth and taking a shower.\"\n\nThe regimen included exercising four to five times a week, generally in 30-minute sessions, plus warmup and cool-down:\n\u2022 One of the weekly sessions included a high-intensity 30-minute workout, such as aerobic interval sessions in which heart rate tops 95 percent of peak rate for 4 minutes, with 3 minutes of recovery, repeated four times (a so-called \"4 x 4\").\n\u2022 Each interval session was followed by a recovery session performed at relatively low intensity.\n\u2022 One day's session lasted an hour and was of moderate intensity. (As a \"prescription for life,\" Levine said this longer session could be a fun activity such as tennis, aerobic dancing, walking, or biking.)\n\u2022 One or two other sessions were performed each week at a moderate intensity, meaning the participant would break a sweat, be a little short of breath, but still be able to carry on a conversation -- the \"talk test.\" In the study, exercise sessions were individually prescribed based on exercise tests and heart rate monitoring.\n\u2022 One or two weekly strength training sessions using weights or exercise machines were included on a separate day, or after an endurance session.\n\nStudy participants built up to those levels, beginning with three, 30-minute, moderate exercise sessions for the first 3 months and peaked at 10 months when two high-intensity aerobic intervals were added.\n\nThe more than 50 participants in the study were divided into two groups, one of which received two years of supervised exercise training and the other group, a control group, which participated in yoga and balance training.\n\nAt the end of the two-year study, those who had exercised showed an 18 percent improvement in their maximum oxygen intake during exercise and a more than 25 percent improvement in compliance, or elasticity, of the left ventricular muscle of the heart, Dr. Levine noted. He compared the change in the heart to a stretchy, new rubber band versus one that has gotten stiff sitting in a drawer.\n\nSedentary aging can lead to a stiffening of the muscle in the heart's left ventricle, the chamber that pumps oxygen-rich blood back out to the body, he explained.\n\n\"When the muscle stiffens, you get high pressure and the heart chamber doesn't fill as well with blood. In its most severe form, blood can back up into the lungs. That's when heart failure develops,\" said Dr. Levine, who holds the S. Finley Ewing Chair for Wellness at Texas Health Dallas and the Harry S. Moss Heart Chair for Cardiovascular Research. He also holds the Distinguished Professorship in Exercise Sciences at UT Southwestern, which is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year.\n\nEarlier research by UT Southwestern cardiologists showed that left ventricular stiffening often shows up in middle age in people who don't exercise and aren't fit, leaving them with small, stiff chambers that can't pump blood as well.\n\nHowever, the researchers also found that the heart chamber in competitive masters-level athletes remains large and elastic, and that even four to five days of committed exercise over decades is enough for noncompetitive athletes to reap most of this benefit.\n\nIn the current study, researchers wanted to know if exercise can restore the heart's elasticity in previously sedentary individuals - especially if begun in late middle age. Previous studies from Dr. Levine's research program have shown substantial improvements in cardiac compliance in young individuals after a year of training, but surprisingly little change if the training was started after age 65.\n\nTo start the study, researchers recruited 53 participants, ages 45 to 64. Many came from the Dallas Heart Study, which includes 6,000 Dallas residents and is the only single-center heart study of its size and multiethnic composition.

It\u2019s not clear if this change does in fact represent a \u201creversal.\u201d\nIn addition, \u201cdamage from heart aging\u201d is a confusing phrase. Poor oxygen uptake and a loss of heart elasticity are as much a consequence of sedentary lifestyle as they are a result of an aging heart. This is why a headline implying that exercise actually reverses aging in the heart is misleading.\nFinally, the first paragraph of the release claims that exercise can help prevent the risk of future heart failure, even though the study itself makes it clear this outcome is speculative. At the very least, the release should have cautioned that a much larger and longer study would be needed to document any impact on heart failure outcomes.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "For men with advanced prostate cancer, the news for decades has been mostly bleak.

These findings suggest the pills may help protect against death in patients with pneumonia.\n\nStatins such as Lipitor, Crestor, and a generic called simvastatin are widely prescribed to lower so-called \u201cbad\u201d or LDL cholesterol \u2014 a risk factor for heart disease \u2014 and are credited with being among the most successful drugs in helping to prevent heart attacks and strokes.\n\nSeparate research published in March found that lowering cholesterol levels could help the body\u2019s immune system fight infections, a finding that appears to be supported by Tuesday\u2019s study.\n\n\u201cStatins are safe, cheap, and an easy intervention in terms of delivery,\u201d said Ian Douglas, a lecturer in epidemiology at the LSHTM who led the research.\n\n\u201cGiven the potential low number needed to treat to prevent a death suggested by this study, we believe that a strong case exists for randomized trials of statins in people with serious infection to determine if a simple and practical intervention at the point of diagnosis of pneumonia has a beneficial effect.\u201d\n\nDouglas\u2019s team, whose research was published in the British Medical Journal, used data from computerized medical records of doctors\u2019 practices in Britain to identify statin users.\n\nThey then matched each statin user \u2014 who was aged over 40 when first prescribed a statin between 1995 and 2006 \u2014 with up to five non-statin users for comparison.\n\nPatients with a record of pneumonia were followed for six months to see if they died, and the researchers found that 13 percent (109 out of 847) of statin users died compared with 20 percent (578 out of 2,927) of non-statin users.\n\nDouglas noted that since this study looked at patients who were already taking statins when they developed pneumonia, a full randomized clinical trial was needed to find out whether starting a statin at the time of diagnosis has a similar effect.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "To its credit, the story presents the benefits in appropriate statistical terms when it says, \u201c13 percent (109 out of 847) of statin users died compared with 20 percent (578 out of 2,927) of non-statin users.\u201d This is better than saying statin users had a 35% lower risk of dying from pneumonia, which is how many stories would have put it. Nevertheless, many readers will probably come away from this story with an exaggerated sense of the benefits, as the story never provided the absolute death rate due to pneumonia among all statin users compared with non-statin users. Since pneumonia is not very common,\u00a0any benefit according to this measure would have been much smaller than the 7%\u00a0reduction mentioned in the story.

The research was an early-stage study, conducted to test the side effects and best dosage of a potential new combined therapy, and the findings were published today in the journal Cancer Discovery.\n\nPembrolizumab, which is marketed under the brand name Keytruda, works by blocking a protein called PD-1, which interferes with immune system function. Blocking PD-1 with pembrolizumab enables the immune system cells to better attack the cancer. While pembrolizumab has been a significant advancement for treating people with a variety of advanced or metastatic cancers, a majority of metastatic melanoma tumors are still resistant to the drug.\n\n\"We have found that the reason patients with metastatic melanoma do not initially respond to immunotherapy with an anti-PD-1 is that their immune system was not ready,\" said Dr. Antoni Ribas, the study's lead author, a professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and director of the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center Tumor Immunology Program. \"So we thought, 'What if we change that by injecting the therapy drug into the metastatic lesions and change the microenvironment of the cancer?'\n\n\"It's like having a pile of wood but not having a match to light it. With this new approach, SD-101 is the match that starts the fire.\"\n\nThe researchers found that SD-101 not only directs T cells to cancer cells, but it also makes the microenvironment more hospitable for the T cells, so that they can better kill the cancer cells.\n\nAll 22 people in the study had an advanced stage of inoperable or metastatic melanoma. Nine were receiving an immunotherapy treatment for the first time as part of the study. Seven of those nine had a positive response to the drug combination, including two for whom the tumors disappeared completely.\n\nThe other 13 people in the study had previously received a type of immunotherapy before the study. Of them, two had a partial response, meaning parts of the tumors shrank, but the tumors did not go away completely. Five more showed some reduction in the tumors, but the other participants did respond to the therapy.\n\nThe results of the study suggest that the combination of pembrolizumab and SD-101 could provide an alternative treatment for people with melanoma whose tumors have not responded or would be unlikely to respond to other therapies.\n\n\"For all patients with advanced cancer, immunotherapy using PD-1 inhibitors has really changed the face of cancer treatment. Unfortunately, this therapy still only works in a subset of patients,\" said Dr. Deborah Wong, assistant clinical professor of medicine at the Geffen School of Medicine and an oncologist at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, who was also an author of the paper.\n\n\"This particular combination has been especially gratifying because not only does the SD-101 therapy drug induce tumor shrinkage at the actual site where it's injected, but it's working in conjunction with pembrolizumab to shrink tumors outside of the ones we're directly injecting.\"\n\nThe study highlights the need for more research into combination therapies like this one, because many people with cancer do not respond to immunotherapy or experience a reoccurrence of their tumors after treatment.\n\n\"We are really starting to understand the science of how immunotherapies work in patients,\" said Ribas, who is also the director of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy Center at UCLA. \"By understanding that, we can find more ways to make that therapy more active.

The test correctly excluded all the 31 controls and diagnosed both Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies with 93 percent accuracy.\n\nImportantly, test results were available within two days, compared to related assays that require up to 13 days.

Scientists from the University of California San Diego, University of Verona in Italy, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, and the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, collaborated on the project. The research findings were published in Acta Neuropathologica Communications.\n\nMultiple neurological disorders, including Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, involve the abnormal clumping of a protein called alpha-synuclein into brain deposits called Lewy bodies. The pathological processes in these diseases resembles prion diseases in mammal brains. Like prion diseases, Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies result in progressive deterioration of brain functions and, ultimately, death. Parkinson\u2019s disease is about 1,000 times more common than prion diseases, affecting up to 1 million people in the United States, with 60,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Lewy body dementia affects an estimated 1.4 million people in the United States, according to the Lewy Body Dementia Association.\n\nEarly and accurate diagnoses of these brain disorders is essential for developing treatments and identifying patients eligible for clinical trials. The diseases typically progress for years before symptoms appear, and once they do, distinguishing one disease from another can be difficult.\n\nThe NIAID group continues to adapt the RT-QuIC assay to detect additional types of neurological diseases with greater accuracy using the least invasive patient sample possible \u2014 whether that is blood, skin, nasal brushings, or other samples.

As an outpatient treatment, GAE does not require open surgery or physical therapy, and takes 45-90 minutes to perform.\n\nThis prospective, multicenter clinical trial evaluated 13 patients with severe osteoarthritis pain. Each patient's pain and disability were measured along two scales, with evaluations before and after the treatment. The treatment was successfully completed in all 13 patients, with no adverse events. One month later, researchers followed the progress of eight patients and found that GAE significantly decreased pain (-58 mm on the Visual Analog Scale), reduced stiffness and increased physical function (-36.3 on the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index). Together the scales represent an 80 percent improvement in function compared with pre-procedure conditions.\n\n\"This procedure could have a significant impact in the treatment of osteoarthritis pain as a whole,\" said Bagla. \"The current mainstay of treatment in patients who have arthritis are pain medications, which come with significant side effects and risks. But GAE provides another option for patients struggling with pain and may even allow patients to avoid the painful recovery of knee surgery and the need for the kind of opioid pain medications associated with the dangerous epidemic in the United States.\"\n\nThis study builds on the growing international research around GAE and osteoarthritis. While preliminary data shows that the treatment does work and is feasible, it has only been used in a clinical trial setting.

Up to 7 percent of deaths have been attributed to sitting alone.\n\n\u201cSitting is bad for our health, but it is a big part of daily life for many people,\u201d said Horswill, an expert in exercise and metabolism in UIC\u2019s College of Applied Health Sciences. \u201cExercise is a good way to counteract the negative effects of sitting, but just incorporating physical activity into one part of our day may not be enough to overcome the damage caused by prolonged sitting and an otherwise sedentary lifestyle.\u201d\n\nBecause the workday is a major contributor to sedentary behavior, with more than 20 percent of workers in the U.S. reporting more than 8 hours each day, tactics that promote workstation activity have emerged in recent years, including standing desks, as well as dynamic pedal and treadmill workstations.\n\nHorswill and his colleagues compared the metabolic rate produced by three workstations: seated at a desk, seated at a desk equipped with a device that stimulates leg movement and standing at a desk. The device, which is commercially available, was a movable footrest, suspended from the underside of the desk, which enabled the feet to swing, twist or teeter.\n\nParticipants in the study familiarized themselves with the workstations during one visit. On a second visit, researchers collected metabolic rate and heart rate data during three progressive stages: seated, seated with the device and standing. Each stage was 15 minutes.\n\nThe researchers found that modest movement while seated elevated the metabolic rate more than sitting and more than standing, by 17 and 7 percent respectively, and had no detrimental effect on cognitive function. The findings are published in WORK, a journal affiliated with the Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists and endorsed by the International Ergonomics Association.\n\n\u201cThese results suggest that non-exercise active thermogenesis, which we call NEAT, can increase movement and calorie burning, and may have the potential to impact health,\u201d said Horswill, the senior author on the study. \u201cWe expected to see the metabolic rate increase with each progressive stage, but instead found that metabolic rates from movement while seated were either equal to or higher than rates while standing.\u201d\n\nHorswill says the study needs to be further validated, but that the findings should be especially applicable to individuals poised to benefit from NEAT but unable to access popular standing desks because of injury, disability or discomfort.\n\n\u201cThis is more evidence that NEAT, something everyone can do throughout the day, may be an important strategy for improving health, and even reducing early death,\u201d said Horswill.\n\nHaley Scott and Danel Voorhees are co-authors on the paper.

The retired psychiatrist runs Quackwatch, a Web site on medical scams, and says studies of acupuncture often involve strict research conditions that don't mirror how the procedure is used in the real world.\n\nThe new analysis combined results from studies of patients with common types of chronic pain -- recurring headaches, arthritis or back, neck and shoulder. The studies had randomly assigned patients to acupuncture and either fake acupuncture or standard pain treatment including medication or physical therapy.\n\nThe authors explained their statistical findings by using a pain scale of 0 to 100: The patients' average baseline pain measured 60; it dropped to 30 on average in those who got acupuncture, 35 in those who got fake acupuncture, and 43 in the usual treatment group.\n\nWhile the difference in results for real versus fake acupuncture was small, it suggests acupuncture could have more than a psychological effect, said lead author Andrew Vickers, a cancer researcher at Memorial Sloan-Kettering. The center offers acupuncture and other alternative therapies for cancer patients with hard-to-treat pain.\n\nThe analysis was more rigorous than most research based on pooling previous studies' results, because the authors obtained original data from each study. That makes the conclusion more robust, said Dr. Andrew Avins, author of an Archives commentary and a physician and researcher with the University of California at San Francisco and Kaiser-Permanente.\n\nAcupuncture is relatively safe and uncertainty over how it works shouldn't stop doctors from offering it as an option for patients struggling with pain, Avins said.\n\n\"Perhaps a more productive strategy at this point would be to provide whatever benefits we can for our patients, while we continue to explore more carefully all mechanisms of healing,\" he wrote.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The benefits are clearly explained by the story: \u201cThe patients\u2019 average baseline pain measured 60; it dropped to 30 on average in those who got acupuncture, 35 in those who got fake acupuncture, and 43 in the usual treatment group.\u201d It would have been helpful to include some comparison here.\u00a0 For example, how well do NSAID\u2019s work for these conditions?", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Despite the availability of effective therapies, glaucoma remains a leading cause of blindness. Nearly 3 million people in the United States have the condition. It is often marked by elevated internal eye pressure, called intraocular pressure. Medicated eye drops taken daily or twice daily can lower internal eye pressure to help prevent damage to the optic nerve. But studies show that many patients do not take glaucoma eye drops as directed due to factors such as forgetfulness or physical limitations like arthritis. 1 Some studies show that half of patients stop taking their prescription glaucoma eye drops after a year, leaving them vulnerable to vision loss. 2\n\nResearchers are tackling this challenge of medication adherence with new drug delivery methods. One technology involves a thin silicone ring suffused with medication that slowly releases over time. An ophthalmologist fits the patient with the ring. No surgery is required. The ring is designed to be replaced by an ophthalmologist every six months. This eliminates the need for glaucoma patients to regularly put in medicated eye drops themselves.\n\nOphthalmologists at 10 sites nationwide tested the ring in a phase 2 clinical trial on patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. In the study, 64 patients received the topical ocular insert containing the glaucoma drug bimatoprost. They were also supplied artificial tears. The control group of 66 patients wore an insert treated with no drug but twice a day used 0.5 percent timolol drops, the regulatory benchmark for glaucoma drugs. Eye pressure in the bimatoprost group fell 3.2 to 6.4 mmHg over six months, in comparison to 4.2 to 6.4 mmHG for the timolol group. Overall, eye pressure decreased in the group wearing the bimatoprost ring by about 20 percent from the initial measurements over six months.\n\nAuthors said the device was well-tolerated and safe, with a high retention rate of 89 percent for both groups at six months. The ring became dislodged in 15 patients but was replaced each time, allowing therapy to continue. Some patients experienced itchiness and eye redness, which is not unusual for patients taking glaucoma medication.\n\n\"In making effective treatments easier for patients, the hope is that we can reduce vision loss from glaucoma, and possibly other diseases,\" said study author James D. Brandt, M.D., director of the UC Davis Medical Center Glaucoma Service. \"What is exciting is that this is just one of several sustained-release drug delivery methods designed to help patients who have trouble taking daily eye drops.\"\n\nA phase 3 study of a larger group of patients is expected to begin later in 2016. The authors noted the device could also be used for non-glaucoma medications, with potential applications for dry eye, allergies and inflammation. In addition, the non-invasive nature of the device and its relatively large surface area make this technology a potential candidate for delivering multiple ocular drugs at once, further reducing the burden of self-administration on patients.\n\n\"Six-month IOP Reduction with a Topical Bimatoprost Ocular Insert: Results of a Phase 2 Randomized Controlled Study,\" Brandt, et al.

Herniation occurs where the jelly-like material in the center of the disk bulges through a tear in the disk's tough exterior layer and puts pressure on the roots of the nerves. Herniated disks are often the source of sciatica, or pain that radiates downward from the lower back into the leg.\n\nConservative treatment options for herniated disks range from over-the-counter pain medications to injections of corticosteroids directly into the affected area of the spine. Those who don't respond may require surgery. In some cases, the entire disk must be removed and the vertebra fused together for stability.\n\nAn alternative technique, CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency (pRF), applies energy through an electrode under CT guidance to the portion of the nerve responsible for sending pain signals.\n\n\"Pulsed radiofrequency creates a nerve modulation, significantly reducing inflammation and its associated symptoms,\" said study senior author Alessandro Napoli, M.D., Ph.D., professor of interventional radiology at Sapienza University of Rome in Italy.\n\nDr. Napoli and colleagues studied the approach in patients with back pain from lumbar disk herniation that had not responded to prolonged conservative treatment. In 128 patients, the pRF treatment was delivered directly under CT guidance to the root of the nerve. The treatment was applied for 10 minutes.\n\nFor comparison, a group of 120 patients received one to three sessions of CT-guided steroid injection on the same anatomical target with no pRF.\n\nThe one-year outcomes demonstrated that CT-guided pRF was superior to the injection-only strategy. Patients who received pRF saw greater overall improvement in pain and disability scores during the first year. Relief of leg pain was faster in patients assigned to pRF, and they also reported a faster rate of perceived recovery. The probability of perceived recovery after one year of follow-up was 95 percent in the pRF group, compared with 61 percent in the injection only group.\n\n\"Given our study results, we offer pulsed radiofrequency to patients with herniated disk and sciatic nerve compression whose symptoms do not benefit from conservative therapy,\" Dr. Napoli said.\n\nThe results of the study are superior to those typically reported for usual care strategies and injections and may help a substantial number of patients with sciatic disk compression to avoid surgery, Dr. Napoli added.\n\nThe use of pRF also could improve outcomes for patients set to receive corticosteroid injections.\n\n\"We learned that when pulsed radiofrequency is followed by steroid injection, the result is longer lasting and more efficacious than injection only,\" Dr. Napoli said. \"The effect of pulsed radiofrequency is fast and without adverse events.\"\n\nToday, therapy for spine disorders allows for definitive treatment of symptoms and conditions using different techniques and technologies.\n\n\"Of the different therapies available, pulsed radiofrequency is among the least invasive,\" Dr. Napoli said. \"Treatment lasts 10 minutes, and one session was enough in a large number of treated patients.\"\n\nNote: Copies of RSNA 2018 news releases and electronic images will be available online at RSNA.org/press18 beginning Monday, Nov. 26.\n\nRSNA is an association of over 54,000 radiologists, radiation oncologists, medical physicists and related scientists, promoting excellence in patient care and health care delivery through education, research and technologic innovation.

The unusual fractures that may be associated with certain osteoporosis drugs called bisphosphonates occur lower on the bone. Ironically, that's where the femur, the longest bone in the body, is usually strongest.\n\nThese unusual fractures can occur suddenly without any trauma, such as a fall. And they can be complex breaks that are difficult to fix and slow to heal.\n\nIn the study, published in current issue of JAMA, researchers looked at 716 of these fractures in more than 200,000 Ontario women who had taken bisphosphonates.\n\nWomen who had taken the drugs for five years or longer had nearly a three times higher risk of suffering atypical fractures compared with women who had only transient exposure to such drugs.\n\nThat's called the relative risk, and it seems alarming. But the \"absolute risk\" of these unusual fractures is still pretty low \u2014 13 fractures per year for every 10,000 people taking bisphosphonates for five years or longer. That is, long-term users have a risk of about a tenth of 1 percent.\n\nMoreover, the study verified that long-term use of bisphosphonate drugs reduces the risk of typical osteoporosis fractures by 24 percent. That's obviously a lot more benefit than risk.\n\n\"The big message really is the number of typical hip fractures is much, much larger than the number of unusual thigh fractures,\" says Dr. Gillian Hawker of St. Michael's Hospital in Ontario, an osteoporosis specialist and study author. \"So although we believe there is an increased risk of these unusual fractures, it doesn't outweigh the benefit\" of taking osteoporosis drugs.\n\nMerck, which makes Fosamax, the original and leading bisphosphonate drug, criticizes the new study. The company said in a statement to Shots that women who had atypical fractures were different from those who didn't. For instance, they started out with a history of more fractures, so the comparison isn't valid.\n\n\"Merck believes that the results must be interpreted with caution and should not be overstated,\" says the company's statement.\n\nStill, the accumulating evidence that there is a risk of these serious, unusual fractures associated with bisphosphonates is getting a lot of attention in the medical community.\n\nLast fall the Food and Drug Administration issued a \"safety update\" urging doctors and patients to be on the lookout for the problem. Often, the FDA says, an atypical fracture is preceded by pain in the thigh, apparently from a small stress fracture that signals bone weakness. \"Although it is not clear if bisphosphonates are the cause, these unusual femur fractures have been predominantly reported in patients taking bisphosphonates,\" the FDA says.\n\nThe concern is heightened by another, even rarer possible side effect \u2013 osteonecrosis of the jaw. Basically, it means that part of the jawbone dies.\n\nSome reports \u2013 including one published earlier this month in the Journal of Dental Research \u2014 have found a higher risk of the jaw problem in dental patients taking bisphosphonates.\n\nAgain, Merck disputes the connection. Earlier this month it convinced a New Jersey jury that Fosamax did not cause one woman's jaw problems.\n\nAmid all the debate, many specialists are wondering if women on bisphosphonates should take a \"holiday\" from the drug from time to time. The idea is that perhaps they'd get the osteoporosis benefit without the risks of osteonecrosis and unusual fractures. \"You could do five years on, five years off,\" Dr. Clifford Rosen, a bone specialist at Maine Medical Center, tells Shots. \"Some people are doing three on and three off.\"\n\nBut at some point, should these patients start taking the drug again? \"I don't think anybody knows,\" Rosen says. \"The thought is you would have to put them back on at some time.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story did a good job explaining the tradeoffs of benefits and harms and quotes a doctor who worries that fear of rare events may be preventing women from taking drugs that could save them from the typical hip fractures.\nIf only the article took the extra step by talking about treatment benefits in absolute terms, rather than relative.

A secondary subgroup analysis of patients with hypopharyngeal and laryngeal carcinoma was undertaken. Rates of laryngeal preservation and laryngectomy-free survival were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Quality of life was evaluated using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core questionnaire and head and neck module.\n\nResults Of the 424 patients included in the trial, 168 treated patients with cancer of the larynx or hypopharynx were included in this analysis (90 in the CRT group and 78 in the radiotherapy alone group). The median (range) age of the patients was 59 (40-80) years in the CRT group and 61 (35-81) years in the radiotherapy alone group. In the CRT group, 72 patients (80.0%) were male and 18 (20.0%) were female. In the radiotherapy alone group, 62 (79.5%) were male and 16 (20.5%) were female. The rates of laryngeal preservation at 2 years were 87.9% for CRT vs 85.7% for radiotherapy alone, with an HR of 0.57 (95% CI, 0.23-1.42; P = .22). Similarly, the HR for laryngectomy-free survival comparing CRT vs radiotherapy alone was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.54-1.11; P = .17). This study was not powered to assess organ preservation. Median overall survival was 27 (95% CI, 20-45) vs 21 (95% CI, 17-35) months for the CRT and radiotherapy alone groups, respectively, with an HR of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.60-1.27). No differences between treatments were reported regarding overall quality of life, need for a feeding tube, or speech.\n\nConclusions and Relevance The results of a possible cetuximab-related laryngeal preservation benefit for patients with hypopharyngeal or laryngeal cancer are intriguing; these results need to be interpreted in the context of a retrospective subset analysis with limited sample size.\n\nHistorically, locoregionally advanced squamous cell cancers of the larynx or hypopharynx have been treated with surgical resection, usually involving laryngectomy with or without postoperative radiotherapy.1 Although laryngectomy is an effective treatment, investigators have sought therapeutic strategies that result in voice preservation. Various modifications of surgical techniques have been explored.2-5 Alternatively, in the early 1980s, investigators evaluated curative primary radiotherapy with salvage surgery as an option for these patients.6,7 Retrospective studies8,9 that compared primary radiotherapy with salvage surgery to initial surgery with postoperative radiotherapy found similar rates of survival in patients with advanced laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancers.\n\nAfter the realization that many patients could avoid total laryngectomy with the use of primary radiotherapy, several combination chemoradiotherapy strategies were introduced for patients with laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancers. In large phase 3 randomized clinical trials, induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy demonstrated equivalent overall survival compared with surgical resection and postoperative radiotherapy in patients with laryngeal10,11 and hypopharyngeal cancers.12 More recently, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 91-11 trial revealed that radiotherapy with concomitant cisplatin resulted in a superior laryngeal preservation rate compared with induction with cisplatin and fluorouracil followed by radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone for these advanced laryngeal cancers.13,14 However, this treatment did not produce a survival benefit.\n\nThe appropriate use of surgery or radiotherapy-based approaches for organ preservation has been the subject of much debate.15-18 Unfortunately, there has been a lack of improvement in overall survival for patients with laryngeal carcinoma in large database studies19-21 examining the last 30 years of care. Investigators have reported that poor follow-up may contribute to the potential for larger and less curable recurrences, and surgeons experienced with radiotherapy with salvage surgery need to be involved as early as possible.20,21\n\nThe analysis described in this report was performed to assess the laryngeal preservation rates of patients with locoregionally advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers who were entered into a randomized clinical trial of cetuximab and radiotherapy (CRT) compared with radiotherapy alone.22,23 This group of patients represents a subgroup (168 patients) of a larger population (424 patients) that also included patients with oropharyngeal cancers. It is noteworthy that this randomized clinical trial was not designed to enroll a sufficient number of patients to definitively and prospectively address the subject of the analysis reported herein. Previous reports22,23 of the overall randomized clinical trial found locoregional control and survival advantages associated with the addition of cetuximab to radiotherapy.\n\nPatients were enrolled in the multicenter, open-label, stratified, randomized, phase 3 study from April 1, 1999, through March 31, 2002, from 73 centers in the United States and 14 other countries. Patients who entered the trial had stage III or IV nonmetastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx (Figure 1 and Table 1). Patients were eligible if they had pathologically confirmed stage III or IV squamous cell carcinoma, had measurable disease, had no distant metastases, had no prior therapy for the tumor under study, and were medically suitable to undergo definitive radiotherapy. This subgroup includes the patients with hypopharyngeal and laryngeal cancers. The protocol was approved by the ethics review boards at the participating institutions, and all the patients provided written informed consent.\n\nPatients were initially evaluated with a comprehensive head and neck examination, which included panendoscopy. The primary tumors and lymph nodes were staged by the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging classification of 1998. Initial evaluation included computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck region and chest radiography. Patients began treatment within 2 weeks after this initial evaluation, as determined by the randomization procedure.22 Patients who underwent no surgery or less extensive operations were censored at death or date of last contact.\n\nThe primary radiotherapy was delivered with curative intent. Investigators selected 1 of 3 radiation fractionation regimens: once daily, twice daily, or concomitant boost regimen (Figure 1). Cervical lymph node drainage regions, considered to be at high risk for subclinical disease, were treated with a dose of 50 to 54 Gy. The primary tumor and gross nodal disease received full-dose radiotherapy (70-76.8 Gy, depending on fractionation). However, if a postoperative neck dissection was planned, gross nodal disease could be treated with 60 Gy.\n\nFor patients randomized to CRT, cetuximab treatment consisted of an initial dose of 400 mg/m2 and was delivered as a 120-minute intravenous infusion. This initial dose was delivered 1 week before the initiation of CRT. Patients received weekly cetuximab infusions during the radiotherapy treatment. Seven weekly infusions were delivered at a dose of 250 mg/m2 for a period of 60 minutes each.\n\nFor patients who were scheduled to have a planned neck dissection, surgery was scheduled to take place 4 to 8 weeks after completion of CRT or radiotherapy alone.\n\nEvaluations, including physical examination, hematologic testing, and chemical profiles, were performed weekly for the duration of the study. A pharmacologic profile was also performed weekly on patients receiving cetuximab infusion (CRT group). Patients provided a history and underwent a physical examination, which included a fiberoptic examination of the tumor, as well as an assessment of all study end points at required time points after the completion of treatment.22 Posttreatment assessments were performed 4 and 8 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. Patients who were scheduled for a planned postoperative neck dissection could have their 8-week assessment at the 6-week time point, along with posttreatment computed tomography. Subsequently, patients were evaluated every 4 months during the first and second years. They were evaluated semiannually during years 3 to 5. These follow-up assessments included imaging studies, consisting of computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck region.\n\nThe instruments used in this study were the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 version 3.0 and the Quality of Life Head and Neck Module 35. The self-administered core questionnaire consisted of 30 questions and incorporated 5 functional scales, 3 symptom scales, and a global health and quality-of-life scale. The remaining single items assessed additional symptoms commonly reported by patients with cancer, as well as the perceived financial effect of disease and treatment. All scales and single items met the standards for reliability. The 35-item module comprised 1 multi-item scale and a series of single items assessing head and neck\u2013associated symptoms and adverse effects from conventional therapy.\n\nThe randomization was not stratified by primary site of cancer; hence, the results presented below are a retrospective analysis of the selected subset of patients. A CONSORT flow diagram was included with the original publication of the trial.23 A trial profile for the analysis presented here is shown in Figure 1. The primary end point of the study was to examine differences in the rate of locoregional disease control maintained for 1 year. The duration of locoregional control was defined as the absence of locoregional disease progression at the scheduled follow-up visits and was determined through a masked review of the investigator-generated data by an independent committee of experts. The duration of locoregional control was from randomization to the first documented progression or recurrence of locoregional disease or death from any cause. Overall survival was calculated from randomization to death from any cause. Tumor present in a neck dissection, which was performed for any reason after 15 weeks after radiotherapy, constituted locoregional progression. Distribution of time-to-event parameters was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and treatment effects were compared using a log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to calculate the nonstratified hazard ratio (HR). The Kaplan-Meier method was also used to estimate the rate of preservation of larynx.24 Patients who underwent no surgery or lesser operations were censored at death or date of last contact.\n\nA total of 424 patients participated in the study and 168 were included in the subanalysis (90 in the CRT group or 78 in the radiotherapy alone group). Most patients from both treatment groups were treated with the concomitant boost fractionation regimen. The 2 treatment groups were well balanced with respect to sex, tumor stage, node stage (Table 1), and the rate of neck surgery (16% in the CRT group and 14% in the radiotherapy alone group).\n\nThe median durations of treatment were 52, 46, and 43 days for once daily, twice daily, or concomitant boost, respectively, for patients treated with CRT and 52, 44, and 43 days, respectively, for patients treated with radiotherapy alone. For patients who received cetuximab, the median number of cetuximab infusions was 8 (range, 1\u201311). The median cumulative cetuximab dose was 2154 mg/m2 (range, 14-2887 mg/m2). The number of patients who received 7 or more cetuximab infusions was 80 (88.9%). The radiotherapy quality assurance review found that the mean and median doses for the once daily, twice daily, and concomitant boost regimens were 68.7 and 70.0 Gy, 74.3 and 74.4 Gy, and 70.8 and 72.0 Gy, respectively; these doses were similar in both treatment groups. Radiotherapy adherence for patients who received CRT or radiotherapy alone was balanced; 65 (72.2%) received CRT and 56 (71.8%) received radiotherapy alone as planned or with minor deviation. A total of 121 patients (72%) were treated as planned or with minor deviation. Major acceptable deviations in the CRT and radiotherapy alone groups were found in 13 (14.4%) and 13 (16.7%) patients, and major unacceptable deviations were observed in 3 (3.3%) and 5 (6.4%) patients, respectively. A total of 9 (10.0%) and 4 (5.1%) patients in these respective groups were not evaluable for a radiation quality assurance review. The differences in radiotherapy adherence between the 2 treatment groups were not statistically significant. Neck dissections were performed in 14 patients (15.6%) treated with CRT and 11 patients (14.1%) treated with radiotherapy alone.\n\nLocoregional control was the primary end point of the phase 3 study. For this subgroup of patients with laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers, locoregional control was slightly improved for patients who received CRT compared with radiotherapy alone (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.56-1.13) (Table 2). The 2-year rates of locoregional control were 36.9% in the CRT group and 25.7% in the radiotherapy alone group. Survival was also slightly improved for patients who received CRT compared with radiotherapy alone (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.60-1.27) (Table 2). The 3-year survival rates were 41.9% in the CRT group and 39.0% in the radiotherapy alone group.\n\nThe rates of laryngeal preservation (no need for salvage laryngectomy) were 87.9% at 2 and 3 years in the CRT group compared with 85.7% at 2 years and 76.8% at 3 years in the radiotherapy alone group. The 2.2% and 11.1% absolute improvements in the rates of laryngeal preservation, at 2 and 3 years, respectively, favored CRT compared with radiotherapy alone (Figure 2). However, this improvement was not statistically significant (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.23-1.42; P = .22). In addition, there was a 4.0% and 8.9% absolute improvement in laryngectomy-free survival at 2 and 3 years, respectively. Again, these differences did not reach statistical significance (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.54-1.11; P = .17) (Figure 2).\n\nThe most frequently reported adverse events are given in Table 3. The frequency of grades 3 and 4 mucositis/stomatitis and odynophagia was not significantly different among patients who received CRT compared with radiotherapy alone. Patients who received CRT had a greater rate of acneiform rash compared with patients who received radiotherapy alone (Table 3). Chills, fever, and headache were the only toxic events reported to occur at any grade with significantly higher frequency (P = .002, P = .01, and P = .004, respectively) in patients in the CRT group than in the radiotherapy alone group; however, their incidences were low (chills, 16 [17.8%] vs 2 [2.6%]; fever, 20 [22.2%] vs 6 [7.7%]; headache, 20 [22.2%] vs 5 [6.4%]).\n\nThe quality-of-life responses were evaluated in a longitudinal design in all patients. Baseline assessment was performed at or just after randomization. Subsequent assessments took place before the beginning of the fourth week of radiotherapy, at the 8-week posttreatment evaluation, and at the 2 every-4-month follow-up evaluations of year 1. Plots of mean changes in global health status, use of a feeding tube, or speech problems reveal no differences between the treatment groups (Figure 3). A positive value in change indicates an improvement for the patient.\n\nDifferences in mean changes in swallowing at radiotherapy week 4 (\u221215 in the CRT group and \u221225 in the radiotherapy alone group, P = .02), loss of appetite at radiotherapy week 4 (\u221211 in the CRT group and \u221218 in the radiotherapy alone group, P = .03), nausea at week 8 after radiotherapy (\u22127.3 in the CRT group and 0.3 in the radiotherapy alone group, P = .04), coughing at radiotherapy week 4 (7.4 in the CRT group and \u22125.6 in the radiotherapy alone group, P = .02) and at week 8 after radiotherapy (\u22123.2 in the CRT group and 1.1 in the radiotherapy alone group, P = .04), constipation at month 8 (2.6 in the CRT group and \u221219 in the radiotherapy alone group, P < .001), and cognitive functioning at month 12 (\u22127.0 in the CRT group and 4.6 in the radiotherapy alone group, P = .04) were not seen at the other time points.\n\nWhen laryngectomy is the primary treatment for locoregionally advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers, patients gradually adjust to the loss of natural phonation, but the condition substantially interferes with normal communication and social interactions.25 In addition, although the effect of the procedure on voice frequently receives the greatest consideration, the presence of the stoma may also adversely affect patients\u2019 quality of life.26\n\nIn the analysis reported herein, laryngeal preservation rates were studied in a subgroup of patients who were part of a large phase 3 trial that compared primary radiotherapy with or without the antiepidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody cetuximab. The use of CRT produced a higher rate of laryngeal preservation compared with radiotherapy alone for patients with locoregionally advanced laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancers. Although the difference in the rates of laryngeal preservation between the 2 groups did not reach statistical significance, the initial trial was not powered to assess this subgroup question. The HR of 0.57 is a strong indicator that cetuximab, when added to radiotherapy, may improve laryngeal preservation. The 87.9% rate of laryngeal preservation at 2 years for CRT found in this trial is similar to the rate reported for the use of radiotherapy and concomitant cisplatin in Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 91-11 trial (n = 547).13\n\nPatients who undergo a laryngectomy often experience a difficult adjustment process. Even when the patient achieves a certain level of comfort with various techniques of artificial speech,27 the ability to communicate with others is hampered.26,28,29 Investigations have explored both the patient\u2019s and the interviewer\u2019s perceptions of the patient\u2019s difficulty with communication after laryngectomy.26 Of interest, the interviewers perceived the patients\u2019 impairment with communication as a much greater infringement on quality of life compared with the patients\u2019 perceptions. Patients who underwent laryngectomy believed that interference with social activities resulted in a greater detrimental effect regarding their quality of life compared with the interviewers\u2019 perception of this factor. Therefore, patients have their own perceptions, as well as the perceptions of others, as potential hurdles to normal activities after laryngectomy.\n\nThe perception of life without a larynx plays an important role in a patient\u2019s treatment decision. In a recent trial from France, 269 patients were queried about the treatment choices they might make if they faced the diagnosis of advanced laryngeal cancer.30 Only 29% stated that they would not consider options with a lower chance of cure if told that the best option, with respect to survival, was total laryngectomy. However, their enthusiasm for seeking laryngeal-preserving options waned when told about potential adverse effects, such as tracheostomy or permanent gastrostomy. An older report31 of interviews with firefighters and executives who were asked to envision that they had advanced laryngeal cancer determined that they were willing to accept a 15% to 30% reduction in life expectancy for a laryngeal-preserving treatment compared with total laryngectomy. These studies30,31 demonstrate the importance of reviewing options and potential adverse effects with patients before making a decision regarding the best treatment.\n\nConsidering the importance of laryngeal function, many head and neck cancer treatments have been directed toward the goal of laryngeal preservation. One of the largest randomized clinical trials was designed to evaluate laryngeal preservation compared with radiotherapy alone, concomitant chemoradiotherapy, and induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy.13,14 Each treatment group included at least 180 patients, thus providing much greater statistical power than the current communication. The use of concomitant cisplatin and radiotherapy resulted in a statistically significant improvement in laryngeal preservation compared with radiotherapy alone, with a hazard ratio of 0.46. However, the induction regimen of cisplatin and fluorouracil did not improve laryngeal preservation over radiotherapy alone. Neither concomitant chemoradiotherapy nor induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy resulted in improved overall survival compared with radiotherapy alone. Furthermore, there were greater severe acute toxic effects from the chemoradiotherapy treatments compared with radiotherapy alone,13 but no significant differences in severe late toxic effects were noted in the comparison of the 3 treatment arms.14 Unfortunately, the concomitant chemoradiotherapy arm had an increase in deaths not attributable to cancer compared with the other 2 arms; this finding needs to be explored further to determine whether undetected fatal late treatment toxic effects are greater with concomitant regimens.\n\nAlthough induction chemotherapy was not used in this trial, it has been the subject of many past and recent assessments involving laryngeal preservation, as well as other efficacy and safety outcomes.10-14 A retrospective review32 of the phase 3 TAX 324 trial (Induction Chemotherapy Comparing Taxotere Cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil With Standard Cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil Followed by Chemoradiation in Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer) in patients with laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancers revealed that induction chemotherapy of docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (n = 90) compared with cisplatin plus fluorouracil (n = 76) followed by chemoradiotherapy with weekly carboplatin resulted in significantly improved overall survival (P = .02) and progression-free survival (P = .03) for the docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil group. Among patients undergoing surgery, laryngectomy-free survival was also significantly greater with docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (P = .03).\n\nThe TREMPLIN (Radiotherapy With Cisplatin Versus Radiotherapy With Cetuximab After Induction Chemotherapy for Larynx Preservation) trial compared the efficacy and safety of induction chemotherapy using docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil, followed by chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin (n = 60) or cetuximab (n = 56), for laryngeal preservation.33 No differences were found in laryngeal preservation, laryngeal function preservation, or overall survival between the 2 regimens. Newer studies, such as DeCIDE (Docetaxel-Based Chemotherapy Plus or Minus IC to Decrease Events in Head and Neck Cancer)34 and PARADIGM (Combination Chemotherapy and Radiation in Treating Patients With Stage III or IV Head and Neck Cancer),35 suggest no overall benefit from the addition of induction chemotherapy vs concomitant chemoradiotherapy alone.\n\nThe higher rate of laryngeal preservation that was achieved with the use of CRT compared with radiotherapy alone was encouraging. Furthermore, no significant increases in the most debilitating radiotherapy-induced toxic effects, such as mucositis/stomatitis and dysphagia, were observed. This treatment approach warrants further evaluation in larger populations to fully assess the potential value of cetuximab or other molecular targeting agents to augment laryngeal preservation rates.\n\nCorrection: This article was corrected on October 26, 2018, to correct an inaccurate conflict of interest disclosure; it was previously corrected on December 15, 2016, to correct errors in number at risk in Figure 2A.\n\nCorresponding Author: James A.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture provided partial funding for the study.\n\nMany foods can have an effect on cholesterol levels, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Foods containing saturated fats, trans fats and dietary cholesterol can raise your cholesterol levels, while foods with healthier fats such as olive oil can lower your cholesterol. Foods with fiber, such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains, can reduce cholesterol levels, while carbohydrates that are low in fiber tend to raise triglyceride levels and lower \"good\" HDL cholesterol levels.\n\nIn the current study, the researchers wanted to assess the long-term effect that apple consumption might have on cardiovascular health.\n\nThey recruited 160 women between the ages of 45 and 65. The women were randomly assigned to one of two dietary intervention groups. One group was given 75 grams of dried apples every day for a year, while the other group was given dried prunes daily for a year.\n\nThe daily serving of dried apples contained about 240 calories, according to the study. An apple contains about 5 grams of fiber, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nThe researchers found that women eating dried apples lowered their total cholesterol by 14 percent. LDL cholesterol dropped by 23 percent. Daily apple consumption also significantly lowered levels of C-reactive protein and lipid hydroperoxide, two substances that may indicate an increased risk of heart disease. What effects, if any, the prunes had on cholesterol levels were not mentioned in the study abstract.\n\nThe researchers theorized that the nutrients in apples may reduce inflammation in the body.\n\nDespite the addition of several hundred calories a day to their diet, the apple-eating women didn't gain weight over the course of the study. In fact, they lost an average of 3.3 pounds.\n\nRegistered dietician Jessica Shapiro said she wasn't surprised that the women didn't gain weight. The addition of apples to the diet probably kept the women feeling fuller because of the fiber content in the apples, she explained.\n\n\"Apples really are an amazing fruit for many reasons,\" said Shapiro, who is a clinical nutritionist who counsels cardiac patients at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City. \"A large reason apples are so good is the fiber. Apples have both soluble and insoluble fiber. Insoluble is found more in the skin, and the pulp is more soluble fiber.\"\n\n\"The pulp of an apple gets to be a very viscous gel-like substance that grabs cholesterol and pulls it out of the body. It's kind of like nature's toothbrush, and it's brushing the bad stuff out,\" she explained.\n\n\"Another good thing in apples is pectin. It's a substance that's used to make jellies or jams, and pectin contributes to the viscosity of what's going through the body, and bulks it up to help remove it. Apples also have tons of antioxidants and other natural components,\" she said.\n\nShapiro said she would recommend fresh apples over dried apples, because some nutrients are probably lost in the drying process.\n\nBut Shapiro stressed that making healthy changes to what you eat can only do so much.\n\n\"Changing your diet can make a big difference, but eating a healthy diet is only part of it. Once your cholesterol is high, diet may not be enough,\" she said. \"Some people are predisposed because of their genes to having high cholesterol, and a healthy diet may not be enough.\"\n\nShapiro also advised against making any changes to your medications, including cholesterol-lowering drugs, without talking to your doctor first.\n\nAlso, she cautioned, when increasing the fiber in your diet, do it slowly.

It is produced when enzymes act to convert a precursor molecule, angiotensinogen. Lisinopril is a member of a drug family called ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors. Other examples of ACE inhibitors are benazepril (Lotensin), enalapril (Vasotec) and ramipril (Altace).\n\nReducing angiotensin production by giving ACE inhibitors can lower blood pressure. The same effect can be achieved with drugs that block the cell receptors through which angiotensin acts. Called angiotensin receptor blockers, these drugs have a greater protective effect against dementia than ACE inhibitors, the study found. Such drugs include candesartan (Atacand), irbesartan (Avapro), losartan (Cozaar) and valsartan (Diovan).\n\nIn the study, men taking an angiotensin receptor blocker had a 24 percent lower incidence of dementia than those taking other cardiovascular drugs. The risk was 19 percent lower for men taking ACE inhibitors. The risk was nearly halved for those taking both angiotensin-targeting drugs.\n\nIn men with Alzheimer's disease, use of an angiotensin receptor blocker reduced admission to nursing homes by half. Combined angiotensin medication therapy reduced nursing home admissions by two-thirds.\n\nWolozin said that it's not clear why the drugs would have a beneficial effect on the brain, but improved blood flow probably plays a role.\n\n\"If you get no blood to the brain, you're not going to think well,\" he said. \"Also, in brain cells there is more than one kind of angiotensin receptor. By blocking bad receptors, you are left with the good ones so that helps neurons become more resilient.\"\n\nBut the evidence is not sufficient to support routine use of angiotensin receptor blockers to prevent Alzheimer's disease, Wolozin said. The new report describes an observational study, one that lacks the strict controls that are needed for convincing proof.\n\n\"Any study like this is hypothesis-generating,\" he said. \"You only know for sure when you have done clinical prospective trials.\"\n\nHis advice for anyone considering angiotensin receptors blockers to reduce dementia risk: \"They should consult with their physicians.\" There are potential hazards, such as too-low blood pressure that can lead to damaging falls, Wolozin said.\n\nCaution was urged by Dr. Richard B. Lipton, vice chairman of neurology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, who has done work on the genetics of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThe angiotensin hypothesis makes sense, Lipton said, because improved blood flow to the brain helps nerve cells and reduces formation of Alzheimer's-related amyloid protein.\n\nBut there have been a number of observational studies implicating various molecules, including estrogens, in dementia, he said. \"The sequence is that when you do the randomized trial, you don't get the same effect,\" Lipton said.\n\nOn the other hand, such randomized trials usually include people who are close to having Alzheimer's disease, and \"it could be different if you gave the drugs earlier,\" Lipton said.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has more on blood pressure medications.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The benefits are given only in relative, not absolute terms.\u00a0 See our primer on this topic.\u00a0 So when the story says \"24 percent lower incidence of dementia\" or \"The risk was 19 percent lower\" or \"The risk was nearly halved\" \u2013 readers need to know 24%\u00a0of what?\u00a0 19% of what?\u00a0 Half of what?

They cause most cases of croup and can cause pneumonia and bronchiolitis \u2014 an inflammation of the small air passages in the lungs.\n\nThere is no treatment or vaccine for parainfluenza.\n\nFludase is already in phase 2 clinical trials for use against influenza. Adding parainfluenza to its approved indications would provide a unique and potentially large market for San Diego-based NexBio.\n\nParainfluenza uses the same receptors \u2014 molecular doorways \u2014 to infect cells as flu does. Fludase inactivates these receptors.\n\nThe researchers said that means patients with flu-like symptoms could get the drug without the need for a test to show whether their infection was caused by influenza or parainfluenza.\n\nThere were some weaknesses in the study. The rats were pre-treated with the drug an hour before they were infected with parainfluenza.

It is the first CDK4/6 inhibitor to be approved for the treatment of breast cancer.\n\n\"All living cells undergo cell division and palbociclib's unique capacity to halt the cell division process (also known as the 'cell cycle') therefore has potentially broad applicability,\" said the study's lead author Amy S. Clark, MD, MSCE, an assistant professor of Hematology/Oncology at Penn's Perelman School of Medicine and ACC. \"Pairing palbociclib with other anti-cancer therapies such as endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy can create a powerful combinatorial effect with real promise for addressing a variety of cancers.\" For example, amplification of CDK4 is reported in a high percentage of melanomas and esophageal cancers.\n\nTargeted therapy uses medication and other interventions to more accurately identify and attack cancer cells, usually while doing no or little damage to normal cells.\n\n\"This drug has minor effects on normal cells other than neutrophils (white blood cells),\" said the study's senior author, Peter J. O'Dwyer, MD, a professor of Hematology/Oncology at Penn and director of the Developmental Therapeutics Program at the ACC. \"In tumors, it can cause shrinkage, or more commonly, arrest of growth. As we discover new functions for the CDK4/6 target of this medicine, we are likely to use it in combinations to make other anti-cancer agents work better.\"\n\nIn addition to inhibiting the cell cycle, palbociclib has been shown, for example to alter several recently described non-cell cycle functions of CDK4/6, a finding expected to expand its therapeutic role, O'Dwyer added.\n\nAssessing 130 relevant publications in the literature, as well as interpreting their own continuing studies, the all-Penn team found that in addition to its safety and effectiveness in fighting certain types of breast cancer, early trials of palbociclib have shown promise of effectiveness in cases of lymphoma, sarcoma, and teratoma, tumors that while rare, often afflict younger patients.\n\nA phase 2 trial showed that, among 17 patients with previously treated mantle-cell lymphoma, palbociclib resulted in one complete response and two partial responses. Although, median progression-free survival was four months, five patients had progression-free survival greater than one year. Another phase 2 trial with 29 sarcoma patients treated with palbociclib showed a progression-free survival of 66 percent at 12 weeks.\n\nAlso, combining palbociclib with other anti-cancer agents is feasible, and early results in myeloma and some solid tumors have led to more definitive studies.\n\nIn both breast and other cancer trials, palbociclib has been shown to be safe with once-daily dosing, and its main adverse effect is reversible neutropenia, an abnormally low count of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that helps fight infections. The lower their neutrophil count, the more vulnerable patients are to infectious diseases. In such cases the drug is temporarily discontinued and reintroduced at a lower dose. Other side effects included fatigue (33 percent), nausea (30 percent), diarrhea (18 percent), constipation (12 percent), and rash (12 percent).\n\nAt the recommended doses, evidence of the desired drug effect in tumors has been obtained using novel PET imaging at Penn.

Nearly half the pregnancies among American women are unintended \u2014 unwanted now or within the next two years. And among sexually active teenagers and young adults, the rate of unplanned pregnancy is even higher.\n\nFully 43 percent of these pregnancies follow incorrect or inconsistent uses of contraception. Of course, some couples fail to use any contraception, but others rely on contraceptive methods that have significant failure rates even when properly used.\n\nThese facts prompted a committee of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists this month to urge its members to introduce women of all ages to the most effective and underused methods of reversible contraception: IUDs and hormonal implants. Once inserted, these long-acting methods remove the risk of patient error when a sexually active woman wishes to avoid pregnancy. Their effectiveness rivals that of sterilization.\n\nIn a 2012 study of 7,486 women aged 14 to 45, long-acting reversible contraceptives, or LARCs, were shown to be 20 times as effective in preventing pregnancy than the pill, contraceptive patch or vaginal ring. The risk of an unwanted pregnancy with these other methods was especially high among women under 21, whose rate of unintended pregnancy was nearly double that among older women.\n\nYet fewer than 10 percent of sexually active women currently rely on long-acting reversible contraception, and a major reason is doctors\u2019 reluctance to recommend them. Only about half of obstetrician-gynecologists offer the implant, the committee said, and many physicians use \u201coverly restrictive criteria\u201d when deciding whether to recommend an IUD, especially for adolescents and women who have not yet been pregnant.\n\nGreater LARC use can reduce birthrates among adolescents and, for women of all ages, a reliance upon abortion to prevent unwanted births, the experts wrote in the October issue of Obstetrics & Gynecology.\n\nFurthermore, the higher upfront costs of LARC methods are no longer an impediment for women with insurance obtained through the Affordable Care Act. Megan L. Kavanaugh, a senior research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, which studies reproductive health, said in an interview that \u201call new insurance plans obtained through the act\u2019s exchanges fully cover all contraceptive methods without any co-payments or other out-of-pocket costs.\u201d Title X family planning clinics and Planned Parenthood clinics are more likely than other sources to offer LARC methods, she said.\n\nIn a paper published two years ago, European experts predicted that \u201cafter decades of dominance by \u2018the Pill,\u2019 it is likely that in the future, long-acting reversible contraceptives will become the first-line contraceptive option, owing to their superior contraceptive effectiveness in real-life use, cost effectiveness as well as their established safety profile.\u201d\n\nHere is a summary of the advantages of LARCs, listed by the committee:\n\n\u25a0 They are independent of the sex act and do not depend on the user\u2019s motivation and reliability.\n\n\u25a0 Compared with other reversible methods, they are more effective and have higher rates of continued use and user satisfaction.\n\n\u25a0 There is no need to get frequent supplies and no additional costs once they are inserted, making them highly cost effective.\n\n\u25a0 There are few contraindications for their use, and fertility returns quickly after removal.\n\nFurthermore, the committee stated, \u201calmost all women are appropriate candidates\u201d for the LARC methods currently available. They are an implant that slowly releases the hormone etonogestrel over a period of three years, and four IUDs: the copper T that can be used for up to 10 years, and three IUDs containing the hormone levonorgestrel (two approved for use up to three years, and one approved for up to five years).\n\nIn real-world use, these methods are associated with a one-year pregnancy rate of less than one per 100 women. In contrast, women using the pill, patch or vaginal ring face an annual pregnancy risk of 9 percent; the diaphragm is associated with a 12 percent pregnancy rate, and with condoms, cervical caps and sponges, the rate is 18 percent.\n\n\u201cWhile there is no one best contraceptive method for every woman or every couple, women should have access to all methods and should know how effective the LARCs are,\u201d Dr. Kavanaugh said.\n\nThe etonogestrel implant is a small plastic rod resembling a matchstick that is inserted under the skin in the upper arm. The hormone, a form of progesterone, prevents ovulation and thickens the cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to reach and fertilize an egg. Though the implant can remain in place and effective for three years, it can also be removed sooner if, for example, a woman decides she wants to become pregnant. Typically with the implant, menstrual bleeding diminishes, and after a year, one woman in three stops having periods. However, some women develop longer, heavier periods, and some have increased spotting between periods.\n\nLikewise with the hormonal IUDs. Levonorgestrel, also a progesterone, changes the cervical mucus, blocking the transport of sperm and fertilization of an egg. It also suppresses growth of the uterine lining and thus reduces cramping and heavy menstrual bleeding. Women using it report a significant reduction in menstrual blood loss.\n\nThe copper IUD does not contain hormones. Rather, the copper is toxic to sperm, preventing them from fertilizing an egg. Because it also prevents a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus, the copper IUD can serve as emergency contraception for up to five days following unprotected intercourse.\n\nBoth the implant and IUD can be used by women who are breast-feeding, as well as those who cannot take estrogen. There are few contraindications; nearly all women are eligible for an implant or IUD, according to guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Unlike early IUDs no longer in use, \u201cmodern IUDs do not carry an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease after the first 20 days following insertion,\u201d Dr. Brooke Winner and her colleagues wrote in The New England Journal of Medicine. With both implants and IUDs, fertility returns quickly as soon as the devices are removed.\n\nCommon side effects include irregular bleeding during the first few months following the insertion of an implant or IUD. The latter is also associated with some cramping at the time of insertion.\n\u2022 The More We Learn on Nutrition, the More We Ignore\n\u2022 Ask Well: Catching Up on Lost Sleep\n\nFor more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story gives figures on the effectiveness of a variety of contraception methods.\nHere is an excerpt:\nIn a 2012 study of 7,486 women aged 14 to 45, long-acting reversible contraceptives, or LARCs, were shown to be 20 times as effective in preventing pregnancy than the pill, contraceptive patch or vaginal ring.

Before considering Noctiva, health care providers should evaluate each patient for possible causes for the nocturia, and optimize the treatment of underlying conditions that may be contributing to the night-time urination. Because Noctiva is approved only for adults with nocturia caused by nocturnal polyuria, health care providers should confirm overproduction of urine at night with a 24-hour urine collection, if one has not been obtained previously. Health care providers should also be mindful of underlying conditions that can cause nocturia, but that make treatment with Noctiva unsafe, such as excessive drinking of fluids or symptomatic congestive heart failure.\n\nNoctiva is taken daily, approximately 30 minutes before going to bed. It works by increasing the absorption of water through the kidneys, which leads to less urine production.\n\nNoctiva\u2019s efficacy was established in two 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in 1,045 patients 50 years of age and older with nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria. Although these trials showed a small reduction in the average number of night-time urinations with Noctiva compared to placebo, more patients treated with Noctiva were able to at least halve their number of night-time urinations, and patients treated with Noctiva had more nights with one or fewer night-time urinations.\n\nNoctiva is being approved with a boxed warning and a Medication Guide because it can cause low sodium levels in the blood (hyponatremia). Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest or death. Health care providers should make sure the patient\u2019s sodium level is normal before starting Noctiva, and should check sodium levels within one week and approximately one month after starting treatment and periodically thereafter. The lower Noctiva dose is recommended as the starting dose for those who may be at risk for hyponatremia, such as the elderly. Noctiva should not be used in patients at increased risk of severe hyponatremia, such as those with excessive fluid intake, those who have illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances, certain patients with kidney damage, and in those using certain medicines, known as loop diuretics or glucocorticoids.\n\nNoctiva should also not be used in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension because fluid retention can worsen these underlying conditions. Use of Noctiva should be discontinued temporarily in patients with certain nasal conditions such as colds or allergies until those conditions have resolved.\n\nNoctiva is also not recommended for the treatment of nocturia in pregnant women. Nocturia is usually related to normal changes in pregnancy that do not require treatment with Noctiva. Noctiva should not be used in children.\n\nThe most common side effects of Noctiva in clinical trials included nasal discomfort, cold symptoms (nasopharyngitis), nasal congestion, sneezing, high or increased blood pressure, back pain, nose bleeds, bronchitis and dizziness.\n\nAlthough there are other FDA-approved medications that also contain desmopressin, none of those medications are approved to treat nocturia.\n\nNoctiva is manufactured by Renaissance Lakewood, LLC for Milford, Pennsylvania-based Serenity Pharmaceuticals, LLC.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

They found that AIM2 deficiency causes uncontrolled proliferation of intestinal cells. Surprisingly, they also discovered that AIM2 influences the microbiota -- the population of gut bacteria -- apparently fostering the proliferation of 'good' bacteria that can protect against colon cancer.\n\nThe team, led by Thirumala-Devi Kanneganti, Ph.D., a member of the St. Jude Department of Immunology, published their findings in a recent issue of the journal Cell. She said that the findings could have important applications for prevention, prognosis and treatment.\n\n'Since reduced AIM2 activity in colorectal cancer patients is associated with poor survival, it might be useful to detect the level of AIM2 expression in polyps taken from colonoscopy and use this as one of the biomarkers for prognosis,' Kanneganti said.\n\nKanneganti and her team believe that it might be possible to prevent the disease or reduce its risk by treating susceptible people to increase AIM2 activity and give them healthy donor bacteria. 'In people who already have colorectal cancer, therapies that boost the expression of AIM2, such as interferons, might reduce tumor progression. Also, transferring healthy microbiota or a group of 'good' bacteria to patients with colorectal cancer at the early stage of disease may prolong survival,' Kanneganti said.\n\nCancer researchers had known that mutations in AIM2 were frequently found in patients with colorectal cancers. And a study by other researchers had found that more than half of small bowel tumors had AIM2 mutations.\n\nHowever, AIM2's established function in the cell was not in the machinery of cancer, said one of the paper's first authors Si Ming Man, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in Kanneganti's laboratory. Rather, he said, AIM2 was known to work in the immune system to detect invading bacteria and viruses and help 'alert' the immune system to battle them.\n\n'When we found that the intestine expressed high levels of AIM2, we hypothesized that this gene may also play a role in regulating gut health,' Man said. 'This was how we became interested in AIM2 and colorectal cancer.'\n\nIn their experiments with mice, the scientists used chemicals to trigger the process mimicking the development of colorectal cancer. They found that the mice showed drastically reduced AIM2 function, confirming the finding in humans with the cancer. They also found that mice genetically altered to have reduced AIM2 function, when treated with the chemicals, showed significantly more tumors than normal mice.\n\nThe scientists' studies also showed that AIM2 played a role independent of its immune role, in suppressing abnormal expansion of intestinal stem cell populations. Conversely, malfunction of AIM2 unleashes abnormal stem cell proliferation. Stem cells are immature cells that differentiate into adult cells such as intestinal cells. These cells continuously proliferate to replace old and dying cells in the intestine.\n\n'Many previous studies have indicated that AIM2 contributes to the immune system by acting as a pathogen sensor,' Man said. 'However, our work is the first to identify AIM2's role in controlling proliferation of intestinal stem cells. This work is truly exciting to us because we have found a new role for AIM2 in regulating colorectal cancer, and it does so by inhibiting excessive proliferation of stem cells in the large intestine.' The researchers also pinpointed the specific cellular machinery regulated by AIM2.\n\nThey decided to explore whether AIM2's protective role might involve gut bacteria, based on studies from Kanneganti's lab and others indicating that microbial sensors similar to AIM2 contributed to healthy gut microbiota. Indeed, the comparison of gut bacteria in normal and AIM2-deficient mice showed a different 'microbial landscape' in the two types of mice.\n\nTo test whether gut bacteria might influence the progression of colon cancer, the researchers housed normal and AIM2-deficient mice together, to enable the exchange of gut bacteria. The scientists found a striking reduction in colon tumors in the AIM2-deficient mice and an increase in tumors in the normal mice.\n\n'What this might suggest is that transfer of some of the 'good' microbiota from wild-type mice to replace the 'bad' microbiota from mice lacking AIM2 offers increased protection against colorectal cancer,' Man said. 'We believe that this finding has important clinical relevance because we can potentially prevent or decelerate the progression of colorectal cancer in humans, especially in those who have mutations in the AIM2 gene, by simply giving them 'good' microbiota.'\n\n'We have only scratched the surface of the role of AIM2 in controlling stem cell proliferation and the maintenance of a healthy gut microbiota,' Kanneganti said. 'How exactly AIM2 does both of these functions is an exciting research area to pursue.'\n\nThe paper's other authors are Qifan Zhu, Liqin Zhu, Zhiping Liu, Rajendra Karki, Ankit Malik, Deepika Sharma, Liyuan Li, R.K.

Families never receive a bill from St. Jude for treatment, travel, housing and food -- because all a family should worry about is helping their child live. To learn more, visit stjude.org or follow St. Jude at @stjuderesearch", "question": "Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The release is overrun with general statements and specificity is mostly missing.The release says that AIM2 suppresses \u201cabnormal expansion of intestinal stem cell populations,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t quantify what that means. How much more proliferation of these stem cell populations was there in mice that had a \u201cmalfunction of AIM2\u201d? And how does stem cell proliferation translate to cancer growth? Similarly, the release noted that when \u201cnormal\u201d mice and AIM2-deficient mice had the opportunity to exchange gut bacteria, \u201cscientists found a striking reduction in colon tumors in the AIM2-deficient mice and an increase in tumors in the normal mice.\u201d But it doesn\u2019t give readers any numbers that tell us how different those tumor numbers were or what that meant in terms of survival rate.\nAlso, importantly, the release does not make clear how much can be inferred about the behavior of AIM2 in humans from the behavior of AIM2 in mice. What level of uncertainty is there? What are \u201cgood bacteria\u201d and how are they transferred to experimental mice?\u00a0 How would that happen in humans?\u00a0 The release speaks of AIM2 findings and suggests possible meanings but fails to provide conclusive evidence to support the researchers\u2019 conjecture.", "answer": 0}]
