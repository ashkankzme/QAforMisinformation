Flublok is the only flu vaccine made in a 100% egg-free system using modern cell culture technology, making it unnecessary to use an infectious influenza virus, antibiotics or harsh chemicals (e.g., formaldehyde) in manufacturing. Flublok is highly purified and does not contain any preservatives (e.g., thimerosal - a form of mercury), egg proteins, gelatin or latex.

In a 2014/15 post-marketing study of 9,000 adults 50 years and older, people who received Flublok were over 40% less likely to develop cell culture confirmed influenza than people who received a traditional flu vaccine.

Results from a pivotal study of the treatment were reported today in the American Heart Association (AHA) journal Circulation Research. Patients with untreatable angina who received the injections of CD34+ stem cells in key areas of the heart had significantly fewer chest pain episodes and significantly better performance on exercise tests than patients who got placebo injections.\n\nDrugs, angioplasty, and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery are the main treatments for angina -- chest pain caused by blocked coronary arteries. About 850,000 Americans have angina that persists despite available treatments. \"These are patients who have been on drugs and may have had multiple angioplasties or CABG surgeries,\" AHA President Gordon Tomaselli, MD, tells WebMD. \"Their activities are severely restricted by their chest pain and right now we have little to offer them.\" The new treatment came from the discovery about a decade ago that CD34+ stem cells stimulate the formation of new blood vessels, study researcher Douglas W. Losordo, MD, of Chicago's Northwestern University tells WebMD. \"Coronary artery disease involves not only the blockage of major arteries, but the death of small vessels, or capillaries, of the heart muscle,\" he says. \"This treatment targets these small vessels that have been damaged. The stem cells have shown the ability to repair and replace them in animal models.\" The approach also showed promise in a 2007 pilot study involving fewer than 30 patients. The newly reported study included 167 patients with severe angina treated at 26 medical centers across the country.\n\nStudy participants received one of three treatments: low-dose CD34+ injections, high-dose injections, or placebo. Patients were given a drug for several days to increase the number of CD34+ stem cells in the blood. Blood was collected and processed to collect the stem cells, and then, using a catheter threaded into the heart, the researchers injected the CD34+ cells into areas of the muscle that had been identified as oxygen-deprived areas.

Age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, is the leading cause of vision loss among seniors, gradually eroding crucial central vision. There are different forms but more than 5 million people worldwide, and a million in the U.S., have an advanced type of so-called \u201cdry\u201d macular degeneration that has no treatment. First patients may notice blurriness when they look straight ahead. Eventually many develop blank spots, becoming legally blind.\n\u201cThese are seniors who are entering their golden years and now they\u2019ve lost the ability to read, watch television, see their loved ones,\u201d said Dr. Rahul Khurana, a retina specialist and spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. The experimental drug, lampalizumab, aims to slow the destruction of light-sensing cells in the retina, creeping lesions that characterize the stage of dry AMD called \u201cgeographic atrophy.\u201d When those cells die, they can\u2019t grow back \u2014 the vision loss is irreversible.\nIn an 18-month study of 129 patients, monthly eye injections of the drug modestly slowed worsening of the disease when compared with patients given dummy shots. What\u2019s exciting for scientists came next, when researchers from drugmaker Genentech Inc. took a closer look at exactly who was being helped. It turns out that nearly 6 in 10 of the study\u2019s participants carry a gene variation that makes part of the immune system go awry \u2014 a genetic flaw already known to increase the risk of getting macular degeneration in the first place. Those are the only patients who appeared to benefit from the drug; they had 44 per cent less eye damage than the untreated patients, the Genentech team reported Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine. While the study is too small to prove if lampalizumab really helps maintain vision, that\u2019s a bigger difference than the overall results suggested.

The effect remained even after the researchers adjusted for other things that can influence heart-disease risk, such as obesity, high blood pressure, smoking, low levels of physical activity and a family history of heart disease.\nThe results are particularly encouraging because they showed that a change in diet could affect heart-disease risk for relatively young women.

In a small study from Spain, lupus patients showed dramatic improvements in skin lesions while taking the drug, lenalidomide (Revlimid), and most relapsed soon after they stopped taking it.\n\nThalidomide is best known as the drug that caused thousands of children to be born with missing limbs and other birth defects in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In more recent years it has been brought back to the market to treat a number of serious conditions, but its use is monitored closely to ensure that it is not taken by women who are pregnant or who might become pregnant. Dermatology professor Andrew G. Franks Jr., MD, of the NYU Langone Medical Center, says thalidomide is very effective for treating people with lupus skin conditions who do not respond to standard treatments such as steroids and antimalarial drugs.

One of the best-known is hearing voices, also known as Auditory Verbal Hallucination (AVH), which around 70% of people with schizophrenia experience at some point. These voices, may be 'heard' as having a variety of different characteristics, for example as internal or external, friendly or threatening, they may be continuously present or present only occasionally, and so on.\nProfessor Sonia Dollfus said: \"Auditory Verbal Hallucinations, or \"hearing voices\" can be a disturbing symptom of schizophrenia, both for patients and for those close to sufferers. This is the first controlled trial to show an improvement in these patients by targeting a specific area of the brain and using high frequency TMS. This means two things; firstly it seems that we now can say with some certainty that we have found a specific anatomical area of the brain associated with auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia. Secondly, we have shown that treatment with high frequency TMS makes a difference to at least some sufferers, although there is a long way to go before we will know if TMS is the best route to treat these patients in the long-term\".\nFor the first time, scientists have precisely identified and targeted an area of the brain which is involved in \"hearing voices\", experienced by many patients with schizophrenia.

Papa and her team expanded on that work by studying how levels of these two proteins, or biomarkers, change immediately after head trauma.\nAnd because levels of GFAP tend to remain higher for many days, Papa says it might be useful in cases where patients don\u2019t come in immediately after a head injury, thinking they\u2019re okay, but see the doctor several days later because they\u2019re concerned.

So Dennis Lam, MD, a researcher at the Joint Shantou International Eye Center of Shantou University and Chinese University of Hong Kong, and his colleagues evaluated 88 children, ages 7 to 12, with the condition known as anisometropic amblyopia, in which there is a difference in the degree of nearsightedness or farsightedness between the two eyes.

The alternative therapy reduced hot flashes by as much as 74% in the study conducted by researchers at Baylor University\u2019s Mind-Body Medicine Research Laboratory and funded by the National Institutes of Health. Only hormone therapy, which many women can\u2019t take or want to avoid, is more effective for treating the most common symptom of menopause, says researcher Gary R. Elkins, PhD. \u201cIf you compare this treatment with off-label use of antidepressants or other non-hormonal therapies, it works as well or better,\u201d he says.\n\nHot flashes are a sudden rush of heat, followed by facial flushing and sweating, often followed by chills and clamminess. The progression is familiar to most women of a certain age. Hot flashes and night sweats are the most common symptoms of menopause, affecting some 80% of women. They are linked to declining estrogen levels, but it remains unclear just why the sudden lack of estrogen sends the body into thermal mayhem, and why some women are more affected than others. Hormone therapy is a very effective treatment for menopause-related hot flashes, but concerns about risks have limited its use among women. \u201cThere is certainly a need for non-pharmacologic treatments for hot flashes and night sweats,\u201d says North American Menopause Society (NAMS) Executive Director Margery Gass, MD.\n\nIn an earlier study, Elkins and his Baylor colleagues showed that hypnosis dramatically reduced hot flash and night sweat frequency in breast cancer patients with treatment-related symptoms. In the newly published study, they set out to determine if the alternative treatment would do the same in women whose symptoms were related to menopause. A total of 187 postmenopausal women who reported having at least seven hot flashes a day, or 50 a week, were recruited for the trial. Half the women were given self-hypnosis training that consisted of five, 45-minute weekly sessions.

The study is available online in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology \u25cf Biology \u25cf Physics, the flagship journal of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO).\n\u201cThis study illustrates that a potentially curative dose of radiation may be delivered safely to the prostate entirely in a single administration,\u201d said Dr. Krauss. \u201cGiving the entire dose in a single treatment theoretically could have had a greater negative impact on the normal tissues in close proximity to the prostate\u2014meaning the bladder, urethra and rectum\u2014but this was not found to be the case.

It is estimated that there are about 1.8 million new cases of lung cancer annually worldwide and about 1.55 million die from the disease each year. The reason for the high mortality rate is that currently most cases are detected when the patient becomes symptomatic, which is usually at late stages of the disease. To date, there is no adequate screening process for the early detection of lung cancer, bringing 5-year survival rate to approximately 15%. In addition, there is a well-defined risk group for developing the disease \u2013 mostly smokers and former smokers above the age of 50. In the US, low-dose CT is available for screening of individuals 55-79 years old who smoked at least 1 pack a day for 30 years, which represent less than half of the lung cancer population. Therefore, a screening test aimed at the entire risk group to assist in the early detection of the disease is highly needed and can dramatically increase lung cancer survival.\n\"We are very excited to present the best published clinically validated results of a blood test for the early detection of lung cancer,\" said Opher Shapira, PhD, CEO of Nucleix. \"Furthermore, these results were validated prospectively in an independent cohort.

The research was presented at the American Association for Cancer Research's special conference, Colorectal Cancer: Biology to Therapy.\n\n''One in every 17 of us will have colon cancer in our lifetime,\" says David Ahlquist, MD, professor of medicine and a consultant in gastroenterology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., who presented his findings on the new colon cancer screening test. Although colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death for men and women in the U.S., many adults don't undergo the screenings once they reach age 50 (or earlier for those with a family history), Ahlquist told a news conference. Estimates of how many adults undergo screening vary, but Ahlquist says probably only 40% adhere to the screening schedule over time.

Patients must often take time off work and need transportation home from the procedure.\n\nThe new test, a next-generation stool test known as a DNA methylation test, detects tumor-specific alterations or methylations in the DNA in the cells shed into the stool from cancerous or precancerous lesions. The test can be done at home without dietary restrictions or bowel preparation.

For the experiment, five women under 40 wore a Fitbit ChargeHR to bed. That\u2019s because resting heart rate data can be captured at its purest when a person is asleep and not moving.

At the time, Colorado was one of only about a dozen states in the U.S. that had legalized medical cannabis. It also allowed sick children to access the drug under professional guidance. Landon became the youngest patient in the U.S. at that time to receive a medical marijuana card. Riddle\u2019s decision to treat her child with cannabis landed the family in the center of a contentious national debate, as well as on prime-time television with CNN\u2019s chief medical correspondent, Sanjay Gupta. In Utah, all cannabis is illegal, so when their story went public, she and Landon had to move permanently to Colorado, so he could continue to have access to the drug.

Initially, her hope was that the drug would lessen the side effects. But Riddle soon heard that certain compounds in cannabis\u2014cannabinoids\u2014have been shown to induce cancer cell death. The theory seemed to be especially promising for leukemia, at least according to studies done on cancer cells in test tubes and on mice injected with human leukemia cells. But at that point there wasn\u2019t any evidence it would work for humans. There still isn\u2019t.

It also found that the protective effect increases with age. The study is by Peter Rothwell, MD, PhD, FRCP, of John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, England, and colleagues, and has been published online by the journal the Lancet. A previous study by the same authors showed that low doses of aspirin (75-300 milligrams) reduced the number of cases of colorectal cancer by a quarter and deaths caused by the disease by more than a third. The latest study confirms the earlier results and concludes that similar effects can be shown for other types of cancers.\n\nThe study looked at eight trials examining the effects of a daily dose of aspirin on preventing heart attacks involving 25,570 patients, 674 of whom died from cancer. They showed a 21% reduction in the number of deaths caused by cancer among those who had taken aspirin, compared with people who had not. The investigation also showed that the benefits of taking aspirin increased over time. After five years, death rates were shown to fall by 34% for all cancers and by 54% for gastrointestinal cancers. Participants were also followed up after 20 years, by which point 1,634 of the original participants had died as a direct result of cancer. This 20-year follow-up established that the risk of cancer death remained 20% lower among those who had been allocated aspirin than those in the control group for all solid cancers, including lung, prostate, brain, bladder, and kidney cancers, and by 35% for gastrointestinal cancers. The fall in the risk of death broke down according to individual types of cancer: Reductions in pancreatic, stomach, and brain cancers were difficult to quantify because of smaller numbers of deaths, the authors say.\n\nThe protective effect of taking low doses of aspirin varied according to the type of cancer and how long aspirin had been taken, the authors found. For instance, it only became apparent after about five years for esophageal, pancreatic, brain, and lung cancer; about 10 years for stomach and colorectal cancer; and about 15 years for prostate cancer.
