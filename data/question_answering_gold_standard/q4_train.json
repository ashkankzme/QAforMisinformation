In the past, these benefits have been hard to test scientifically, largely because study participants who volunteered for meditation programs may have been biased to see them succeed. Practitioners have also made strong and essentially unsubstantiated claims about the powers of meditation, leading heart experts and scientists to be especially skeptical. In fact, in 2005, more than 500 brain researchers signed a petition (albeit an unsuccessful one) to protest a scheduled lecture on the neuroscience of meditation by the Buddhist spiritual icon, the Dalai Lama, at a major conference organized by the Society for Neuroscience.\nThe great lengths to which the researchers of the Circulation study went to make their trial scientifically rigorous, however, should reinforce the results in the eyes of some skeptics. The scientists adjusted for the effects of weight, smoking behavior, and diet, all of which can influence heart attack, stroke and early heart death rates. And while the participants in both groups exercised more and cut back on alcohol during the study, they did so at similar rates, making these changes unlikely to be responsible for the differences in health outcomes either.\nBut while the magnitude of those results is remarkable, the study involved a relatively small number of participants, and did not reveal how meditation may be lowering heart disease risk. On the surface, it\u2019s intuitively obvious that stress management can affect heart health for the better; anxiety and stress cause blood pressure to shoot up and leave us on edge, triggering spikes in heart-harming stress hormones like cortisol.\n", "question": "Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

Zinc gluconate is another salt that has been frequently used in zinc lozenges. However, gluconate binds the zinc ion more tightly than acetate does. Because of the somewhat stronger binding, zinc gluconate has been proposed to be less suitable constituent for lozenges. Although the binding difference between zinc acetate and zinc gluconate is a fact, it is not evident whether that causes significant differences at the clinical level for treating the common cold.\nDr. Hemil\u00e4 also analyzed the dose response relationship between the elemental zinc dose and the observed efficacy in reducing common cold duration. There was no difference in the efficacy between five trials that used 80 to 92 mg of zinc per day and the two trials that used 192 and 207 mg of zinc per day. Thus, zinc doses of over 100 mg per day do not seem to provide any more benefit.\nAccording to Dr. Hemil\u00e4, there is no justification for the popular phrase that \"there is no cure for the common cold\" because of the strong evidence that zinc lozenges can shorten common cold duration by over 30%. However, in future studies the optimal composition of zinc lozenges should be investigated. The optimum frequency of their administration also warrants further investigation.

A small study in Canada in 1997 found that self-exams seemed to improve survival among a subset of women using proper technique. The preferred method, known as the vertical strip, three-pressure test, has proved the most sensitive and least likely to produce false alarms, Steiner said. In the largest and most influential study to date, involving 266,000 women in Shanghai, Steiner said researchers taught an inferior method of exams. She said that could partly explain why the Shanghai study failed to find improved survival. Self-exams also appeal strongly to some younger women, whose main screening test is a manual exam done by a doctor or nurse. Mammography is considered inappropriate for women younger than 40, and many doctors don't recommend it until age 50. If a woman decides to do self-exams, Steiner said, it's important to learn to do them right -- and do them every month without fail. \"Done haphazardly and irregularly, it is probably worse than no breast self-exam at all,\" Steiner said. She encourages women to schedule an appointment devoted to learning the technique, which should take at least a half-hour. A few minutes squeezed into a routine annual exam aren't enough, she said. Steiner said not all doctors are up to speed on breast exam technique, which calls for lying down, not taking a few minutes standing in the shower -- the form pushed for years by physicians and even anti-breast cancer groups. \"It's important to ask, 'Do you feel confident in your own technique and training me how to do it?'\" she said. Nelson cautions women not to skip their mammograms if they don't find lumps during self-exams. But finding a lump also is no reason to panic, given the limited accuracy of the self-test. Litt, the breast cancer survivor, has another piece of advice: \"Do not ignore your own judgment; and be assertive,\" she said. \"You don't get a do-over.\"\nEven though her mammogram showed no sign of cancer, Sandra Litt knew she could feel a lump. She had a second mammogram. Nothing there, the radiologist assured her. \"Then one night, I found the 'nothing there' had grown bigger,\" Litt said. Her self-exam had proved accurate. Two years ago, Litt underwent a double mastectomy and months of chemotherapy to survive an aggressive breast cancer. It defies common sense, she says, for scientists to conclude that breast self-exams do women more harm than good. \"It's a very important tool,\" the 67-year-old Portland woman says. \"Why throw away an important tool?\" A scientific review, published in August by the\nin Portland. She stopped routinely teaching self-exams to patients after the large trials in China and Russia showed no benefit.\n", "question": "Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

One group of researchers, for example, recently worked backward to take on the problematic overlap between depression and bipolar disorder\u2014many bipolar patients are initially and incorrectly diagnosed with depression. The team took urine samples from patients who had been diagnosed with one of the two disorders and looked for differences between the two groups. The results, published in the Journal of Proteome Research, showed that 20 different metabolites differentiated the two groups. Another team of scientists identified differences in the throat bacteria of schizophrenic and healthy people. Previous research had suggested tentative links between immune disorders, which are influenced in part by microbes in the body, and schizophrenia; the new study, published in PeerJ, furthered the possibility that differences in oral bacteria could be associated with the disorder.\nThose working on these sorts of tests see them being implemented in a different setting entirely: when a patient comes into their internist seeking treatment for other conditions. \u201cPsychiatric disorders often present with other diseases such as diabetes and some immune disorders,\u201d says Bahn.

However, white matter hyperintensities are etiologically heterogenous and can include neurodegeneration.\n\u2026\nHowever, our study has several limitations. We only measured food frequency at baseline, which was on average 7 years before the time of MRI WMH assessment (range, 2-14 years), and thus participants could have changed their diet before the MRI was performed. However, dietary patterns appear to be stable in other population-based studies. In addition, despite the use of a valid and reliable food frequency questionnaire to calculate MeDi scores, a potential for both random and systematic misclassification of dietary habits persists, although any misclassification is most likely to be random and thus tending to minimize an association between a MeDi and WMHV. Most studies depend on similar methods, and they are a practical approach, albeit subjective in nature. In addition, we used the traditional MeDi score method to quantify adherence, but this too has limitations because the score is based on the cohort- and sex-specific median values across 9 food categories, which does not readily allow for an examination of dose-dependent associations. However, most population-based studies have used this approach. Although the potential for confounding always exists, the persistence of associations after adjustment for many potential confounders suggests that this form of bias does not account for the associations observed. The MRI study population represents a subcohort of the overall NOMAS cohort and was younger and generally healthier than the full cohort. However, as mentioned previously, we did not observe diet differences between those who were included and excluded, again suggesting that selection into the study cohort did not bias our results.

Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. But because vision damage often occurs gradually, most people with the eye disease do not realize they have it until a good deal of their sight has been lost. If caught early, though, there are medications and procedures that may help treat glaucoma. In the study, researchers were able to predict who was at increased risk of developing the eye disease with some accuracy by measuring blood vessel thickness in the retinas of study participants using a computer-based imaging tool. Those with the narrowest vessels at the beginning of the study were four times more likely to have developed glaucoma a decade later.\n\nAbout 3 million Americans and 60 million people worldwide have glaucoma, and the numbers are projected to rise over the next few decades as the population ages. The disease involves damage to the optic nerve, which relays images from the retina to the brain. Early detection is key, but without regular eye exams, most people don\u2019t know they have a problem, says ophthalmologist Andrew Iwach, MD. He is the executive director of the Glaucoma Center of San Francisco and an associate clinical professor of opthalmology at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cWe call this disease a \u2018thief of vision\u2019 because most people with it have no idea that they have lost sight until it is too late to bring it back,\u201d Iwach says.\n\nIn the study, researchers from the University of Sydney followed nearly 2,500 adults, aged 49 and older, for 10 years. None of the participants had glaucoma when they entered the study. Compared with the group as a whole, those people who were diagnosed with the eye disease during the following decade were older, had higher blood pressure, and were more likely to be female. The researchers concluded that measuring retinal-vessel narrowing could help identify people at risk for glaucoma. But they added that blood pressure and other factors that can contribute to vessel size would need to be considered.

Given the prevalence of chronic pain, high frequency SCS is an exciting advance for our patients.\u201d\nSCS is an increasingly common therapy that delivers electric pulses to the spinal cord, through a small device implanted under the skin, for difficult to treat chronic pain in the trunk and limbs. SCS is reversible and is an important option for chronic pain sufferers who otherwise would rely on opioids or back surgery for relief. The new treatment, called HF10\u2122 therapy, uses proprietary high frequency pulses of 10,000 Hz, compared to traditional SCS which uses frequencies of 40 to 60 Hz. HF10 therapy also provides pain relief without paresthesia \u2013 a stimulation-induced sensation commonly perceived as tingling or buzzing, which masks a patient\u2019s perception of pain \u2013 typical of traditional SCS. These sensations are often distracting or uncomfortable to patients and limit the utility and acceptance of traditional devices. Identifying a new intervention that does not rely on paresthesia to mask pain is novel to SCS and has the potential to improve pain relief and quality of life for these complex patients. In the study, researchers examined 171 patients with chronic back or leg pain who were implanted at 10 comprehensive pain treatment centers. Of these, 90 patients received HF10 therapy, while 81 patients had traditional SCS.\n", "question": "Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

But on the other, the release doesn\u2019t acknowledge the fact that the study wasn\u2019t blinded, which is a very serious limitation in a study to assess pain. The patients knew which treatment they were getting and the study researchers also knew which patients were getting high-frequency vs. traditional SCS. This knowledge has the potential to bias the results of the study. Moreover,\u00a0the non-blinded researchers were free to change patient pain medicines as they saw fit, and neither the release nor the study gives data on these changes: this sort of thing is very likely to lead to spurious results.\nWe\u2019re not saying the release needed to go into detail on every possible limitation of this study, but readers need some sense that there are limitations and drawbacks to a study such as this.

That traditionally involves taking your temperature when your body is at rest, examining your cervical mucus, and recording this data every single day on a calendar. Clue\u2019s study, which ran for 13 months beginning in April 2015, didn\u2019t set out to see whether the Fitbit ChargeHR could identify when a woman becomes pregnant. Rather, it was exploring whether the device could reliably track an already-known occurrence: how a woman\u2019s resting heart rate changes when she\u2019s experiencing rising hormonal levels linked to ovulation. For the experiment, five women under 40 wore a Fitbit ChargeHR to bed. That\u2019s because resting heart rate data can be captured at its purest when a person is asleep and not moving. The women also logged their periods on Clue\u2019s app, and took daily urine tests to track when there was a surge in the key hormones that signaled they were entering ovulation. Researchers were watching all these biometrics as the study participants went through their cycles. A woman\u2019s \u201cfertile window\u201d \u2014 when she\u2019s likeliest to get pregnant \u2014 usually occurs two weeks after the start of her last period, and lasts for about six or seven days, ending on the day of ovulation.\nHowever, H\u00f6gqvist Tabor said, this information by itself should not be used as a birth control method. A woman will be fertile four to five days before her increased resting heart rate will start showing up on a Fitbit \u2014 so having unprotected intercourse during this period could in fact lead to an unintended pregnancy. If you\u2019re curious exactly what kind of increase in resting heart rate you should look out for, Clue hasn\u2019t revealed that information yet, but says it will publish that and other data in a paper later. (H\u00f6gqvist Tabor says it's tricky because it depends on the individual, and can range from a few beats per minute to 10 beats per minute.)\n The Ava bracelet will launch this summer. As a low-risk medical device registered with the Food and Drug Administration, it doesn\u2019t need in-depth review by the agency to be sold, according to the company. By monitoring these multiple biomarkers while a woman is asleep, Ava\u2019s wearable and app can notify her during the five days she\u2019s most fertile, ending in ovulation, according to von Bidder, who says Ava has conducted studies on about 60 people. Von Bidder said it was promising to see that Fitbit might be able to provide heart rate data to women trying to conceive. \u201cBut we also know that heart rate alone will not be enough,\u201d she said. Wearables have a well-worn reputation as step-counting machines.

To assess dental plaque, all subjects utilized a fluorescein mouth rinse, and intraoral photographs were taken under black light imaging.

The release fails to discuss them, except to note that a much bigger trial is in the works to test potential health benefits. For instance, neither the journal article nor the release describe the brushing technique instructions given to study participants. A description of the trial posted at ClinicalTrials.gov indicates that participants were told to brush once a day for one minute, which is less often and briefer than the twice-a-day for two minutes many dentists commonly recommend. Even the Plaque HD label recommends brushing at least twice a day. There is no indication that researchers tracked how often or how long participants actually brushed. Also, participants in this trial used manual toothbrushes, not electric ones, which in some studies seem to do a better job reducing plaque. These features of the trial are important and should have been discussed.\nWhat if the participants using Plaque HD brushed longer than those using the placebo paste, because they could see the stained plaque that was on their teeth? Could it be that brushing frequency and duration are important variables, as some studies of oral cleanliness have found? Is it possible that simply using a timer, so that the participants using the placebo toothpaste brushed just as long, might have minimized differences between the groups?\nThere are some key statistics that are left unexplained in the journal article and not mentioned in the release. For instance, hs-CRP levels actually rose in the placebo group. Why? And if the levels had not changed, as would be expected, would that have wiped out the claimed advantage of Plaque HD? What\u2019s more, the researchers excluded 23 of the 61 participants (38 percent) from the hs-CRP analysis because their baseline levels were already very low.

At the moment, low-dose computerized tomography (LDCT) screening which has been shown to reduce mortality from lung cancer in the very large NLST study is only reimbursed in the US for high-risk individuals. LDCT screening is not reimbursed in Europe or most areas in the world while there is still a debate about its cost and safety. Screening is however necessary in order to identify lung cancer at early, operable, stages for the entire at-risk population so currently, not only CT screening but also methods of molecular screening are being tested. I am therefore very encouraged with the results of this study, showing that EpiCheck has the ability to identify both non-small-cell and small-cell lung cancer at early stages, with a high level of sensitivity and specificity. Such promising results combined with the simplicity of the test, could allow us to detect lung cancer at the early stages and hence improve 5-year survival from about 15% to about 50-70%.

Although it has been a lifesaver for people infected with the virus, antiretroviral medications have significant drawbacks: they can cause severe side effects, and patients have to take them for life. This is why researchers continue to look for other ways to control the virus--and broadly neutralizing antibodies could prove to be part of an alternate treatment strategy.\nIn an effort to accomplish this, the investigators are looking into modified variants of the antibodies with prolonged activity, so that they would need to be given less often in the PrEP setting. And they are already moving forward with new clinical studies using 10-1074 together with 3BNC117, with the hope that combining two antibodies targeting different parts of HIV will be more effective than either antibody on its own.\nThe investigators found that among 13 HIV-infected people who received the highest dose of 10-1074, 11 showed a rapid decline in the amount of virus. Although these patients were found to have some resistant virus in their blood, further research in the lab showed that those viruses were still sensitive to other broadly neutralizing antibodies, including 3BNC117, that target different parts of the pathogen.

It also found that the protective effect increases with age. The study is by Peter Rothwell, MD, PhD, FRCP, of John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, England, and colleagues, and has been published online by the journal the Lancet. A previous study by the same authors showed that low doses of aspirin (75-300 milligrams) reduced the number of cases of colorectal cancer by a quarter and deaths caused by the disease by more than a third. The latest study confirms the earlier results and concludes that similar effects can be shown for other types of cancers.\n\nThe study looked at eight trials examining the effects of a daily dose of aspirin on preventing heart attacks involving 25,570 patients, 674 of whom died from cancer. They showed a 21% reduction in the number of deaths caused by cancer among those who had taken aspirin, compared with people who had not. The investigation also showed that the benefits of taking aspirin increased over time. After five years, death rates were shown to fall by 34% for all cancers and by 54% for gastrointestinal cancers. Participants were also followed up after 20 years, by which point 1,634 of the original participants had died as a direct result of cancer. This 20-year follow-up established that the risk of cancer death remained 20% lower among those who had been allocated aspirin than those in the control group for all solid cancers, including lung, prostate, brain, bladder, and kidney cancers, and by 35% for gastrointestinal cancers. The fall in the risk of death broke down according to individual types of cancer: Reductions in pancreatic, stomach, and brain cancers were difficult to quantify because of smaller numbers of deaths, the authors say.\n\nThe protective effect of taking low doses of aspirin varied according to the type of cancer and how long aspirin had been taken, the authors found. For instance, it only became apparent after about five years for esophageal, pancreatic, brain, and lung cancer; about 10 years for stomach and colorectal cancer; and about 15 years for prostate cancer. Any benefit for lung and esophageal cancer was limited to adenocarcinomas, which are most commonly seen in nonsmokers.", "question": "Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

Last month Allergan revealed that federal prosecutors were investigating it for promoting the non-FDA-approved use of Botox for headaches, though doctors are free to prescribe a drug as they see fit. Allergan says it's cooperating.\nOops. In a reversal of the usual sequence in science, researchers have discovered, after millions of people have received the drug, something fundamental about how Botox can act. Contrary to what turned up in preclinical testing, botulinum toxin can travel along neurons from the injection site into the brain, at least in lab animals. Researchers at Italy's Institute of Neuroscience injected rats and mice with botulinum neurotoxin A in doses comparable to those used in people.

Neurons at the injection site\u2014the whisker muscles\u2014absorbed some of the toxin and passed it along to other neurons they connected to, the researchers report this month in The Journal of Neuroscience. Within three days, the toxin had migrated from the whisker muscles to the brainstem, where it disrupted neuronal activity. \"The discovery was quite serendipitous ... and surprising,\" Matteo Caleo, who led the study, told the journal Science. \"A significant portion of the toxin is active where it's not intended to be.\"\nThat stands in contrast to the findings of earlier studies, which suggested that the neurotoxin is completely broken down at the injection site into innocuous compounds and does not migrate beyond it\u2014or if it does, only into the bloodstream or lymph system.

A CONSORT flow diagram was included with the original publication of the trial.23 A trial profile for the analysis presented here is shown in Figure 1. The primary end point of the study was to examine differences in the rate of locoregional disease control maintained for 1 year. The duration of locoregional control was defined as the absence of locoregional disease progression at the scheduled follow-up visits and was determined through a masked review of the investigator-generated data by an independent committee of experts. The duration of locoregional control was from randomization to the first documented progression or recurrence of locoregional disease or death from any cause. Overall survival was calculated from randomization to death from any cause. Tumor present in a neck dissection, which was performed for any reason after 15 weeks after radiotherapy, constituted locoregional progression. Distribution of time-to-event parameters was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and treatment effects were compared using a log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to calculate the nonstratified hazard ratio (HR). The Kaplan-Meier method was also used to estimate the rate of preservation of larynx.24 Patients who underwent no surgery or lesser operations were censored at death or date of last contact.\nThe analysis described in this report was performed to assess the laryngeal preservation rates of patients with locoregionally advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers who were entered into a randomized clinical trial of cetuximab and radiotherapy (CRT) compared with radiotherapy alone.22,23 This group of patients represents a subgroup (168 patients) of a larger population (424 patients) that also included patients with oropharyngeal cancers.

In a small study from Spain, lupus patients showed dramatic improvements in skin lesions while taking the drug, lenalidomide (Revlimid), and most relapsed soon after they stopped taking it.\n\nThalidomide is best known as the drug that caused thousands of children to be born with missing limbs and other birth defects in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In more recent years it has been brought back to the market to treat a number of serious conditions, but its use is monitored closely to ensure that it is not taken by women who are pregnant or who might become pregnant.

Patients were given a drug for several days to increase the number of CD34+ stem cells in the blood. Blood was collected and processed to collect the stem cells, and then, using a catheter threaded into the heart, the researchers injected the CD34+ cells into areas of the muscle that had been identified as oxygen-deprived areas.

Positive results of a Phase 2 double-blind placebo-controlled study of IVIG for mild to moderate AD were previously reported. The 24 participants in that study underwent 6 months of placebo controlled treatment followed by a\u00a012 month open-label extension in which all subjects received IVIG. To evaluate the long term effects of IVIG, participants were offered additional IVIG treatment at a standardized dose under an IRB-approved extension protocol.\nMethods: Subjects who participated in the Phase 2 study and consented to continuation of treatment were given IVIG (Gammagard, Baxter) 0.4g/kg/2 weeks beginning at post-enrollment month 18. Subjects returned for clinical evaluations at 6 months intervals. A battery of cognitive, functional and behavioral measures were administered at each visit. Adverse events were tracked throughout the study.\nResults: IVIG treatment was well tolerated. A total of 16 of the originally enrolled subjects received treatment through month 36. This included 5/8 originally treated with placebo, and 11/16 given IVIG at various doses from time of randomization. Subjects who were treated with IVIG 0.4g/kg/2 weeks for the full 36 months had the best outcome, with no decline in ADAS-Cog, CGIC, 3MS, ADCS-ADL, NPI or QOL measures at the 3 year endpoint. In contrast, subjects treated with placebo initially or IVIG at other doses declined significantly.\nConclusions: This is the first study to report long term stabilization of AD symptoms with IVIG treatment over a period of 36 months.

We assessed whether the patients had received a dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan and osteoporosis treatment within six months following the injury.\u201d That means that fewer than 100 men were included in this group. Of those, 17 were scanned, and nine were diagnosed with osteoporosis. That\u2019s a pretty small number to start pushing new national protocols. That caveat and the fact that the study was a backward looking review of medical records should have been mentioned.\nWe also question the story\u2019s failure to explore the evidence underlying the expert and society recommendations that it references to support the benefits of screening. Because fragility fractures are much less common in men than they are in women, they have not been studied in randomized trials in the same way that they have in women.

Over all, people who received cortisone shots had a much lower rate of full recovery than those who did nothing or who underwent physical therapy.

The evidence for cortisone as a treatment for other aching tendons, like sore shoulders and Achilles-tendon pain, was slight and conflicting, the review found. But in terms of tennis elbow, the shots seemed to actually be counterproductive. As Bill Vicenzino, the chairman of sports physiotherapy at the University of Queensland in Australia and senior author of the review, said in an e-mail response to questions, \u201cThere is a tendency\u201d among tennis-elbow sufferers \u201cfor the majority (70-90 percent) of those following a wait-and-see policy to get better\u201d after six months to a year.

It says, \u201cThe new work looked at 933 women with colon cancer, whose average age was just over 70. The researchers then found a comparison group of women without the disease, who matched the first group in age, ethnicity and clinics where they received treatment.\u201d Unlike the HealthDay story, this story made note of a similar study that did not show the same level of benefit. It says, \u201cJacobs of the American Cancer Society added that one earlier study from the UK had found no link between bisphosphonate and colon cancer. Indeed, it found a higher risk of throat cancer in patients on the medication.\u201d The big problem with both stories, though, is that they both fail to point out that this study did not look at 933 women who took the drugs and 933 who did not. Of those 1,866 women, only 97 of the cancer patients took the drugs, and only 138 of the women without cancer had taken them. So, yes, the researchers were able to find what appears to be a statistically significant risk reduction, but they also found differences in physical activity, body mass index, vegetable intake and the use of statins and aspirin. The study highlights the biophosphonate connection, but the story should have explained why a difference of 41 women without cancer taking these drugs out of a total of nearly 2,000 would be enough evidence to get really excited about.\nAlso, evaluating the quality of the evidence requires acknowledging this type of study can only assess relative risk. It cannot provide an assessment of the absolute benefit of using the medicine vs. not using it. This is a key limitation of the study design. This type of study can only identify if a relationship may exist between the medicine and colon cancer. It can\u2019t say how big the effect is. That requires a different type of study. So evaluating the quality of the evidence involves acknowledging the relationship between the medicine and less cancer. This study cannot determine whether this relationship is \u201creal\u201d or truly measure the magnitude of the benefit. Here is where both stories fell flat by not discussing the huge limitations of trying to control for differences between women who took the medicine and those who didn\u2019t. We know that people who engage in preventive behaviors such as taking a bisphosphonate may also engage in other healthy behaviors that may relate to lower risk of cancer. So it may not be the bisphosphonate but rather another factor not controlled for that distinguishes patients who took the medicine from those who didn\u2019t.

The phrase \"too posh to push\" predates Posh Spice, but reports that celebrities such as Posh (Victoria Beckham) and Britney Spears had Caesareans have popularized the procedure, some doctors say. And some women are scheduling them early.

If it is funded, it would start next year and take 18 months from then to bear results. Most of the evidence is in rats.\u00a0The study of 66 humans involved (in part) people already known to have brain injuries. FDA approval of the test is conditional on the completion (and funding) of the Defense Department study, which implies that the study is a late-stage, pivotal investigation of the technique in a clinical setting.\nThe trouble is, the article doesn\u2019t evaluate any of these points. Laboratory studies in rats and humans don\u2019t prove ideas but generate ideas. We don\u2019t know whether some future blood test will reliably identify serious cases that are missed by conventional techniques, change treatment plans, save lives, reduce long-term rehabilitation, or prevent what happened to Natasha Richardson. No one can say this technique will be better than what doctors already do, which is why the FDA won\u2019t touch it yet.\u00a0Not only do we not know the answer, we\u2019ve yet to ask the question.\u00a0None of the evidence mentioned has tested a diagnostic technique prospectively or compared it to another approach. \nThat context won\u2019t be clear for a lay reader, who won\u2019t see that the claims are\u00a0remarkably premature.\nThe presumably independent source, Dr. Hall, explains that \"the Banyan work\" does show\u00a0that these biomarkers can reliably track brain injury and are copious enough to be reliably detected.

In other words, we\u2019re not told what that number means.\nThe article is also vague about evidence from \"more than 300 human brain-injury patients\" regarding \"certain biomarkers.\" On its face, in a sea of rat research, that could be the highest-quality aspect of this evidence\u2026if we know anything about them. We presume from the detail about the study of 66 people that the 300 are all laboratory research. But of what biomarkers? All UCH-L1? Several other biomarkers of brain injury have been studied in the past. Which biomarkers would the DOD study look at \u2014 is it all about UCH-L1?
