But the image that viewers may find most shocking is that of a baby being cut out of a woman's abdomen via Caesarean. This, according to Lake, the executive producer of the film, and Abby Epstein, the film's director, is the right reaction: one of their messages is that C-sections should only be performed when needed to guarantee the well-being of the mother and infant, and should not be a first choice for healthy mothers. New research into the risks associated with elective Caesareans supports their view. In a study, published in October's British Medical Journal, of 97,000 deliveries in 410 Latin American hospitals, perinatal specialist Dr. Jose Villar found the risk of death for mothers who had Caesareans, while slight (.01 percent of the women who delivered vaginally died vs. .04 percent who had elective C-sections), was triple that of those who delivered vaginally. \"The C-section increases risk because it's major surgery,\" Villar says. Mothers who had undergone a Caesarean were also more likely to need blood transfusions and stay in the hospital more than a week after delivery. The risk of death for infants delivered via C-section\u2014who are more likely to have a low birth weight\u2014was double that of vaginal births, and C-section babies were more likely to have respiratory problems. According to a study published in the journal Birth, labor clears liquid from the infant's lungs, preparing the baby to breathe outside the womb. Caesareans impede this process. Yet the rate of Caesareans is spiking: in 2006, C-sections accounted for 31.1 percent of births nationwide, a 50 percent increase over the past 10 years. Natural birth\u2014without drugs or interventions\u2014whether at home or in a hospital, remains a rarity (despite the fact that home births don't have an appreciably higher risk rate than hospital births).\nAlthough the United States has one the highest rates of Caesareans\u2014and of infant mortality\u2014Villar says the rest of the developed world is catching up. But opinion differs on how to respond. Doctors such as Stark say we need a better sense of what goes on while the baby is still in utero. \"One of the knowledge gaps is a clear understanding of the indications for C-sections,\" she says. (Known indications include breech position of the fetus, and pre-existing medical conditions such as extreme hypertension in the mother.) Naomi Wolf, author of \"Misconceptions: Truth, Lies, and the Unexpected on the Journey to Motherhood,\" blames insurance companies and hospitals, who she says deny women information about their choices. Wolf and other natural-birth advocates say we need a better idea of what normal birth looks like, as movies and TV usually depict the process as painful and bloody. \"We all have this idea that normal birth is a woman lying in a hospital bed screaming,\" says Block. If nothing else, \"The Business of Being Born,\" with its indelible image of a naked, exhilarated Ricki Lake cooing \"Hi there!\" to her seconds-old son in her bathtub, will give them another view.\nAmid the controversy over what constitutes an ideal birth experience, doctors, researchers and natural-birth advocates agree: Caesareans save lives when medically necessary. But defining medical necessity is complicated. Natural-birth advocates cite a \"cascade of interventions\" caused by hospitals' practice of using the drug Pitocin to stimulate labor. The drug can cause painful contractions, which doctors treat with an epidural painkiller. The epidural can then retard contractions and lead to more drugs, fetal stress and the doctor's recommendation of a Caesarean. Natural-birth advocates say that hospitals, driven by profits and worried about malpractice, are too quick to intervene. \"I compare it to a restaurant. If you have customers who sit at a table and don't order anything, you're not making any money,\" says Jennifer Block, author of \"Pushed: The Painful Truth About Childbirth and Modern Maternity Care.\" Normal labor, Block says, isn't profitable (according to \"The Business of Being Born,\" a Caesarean can cost three times as much as a normal birth). If something does go wrong, in the eyes of the courts \"a normal birth is a risk. The courts reward action,\" Block says.\n", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "Because the story quotes multiple sources, the reader can assume that the story did not rely on a press release as the sole source of information.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Eric Frederick Trump is a science journalist and a research associate of the Trauma and Violence Interdisciplinary Studies Program at New York University.

''Acupuncture could potentially become an alternative treatment to occlusion [patching] therapy for ambylopia [lazy eye], the researchers write. The study, conducted in China, is published in the Archives of Ophthalmology. U.S. experts familiar with the study call it interesting but say the treatment needs more study and wonder if it would catch on in the U.S.\n\nWhile some previous research has found acupuncture for lazy eye effective, the researchers couldn't find a study that directly compared acupuncture with conventional treatments such as patching. So Dennis Lam, MD, a researcher at the Joint Shantou International Eye Center of Shantou University and Chinese University of Hong Kong, and his colleagues evaluated 88 children, ages 7 to 12, with the condition known as anisometropic amblyopia, in which there is a difference in the degree of nearsightedness or farsightedness between the two eyes. They assigned 43 children to the acupuncture group, and they received five treatments a week. Acupuncturists used five different points in the head, face, hand, and leg. The children were instructed to do an hour per day of near-vision activities such as homework or computer work. Another 45 children wore a patch over their normal eye for two hours daily, a typical regimen, and were also asked to do an hour of near-vision activity a day.\n\nAt 15 weeks, visual acuity with eyeglasses improved by about 1.8 lines on the vision chart in the patched eyes and 2.3 lines in those who had acupuncture. An improvement of two lines or more occurred in nearly 67% of those in the patching group but nearly 76% of those in the acupuncture group. Ambylopia was evaluated as resolved in nearly 17% of patched eyes but nearly 42% of the acupuncture group. ''These results suggest that the treatment effect of acupuncture is equivalent to that of patching for anisometropic amblyopia in older children,\" Lam writes.

Even those who didn't stick to the diet perfectly but followed it \"moderately well\" reduced their risk of Alzheimer's by about a third. Diet appears to be just one of \"many factors that play into who gets the disease,\" said nutritional epidemiologist Martha Clare Morris, PhD, the lead author of the MIND diet study. Genetics and other factors like smoking, exercise and education also play a role. But the MIND diet helped slow the rate of cognitive decline and protect against Alzheimer's regardless of other risk factors. The study, published in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia, looked at more than 900 people between the ages of 58 and 98 who filled out food questionnaires and underwent repeated neurological testing. It found participants whose diets most closely followed the MIND recommendations had a level of cognitive function the equivalent of a person 7.5 years younger. The MIND diet breaks its recommendations down into 10 \"brain healthy food groups\" a person should eat and five \"unhealthy food groups\" to avoid. It combines many elements of two other popular nutrition plans which have been proven to benefit heart health: the Mediterranean diet and the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet. (MIND stands for Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay.)

Results from a pivotal study of the treatment were reported today in the American Heart Association (AHA) journal Circulation Research. Patients with untreatable angina who received the injections of CD34+ stem cells in key areas of the heart had significantly fewer chest pain episodes and significantly better performance on exercise tests than patients who got placebo injections.\n\nDrugs, angioplasty, and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery are the main treatments for angina -- chest pain caused by blocked coronary arteries. About 850,000 Americans have angina that persists despite available treatments. \"These are patients who have been on drugs and may have had multiple angioplasties or CABG surgeries,\" AHA President Gordon Tomaselli, MD, tells WebMD. \"Their activities are severely restricted by their chest pain and right now we have little to offer them.\" The new treatment came from the discovery about a decade ago that CD34+ stem cells stimulate the formation of new blood vessels, study researcher Douglas W. Losordo, MD, of Chicago's Northwestern University tells WebMD. \"Coronary artery disease involves not only the blockage of major arteries, but the death of small vessels, or capillaries, of the heart muscle,\" he says. \"This treatment targets these small vessels that have been damaged. The stem cells have shown the ability to repair and replace them in animal models.\" The approach also showed promise in a 2007 pilot study involving fewer than 30 patients. The newly reported study included 167 patients with severe angina treated at 26 medical centers across the country.\n\nStudy participants received one of three treatments: low-dose CD34+ injections, high-dose injections, or placebo. Patients were given a drug for several days to increase the number of CD34+ stem cells in the blood. Blood was collected and processed to collect the stem cells, and then, using a catheter threaded into the heart, the researchers injected the CD34+ cells into areas of the muscle that had been identified as oxygen-deprived areas.

That traditionally involves taking your temperature when your body is at rest, examining your cervical mucus, and recording this data every single day on a calendar. Clue\u2019s study, which ran for 13 months beginning in April 2015, didn\u2019t set out to see whether the Fitbit ChargeHR could identify when a woman becomes pregnant. Rather, it was exploring whether the device could reliably track an already-known occurrence: how a woman\u2019s resting heart rate changes when she\u2019s experiencing rising hormonal levels linked to ovulation. For the experiment, five women under 40 wore a Fitbit ChargeHR to bed. That\u2019s because resting heart rate data can be captured at its purest when a person is asleep and not moving. The women also logged their periods on Clue\u2019s app, and took daily urine tests to track when there was a surge in the key hormones that signaled they were entering ovulation. Researchers were watching all these biometrics as the study participants went through their cycles. A woman\u2019s \u201cfertile window\u201d \u2014 when she\u2019s likeliest to get pregnant \u2014 usually occurs two weeks after the start of her last period, and lasts for about six or seven days, ending on the day of ovulation.\n Fitbits aren't the only wearables that can track fertility-related biometrics in the background.

Only hormone therapy, which many women can\u2019t take or want to avoid, is more effective for treating the most common symptom of menopause, says researcher Gary R.

The progression is familiar to most women of a certain age. Hot flashes and night sweats are the most common symptoms of menopause, affecting some 80% of women. They are linked to declining estrogen levels, but it remains unclear just why the sudden lack of estrogen sends the body into thermal mayhem, and why some women are more affected than others. Hormone therapy is a very effective treatment for menopause-related hot flashes, but concerns about risks have limited its use among women. \u201cThere is certainly a need for non-pharmacologic treatments for hot flashes and night sweats,\u201d says North American Menopause Society (NAMS) Executive Director Margery Gass, MD.\n\nIn an earlier study, Elkins and his Baylor colleagues showed that hypnosis dramatically reduced hot flash and night sweat frequency in breast cancer patients with treatment-related symptoms.

Half the women were given self-hypnosis training that consisted of five, 45-minute weekly sessions.

In recent years, the FDA has approved six drugs for men with metastatic disease, all of which can increase survival. In a study published in Urology\u00ae, researchers demonstrate for the first time that an aggressive combination of systemic therapy (drug treatment) with local therapy (surgery and radiation) directed at both the primary tumor and metastasis can eliminate all detectable disease in selected patients with metastatic prostate cancer.\nAccording to lead investigator Howard I. Scher, MD, Chief of the Genitourinary Oncology Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, \"The sequential use of the three different modalities helped illustrate the role and importance of each in achieving the undetectable PSA with normal testosterone level end point, which represents a 'no-evidence of disease' status.\" Longer follow-up is needed to determine whether these patients were in fact cured.\nWhile the study is only a first step, one-fifth of the patients treated had no detectable disease, with an undetectable prostate-specific-androgen (PSA) and normal blood testosterone, after 20 months. The results suggest that some men who have previously been considered incurable can possibly be cured; investigators also establish a new paradigm for testing various drug combinations in conjunction with local treatment of the prostate to determine which is the best approach (ie, has the highest undetectable disease rate).

It also found that the protective effect increases with age. The study is by Peter Rothwell, MD, PhD, FRCP, of John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, England, and colleagues, and has been published online by the journal the Lancet. A previous study by the same authors showed that low doses of aspirin (75-300 milligrams) reduced the number of cases of colorectal cancer by a quarter and deaths caused by the disease by more than a third. The latest study confirms the earlier results and concludes that similar effects can be shown for other types of cancers.\n\nThe study looked at eight trials examining the effects of a daily dose of aspirin on preventing heart attacks involving 25,570 patients, 674 of whom died from cancer. They showed a 21% reduction in the number of deaths caused by cancer among those who had taken aspirin, compared with people who had not. The investigation also showed that the benefits of taking aspirin increased over time. After five years, death rates were shown to fall by 34% for all cancers and by 54% for gastrointestinal cancers. Participants were also followed up after 20 years, by which point 1,634 of the original participants had died as a direct result of cancer. This 20-year follow-up established that the risk of cancer death remained 20% lower among those who had been allocated aspirin than those in the control group for all solid cancers, including lung, prostate, brain, bladder, and kidney cancers, and by 35% for gastrointestinal cancers. The fall in the risk of death broke down according to individual types of cancer: Reductions in pancreatic, stomach, and brain cancers were difficult to quantify because of smaller numbers of deaths, the authors say.\n\nThe protective effect of taking low doses of aspirin varied according to the type of cancer and how long aspirin had been taken, the authors found. For instance, it only became apparent after about five years for esophageal, pancreatic, brain, and lung cancer; about 10 years for stomach and colorectal cancer; and about 15 years for prostate cancer. Any benefit for lung and esophageal cancer was limited to adenocarcinomas, which are most commonly seen in nonsmokers.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "This story does not appear to rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The requested URL /usnews/health/articles/061015/23addict.b.htm was not found on this server.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "Because two independent sources were quoted, it is unlikely this story was based solely or largely on a news release.

Previously, it had advised women to begin annual or biannual screening at 40.

Ketamine infusion therapy, the controversial treatment for depression, has been resisted by many physicians due to concerns about short-lived benefits, risks of addiction, and the lack of large scale studies. In contrast, this retrospective study of over three years of clinical experience, shows lasting benefits for many patients, with no apparent risk of addiction. Through a handful of ketamine infusions directed by Theodore Henderson, MD, PhD, refractory depression symptoms can be relieved significantly and persistently. Evidence points to the regeneration of brain cells as a critical mechanism for the relief of depression, as published in peer-reviewed journal Neural Regeneration Research, February 2016 issue.\nThe study, \"Practical application of the neuroregenerative properties of ketamine: real world treatment experience,\" addresses key points in the controversy surrounding the use of intravenous ketamine for the treatment of depression.

North American allergy experts tell WebMD that although they find the preliminary findings fascinating, further study is needed before they would recommend the herbs. Yoshiteru Shimoide, MD, head of the Yoshiteru Shimoide Clinic of Internal Medicine in Kagoshima City, Japan, presented the results here at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology (AAAAI).\n\nAsthma on the Rise in U.S. The number of people in the U.S. with asthma is growing. One in 12 people had asthma in 2009, compared with 1 in 14 in 2001, according to the CDC. There is no cure, but most people can control their symptoms, reduce the severity of their disease, and prevent asthma attacks by avoiding asthma triggers and correctly using prescribed medicines, such as steroid inhalers, the CDC says. There's much room for improvement, Shimoide says. He says it was accidentally discovered that kampo herbs could wipe out symptoms in many people while testing the ancient remedy against an allergic skin disorder known as atopic dermatitis. So his team studied 278 people with asthma who suffered daily symptoms of the disease. Of those, 52 were given standard treatment (typically an inhaled steroid and a bronchodilator), and 226 were treated with kampo herbs. Symptoms completely disappeared in 94% of patients taking kampo herbs after an average of 16 days, Shimoide says. In contrast, about three-fourths of those taking standard asthma medications still had daily wheeze and other symptoms.\n\nThe study did not look at possible side effects of kampo herbs. But a major problem facing kampo medicine is herbal product quality. There have been cases in which poisonous plants found their way into the herbal mix, resulting in kidney damage, for example. In kampo medicine, most herbs are taken as a fixed formula. Each individual herb is thought to address a particular imbalance in an ill person.

Age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, is the leading cause of vision loss among seniors, gradually eroding crucial central vision. There are different forms but more than 5 million people worldwide, and a million in the U.S., have an advanced type of so-called \u201cdry\u201d macular degeneration that has no treatment.

It turns out that nearly 6 in 10 of the study\u2019s participants carry a gene variation that makes part of the immune system go awry \u2014 a genetic flaw already known to increase the risk of getting macular degeneration in the first place. Those are the only patients who appeared to benefit from the drug; they had 44 per cent less eye damage than the untreated patients, the Genentech team reported Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine. While the study is too small to prove if lampalizumab really helps maintain vision, that\u2019s a bigger difference than the overall results suggested.

Beginning in 2003, the American Heart Association started to provide guidelines on how doctors should use CRP testing; for patients like those in the current trial, the group did not see any additional benefit to CRP testing since those patients should already be treated with statins, which can lower both cholesterol and inflammation.\nMORE: Why Inflammation in Your Mouth May Raise Your Risk of Cancer\nBut in a new paper published in the and presented at the European Society of Cardiology meeting, scientists say they now have proof that lowering inflammation alone, without affecting cholesterol, also reduces the risk of a heart attack.\n", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not appear to rely on the news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Hot flashes, which mostly affect women transitioning to menopause and already in that phase of life, involve a sudden sensation of heat, sometimes accompanied by sweating or visible reddening of the skin.\nAnd for now, he noted, it\u2019s also not clear why antidepressants would have effects on hot flashes.\nAnd right now, HRT is the only treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for cooling hot flashes.\n", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The article does not appear to rely solely on a press release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Regular aspirin use can also cause side effects, like stomach bleeding and ulcers.

For instance, they provide a means to search for tumors in outer parts of the breast where mammography may not reach. About half of breast cancers develop in the upper-outer quadrant of the breast, which is largely inaccessible to mammography scanners. A small study in Canada in 1997 found that self-exams seemed to improve survival among a subset of women using proper technique. The preferred method, known as the vertical strip, three-pressure test, has proved the most sensitive and least likely to produce false alarms, Steiner said. In the largest and most influential study to date, involving 266,000 women in Shanghai, Steiner said researchers taught an inferior method of exams. She said that could partly explain why the Shanghai study failed to find improved survival. Self-exams also appeal strongly to some younger women, whose main screening test is a manual exam done by a doctor or nurse. Mammography is considered inappropriate for women younger than 40, and many doctors don't recommend it until age 50. If a woman decides to do self-exams, Steiner said, it's important to learn to do them right -- and do them every month without fail. \"Done haphazardly and irregularly, it is probably worse than no breast self-exam at all,\" Steiner said. She encourages women to schedule an appointment devoted to learning the technique, which should take at least a half-hour. A few minutes squeezed into a routine annual exam aren't enough, she said. Steiner said not all doctors are up to speed on breast exam technique, which calls for lying down, not taking a few minutes standing in the shower -- the form pushed for years by physicians and even anti-breast cancer groups. \"It's important to ask, 'Do you feel confident in your own technique and training me how to do it?'\" she said. Nelson cautions women not to skip their mammograms if they don't find lumps during self-exams. But finding a lump also is no reason to panic, given the limited accuracy of the self-test. Litt, the breast cancer survivor, has another piece of advice: \"Do not ignore your own judgment; and be assertive,\" she said. \"You don't get a do-over.\"\nin Portland.
