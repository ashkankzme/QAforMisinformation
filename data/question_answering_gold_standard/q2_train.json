Charney, MD, Anne and Joel Ehrenkranz Dean and Professor of Psychiatry, Neuroscience, and Pharmacological Sciences. The underlying mechanism for MDD that the intervention targets involves an imbalance in the activity of specific brain regions: individuals with MDD show hyperactivity of neural systems involved in emotion processing, such as the amygdala, coupled with decreased activity of systems involved in cognitive control and emotion regulation, such as the prefrontal cortex. The amygdala processes incoming emotionally salient stimuli, whereas the prefrontal cortex, as the executive center of the brain, decides whether the incoming stimuli are noteworthy.\nPatients using this therapeutic are asked to identify an emotion displayed in a series of faces, and for each face, they are asked to identify the number of faces earlier in the series in which they encountered the same emotion. This aims to balance brain activity in these regions to work in concert with each other. In the trial, the therapeutic reduced MDD symptoms by 42 percent in the experimental group after six weeks compared to 15.7 percent in the control group, which was given a similar task using simple shapes instead of emotions. \"The aim is to target the thinking abnormality we see in patients with MDD - that of perseverating, ruminating, obsessing, dwelling on the negative - by activating these two nodes (emotion processing and cognitive control) simultaneously. Thus, higher cognitive control regions will stay active even while the brain is processing salient emotional stimuli, giving the individual the capacity to shift their mindfulness and attention so that they are not perseverating,\" said Dr. Iacoviello. The initial results demonstrate that the efficacy of this digital therapeutic is comparable to drug therapy, with a highly favorable safety profile. Dr. Iacoviello added, \"We will be advancing these encouraging results to the next level, by incorporating this therapeutic into a highly engaging mobile platform and launching it through the CNI platform. It's exciting to have the opportunity to test the program within a large health care system such as Mount Sinai.\"\n", "question": "Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The release provides only percentages, with no actual numbers for the patients who did and did not receive the therapy.

In the study, researchers were able to predict who was at increased risk of developing the eye disease with some accuracy by measuring blood vessel thickness in the retinas of study participants using a computer-based imaging tool. Those with the narrowest vessels at the beginning of the study were four times more likely to have developed glaucoma a decade later.\n\nAbout 3 million Americans and 60 million people worldwide have glaucoma, and the numbers are projected to rise over the next few decades as the population ages. The disease involves damage to the optic nerve, which relays images from the retina to the brain. Early detection is key, but without regular eye exams, most people don\u2019t know they have a problem, says ophthalmologist Andrew Iwach, MD. He is the executive director of the Glaucoma Center of San Francisco and an associate clinical professor of opthalmology at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cWe call this disease a \u2018thief of vision\u2019 because most people with it have no idea that they have lost sight until it is too late to bring it back,\u201d Iwach says.\n\nIn the study, researchers from the University of Sydney followed nearly 2,500 adults, aged 49 and older, for 10 years. None of the participants had glaucoma when they entered the study. Compared with the group as a whole, those people who were diagnosed with the eye disease during the following decade were older, had higher blood pressure, and were more likely to be female. The researchers concluded that measuring retinal-vessel narrowing could help identify people at risk for glaucoma. But they added that blood pressure and other factors that can contribute to vessel size would need to be considered.

Among pregnant women with severe flu illness who were treated early -- within two days of the start of symptoms -- the median length of stay was about five days shorter compared to hospitalized pregnant women with severe flu illness who were treated later (2.2 days vs. 7.8 days).

It is estimated that there are about 1.8 million new cases of lung cancer annually worldwide and about 1.55 million die from the disease each year. The reason for the high mortality rate is that currently most cases are detected when the patient becomes symptomatic, which is usually at late stages of the disease. To date, there is no adequate screening process for the early detection of lung cancer, bringing 5-year survival rate to approximately 15%. In addition, there is a well-defined risk group for developing the disease \u2013 mostly smokers and former smokers above the age of 50. In the US, low-dose CT is available for screening of individuals 55-79 years old who smoked at least 1 pack a day for 30 years, which represent less than half of the lung cancer population. Therefore, a screening test aimed at the entire risk group to assist in the early detection of the disease is highly needed and can dramatically increase lung cancer survival.\nIn the study, blood was prospectively collected from 20 centers and 3 biobanks in Europe and Israel. The samples were used for detection of lung cancer with the Lung EpiCheck blood test. Lung EpiCheck was validated on this independent test set comprising 181 lung cancer cases and 141 current or former smoker controls. Results show specificity of 91% and a sensitivity of 74% with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 89%. These results demonstrated similar performance to the preceding training set results from 102 lung cancer cases and 265 current or former smoker controls.\n\"Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer worldwide due to the high incidence of the disease, and the low rate of diagnosis at early and more curable stages,\" stated Prof. Mina Gaga, the President of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and a lead investigator in the study. \"Clearly, we must establish screening programs for lung cancer worldwide. At the moment, low-dose computerized tomography (LDCT) screening which has been shown to reduce mortality from lung cancer in the very large NLST study is only reimbursed in the US for high-risk individuals. LDCT screening is not reimbursed in Europe or most areas in the world while there is still a debate about its cost and safety. Screening is however necessary in order to identify lung cancer at early, operable, stages for the entire at-risk population so currently, not only CT screening but also methods of molecular screening are being tested. I am therefore very encouraged with the results of this study, showing that EpiCheck has the ability to identify both non-small-cell and small-cell lung cancer at early stages, with a high level of sensitivity and specificity. Such promising results combined with the simplicity of the test, could allow us to detect lung cancer at the early stages and hence improve 5-year survival from about 15% to about 50-70%.

The\u00a0release claims that the test will assist with the early detection of lung cancer in people who are seemingly healthy.

However, no guidelines currently exist to aid clinicians in deciding when to use these more flexible implants, which are often more expensive than conventional implants, may not be medically necessary, and may carry added risks if implanted unnecessarily.\nFor the study, researchers reviewed data on 1,082 total hip replacements performed using computer navigation between January 2014 and December 2015, during which period no dual-mobility implants were used. The overall implant dislocation rate among this cohort was found to be 1.8 percent.

But defining medical necessity is complicated. Natural-birth advocates cite a \"cascade of interventions\" caused by hospitals' practice of using the drug Pitocin to stimulate labor. The drug can cause painful contractions, which doctors treat with an epidural painkiller. The epidural can then retard contractions and lead to more drugs, fetal stress and the doctor's recommendation of a Caesarean. Natural-birth advocates say that hospitals, driven by profits and worried about malpractice, are too quick to intervene. \"I compare it to a restaurant. If you have customers who sit at a table and don't order anything, you're not making any money,\" says Jennifer Block, author of \"Pushed: The Painful Truth About Childbirth and Modern Maternity Care.\" Normal labor, Block says, isn't profitable (according to \"The Business of Being Born,\" a Caesarean can cost three times as much as a normal birth). If something does go wrong, in the eyes of the courts \"a normal birth is a risk. The courts reward action,\" Block says.\nAlthough the United States has one the highest rates of Caesareans\u2014and of infant mortality\u2014Villar says the rest of the developed world is catching up. But opinion differs on how to respond. Doctors such as Stark say we need a better sense of what goes on while the baby is still in utero. \"One of the knowledge gaps is a clear understanding of the indications for C-sections,\" she says. (Known indications include breech position of the fetus, and pre-existing medical conditions such as extreme hypertension in the mother.) Naomi Wolf, author of \"Misconceptions: Truth, Lies, and the Unexpected on the Journey to Motherhood,\" blames insurance companies and hospitals, who she says deny women information about their choices. Wolf and other natural-birth advocates say we need a better idea of what normal birth looks like, as movies and TV usually depict the process as painful and bloody. \"We all have this idea that normal birth is a woman lying in a hospital bed screaming,\" says Block. If nothing else, \"The Business of Being Born,\" with its indelible image of a naked, exhilarated Ricki Lake cooing \"Hi there!\" to her seconds-old son in her bathtub, will give them another view.\nThere are many births in the documentary film \"The Business of Being Born,\" including a scene of former talk-show host Ricki Lake giving birth naked in her tub. But the image that viewers may find most shocking is that of a baby being cut out of a woman's abdomen via Caesarean. This, according to Lake, the executive producer of the film, and Abby Epstein, the film's director, is the right reaction: one of their messages is that C-sections should only be performed when needed to guarantee the well-being of the mother and infant, and should not be a first choice for healthy mothers. New research into the risks associated with elective Caesareans supports their view. In a study, published in October's British Medical Journal, of 97,000 deliveries in 410 Latin American hospitals, perinatal specialist Dr. Jose Villar found the risk of death for mothers who had Caesareans, while slight (.01 percent of the women who delivered vaginally died vs. .04 percent who had elective C-sections), was triple that of those who delivered vaginally. \"The C-section increases risk because it's major surgery,\" Villar says. Mothers who had undergone a Caesarean were also more likely to need blood transfusions and stay in the hospital more than a week after delivery. The risk of death for infants delivered via C-section\u2014who are more likely to have a low birth weight\u2014was double that of vaginal births, and C-section babies were more likely to have respiratory problems. According to a study published in the journal Birth, labor clears liquid from the infant's lungs, preparing the baby to breathe outside the womb. Caesareans impede this process. Yet the rate of Caesareans is spiking: in 2006, C-sections accounted for 31.1 percent of births nationwide, a 50 percent increase over the past 10 years. Natural birth\u2014without drugs or interventions\u2014whether at home or in a hospital, remains a rarity (despite the fact that home births don't have an appreciably higher risk rate than hospital births).\n", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story provides information on the risks of C-section versus vaginal birth in absolute terms.

It also found that the protective effect increases with age. The study is by Peter Rothwell, MD, PhD, FRCP, of John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, England, and colleagues, and has been published online by the journal the Lancet. A previous study by the same authors showed that low doses of aspirin (75-300 milligrams) reduced the number of cases of colorectal cancer by a quarter and deaths caused by the disease by more than a third. The latest study confirms the earlier results and concludes that similar effects can be shown for other types of cancers.\n\nThe study looked at eight trials examining the effects of a daily dose of aspirin on preventing heart attacks involving 25,570 patients, 674 of whom died from cancer. They showed a 21% reduction in the number of deaths caused by cancer among those who had taken aspirin, compared with people who had not. The investigation also showed that the benefits of taking aspirin increased over time. After five years, death rates were shown to fall by 34% for all cancers and by 54% for gastrointestinal cancers. Participants were also followed up after 20 years, by which point 1,634 of the original participants had died as a direct result of cancer. This 20-year follow-up established that the risk of cancer death remained 20% lower among those who had been allocated aspirin than those in the control group for all solid cancers, including lung, prostate, brain, bladder, and kidney cancers, and by 35% for gastrointestinal cancers. The fall in the risk of death broke down according to individual types of cancer: Reductions in pancreatic, stomach, and brain cancers were difficult to quantify because of smaller numbers of deaths, the authors say.\n\nThe protective effect of taking low doses of aspirin varied according to the type of cancer and how long aspirin had been taken, the authors found. For instance, it only became apparent after about five years for esophageal, pancreatic, brain, and lung cancer; about 10 years for stomach and colorectal cancer; and about 15 years for prostate cancer.

''Acupuncture could potentially become an alternative treatment to occlusion [patching] therapy for ambylopia [lazy eye], the researchers write. The study, conducted in China, is published in the Archives of Ophthalmology. U.S. experts familiar with the study call it interesting but say the treatment needs more study and wonder if it would catch on in the U.S.\n\nWhile some previous research has found acupuncture for lazy eye effective, the researchers couldn't find a study that directly compared acupuncture with conventional treatments such as patching. So Dennis Lam, MD, a researcher at the Joint Shantou International Eye Center of Shantou University and Chinese University of Hong Kong, and his colleagues evaluated 88 children, ages 7 to 12, with the condition known as anisometropic amblyopia, in which there is a difference in the degree of nearsightedness or farsightedness between the two eyes. They assigned 43 children to the acupuncture group, and they received five treatments a week. Acupuncturists used five different points in the head, face, hand, and leg. The children were instructed to do an hour per day of near-vision activities such as homework or computer work. Another 45 children wore a patch over their normal eye for two hours daily, a typical regimen, and were also asked to do an hour of near-vision activity a day.\n\nAt 15 weeks, visual acuity with eyeglasses improved by about 1.8 lines on the vision chart in the patched eyes and 2.3 lines in those who had acupuncture. An improvement of two lines or more occurred in nearly 67% of those in the patching group but nearly 76% of those in the acupuncture group. Ambylopia was evaluated as resolved in nearly 17% of patched eyes but nearly 42% of the acupuncture group. ''These results suggest that the treatment effect of acupuncture is equivalent to that of patching for anisometropic amblyopia in older children,\" Lam writes.

To say the vaccine lowered the infection rate to 6% is misleading because there was no comparison group.

Fenfluramine was taken off the market in 1997 after being linked to potentially life-threatening heart valve problems.

For instance, they provide a means to search for tumors in outer parts of the breast where mammography may not reach. About half of breast cancers develop in the upper-outer quadrant of the breast, which is largely inaccessible to mammography scanners. A small study in Canada in 1997 found that self-exams seemed to improve survival among a subset of women using proper technique. The preferred method, known as the vertical strip, three-pressure test, has proved the most sensitive and least likely to produce false alarms, Steiner said. In the largest and most influential study to date, involving 266,000 women in Shanghai, Steiner said researchers taught an inferior method of exams. She said that could partly explain why the Shanghai study failed to find improved survival. Self-exams also appeal strongly to some younger women, whose main screening test is a manual exam done by a doctor or nurse. Mammography is considered inappropriate for women younger than 40, and many doctors don't recommend it until age 50. If a woman decides to do self-exams, Steiner said, it's important to learn to do them right -- and do them every month without fail. \"Done haphazardly and irregularly, it is probably worse than no breast self-exam at all,\" Steiner said. She encourages women to schedule an appointment devoted to learning the technique, which should take at least a half-hour. A few minutes squeezed into a routine annual exam aren't enough, she said. Steiner said not all doctors are up to speed on breast exam technique, which calls for lying down, not taking a few minutes standing in the shower -- the form pushed for years by physicians and even anti-breast cancer groups. \"It's important to ask, 'Do you feel confident in your own technique and training me how to do it?'\" she said.

North American allergy experts tell WebMD that although they find the preliminary findings fascinating, further study is needed before they would recommend the herbs. Yoshiteru Shimoide, MD, head of the Yoshiteru Shimoide Clinic of Internal Medicine in Kagoshima City, Japan, presented the results here at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology (AAAAI).\n\nAsthma on the Rise in U.S. The number of people in the U.S. with asthma is growing. One in 12 people had asthma in 2009, compared with 1 in 14 in 2001, according to the CDC. There is no cure, but most people can control their symptoms, reduce the severity of their disease, and prevent asthma attacks by avoiding asthma triggers and correctly using prescribed medicines, such as steroid inhalers, the CDC says. There's much room for improvement, Shimoide says. He says it was accidentally discovered that kampo herbs could wipe out symptoms in many people while testing the ancient remedy against an allergic skin disorder known as atopic dermatitis. So his team studied 278 people with asthma who suffered daily symptoms of the disease. Of those, 52 were given standard treatment (typically an inhaled steroid and a bronchodilator), and 226 were treated with kampo herbs. Symptoms completely disappeared in 94% of patients taking kampo herbs after an average of 16 days, Shimoide says. In contrast, about three-fourths of those taking standard asthma medications still had daily wheeze and other symptoms.\n\nThe study did not look at possible side effects of kampo herbs.

As the disease worsens, blood vessels can swell and lose their ability to function properly. Diabetic retinopathy becomes proliferative when lack of blood flow in the retina increases production of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which can stimulate the growth of new, abnormal blood vessels. These new vessels are prone to bleeding into the center of the eye, sometimes requiring a surgical procedure called a vitrectomy to clear the blood. The abnormal blood vessels can also cause scarring and retinal detachment. Untreated, PDR is associated with high risk of visual loss.

Women with breast arterial calcification were more likely to be older, have high blood pressure and chronic kidney disease, and less likely smokers. Women with established cardiovascular diseases were excluded. Breast arterial calcification was evaluated on a scale from zero to 12 by increasing severity, and CAC was measured on the CT using a validated 0-12 severity score.

The average age of the veterans was 49 years and many were veterans of the Vietnam War. To be included, veterans had to have abstained from substance use for at least seven days. Of the veterans enrolled in the trial, 83% completed it, a very high rate for this difficult-to-treat population.\nVeterans in the study had low rates of substance use during the trial, and the study found little effect of medication on use, perhaps due to the fact that all participants were receiving SUD treatment and exhibiting low levels of use. This finding could also be due to the relatively limited number of participants or to the chronic nature of the participants' PTSD. \"This is a tough patient population with SUD to work with.\" said Kalivas. \"We have Vietnam vets that have had PTSD for 15 to 20 years. This is not an easy-to-turn-around population.\"\n", "question": "Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The intent of the pilot study was to determine the effect of N-acetylcysteine on PTSD symptoms, cravings and substance use.

Age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, is the leading cause of vision loss among seniors, gradually eroding crucial central vision. There are different forms but more than 5 million people worldwide, and a million in the U.S., have an advanced type of so-called \u201cdry\u201d macular degeneration that has no treatment. First patients may notice blurriness when they look straight ahead. Eventually many develop blank spots, becoming legally blind.\nIn an 18-month study of 129 patients, monthly eye injections of the drug modestly slowed worsening of the disease when compared with patients given dummy shots. What\u2019s exciting for scientists came next, when researchers from drugmaker Genentech Inc. took a closer look at exactly who was being helped. It turns out that nearly 6 in 10 of the study\u2019s participants carry a gene variation that makes part of the immune system go awry \u2014 a genetic flaw already known to increase the risk of getting macular degeneration in the first place. Those are the only patients who appeared to benefit from the drug; they had 44 per cent less eye damage than the untreated patients, the Genentech team reported Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine. While the study is too small to prove if lampalizumab really helps maintain vision, that\u2019s a bigger difference than the overall results suggested. Why would an immune-related gene affect aging eyes? One arm of the immune system, the complement pathway, helps fight infections by attracting immune cells to attack bacteria.\nThe hypothesis: Genentech\u2019s drug, lampalizumab, essentially offers a backup method for tamping down the immune reaction. An antibody, it works by inhibiting a particular enzyme named factor D that helps power the immune pathway. \u201cWe try to reinsert the braking ability,\u201d said study lead author Brian Yaspan, a Genentech senior scientist. Wednesday\u2019s study detected no safety concerns, clearing the way for Genentech and its parent company Roche to open two large-scale studies that aim to prove if the drug works. Results are expected later this year. The current research sheds light on how that long-suspected immune culprit might be working, and is \u201cthe first suggestion that there may be a treatment for geographic atrophy coming up in the future,\u201d said National Eye Institute retina specialist Dr. Wai Wong, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very exciting study,\u201d said Khurana, the ophthalmologist association\u2019s spokesman, who also wasn\u2019t part of the research. \u201cFrom the basic science perspective, it makes a lot of sense.\u201d Macular degeneration tends to occur after age 60, but it sometimes strikes earlier. According to the National Eye Institute, it\u2019s less common in people who exercise regularly, avoid smoking, and eat a diet high in green leafy vegetables and fish. Symptoms often aren\u2019t noticeable early on. But several eye tests can detect signs of macular degeneration, including a dilated eye exam and a tool called an Amsler grid with straight lines that may look wavy if the macula, the centre of the retina, is harmed. Macular degeneration patients often are advised to take certain vitamin combinations that may help stave off advanced disease. And it\u2019s important for patients to know what type they have. While there\u2019s no treatment for the advanced dry form, the \u201cwet\u201d form occurs when leaky blood vessels grow under the retina \u2014 and there are several therapies that can help those patients preserve vision.\n", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story tells us that patients who had the genetic variation and were treated with the drug had \u201c44 percent less eye damage than the untreated patients.\u201d However, since there is no information on what the baseline measurements were, we\u2019re not sure what that means.

(TSE:6501, \u201cHitachi\u201d) today announced that Johns Hopkins Medicine has selected Hitachi to provide its proton beam therapy (PBT) system at Sibley Memorial Hospital located in Washington, D.C. This collaboration, which includes a 10-year maintenance service, marks the first multi-room PBT application in the nation\u2019s capital. This will be Hitachi\u2019s fifth PBT system in North America.\nUnlike conventional scattering technology, spot scanning technology delivers narrow beams to the tumor and the complex tumor shape can be irradiated through repetitive beam delivery with quick position change. Spot scanning technology has been achieved by advancing the uniform quality beam extraction technology from the accelerator and beam control technology with high accuracy. Three primary benefits are: (1) more accurate irradiation which reduces the side effects to healthy tissues surrounding the tumor compared with irradiation from conventional double scattering irradiation; (2) patient-specific collimators and boluses become obsolete, shortening set up times for patients; and (3) high proton beam usage factor reducing unnecessary secondary radiation.\nGiven the growing demand for technical and clinical advancements in the treatment of cancer, interest in proton therapy is on the rise, with more and more hospitals and cancer treatment facilities venturing into this area. Hitachi will continue to globally expand the healthcare business where proton therapy is its flagship solution, and contribute to cancer treatment around the world.\n", "question": "Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "PBT\u2019s advantage over other types of radiation treatment is its ability to focus narrow beams of radiation onto tumors with reduced radiation spillover into other organs.

Unfortunately, the news release didn\u2019t specify which types of cancers are good targets for PBT. There\u2019s the implication that PBT should be used in a wider number of cancers. However, there\u2019s ongoing disagreement over the evidence that PBT has a significant advantage over other types of radiation treatments in prostate cancer, for which it is coming into wider use.\nThere are two reasons PBT is becoming a common treatment for prostate cancer. With protons, only two fields (or radiation passes) are needed to cover the prostate compared with 7 to 9 fields using photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in order to achieve an effective dose. The other reason is that clinics that have an expensive proton facility need to justify having it, and prostate cancer is very common.

Only hormone therapy, which many women can\u2019t take or want to avoid, is more effective for treating the most common symptom of menopause, says researcher Gary R.

The progression is familiar to most women of a certain age. Hot flashes and night sweats are the most common symptoms of menopause, affecting some 80% of women. They are linked to declining estrogen levels, but it remains unclear just why the sudden lack of estrogen sends the body into thermal mayhem, and why some women are more affected than others.

One study shows fluoride makes it more difficult for these bacteria to stick to the teeth.\nStriking as these results seem, the concept isn't new. This shift to a preventive model of dentistry is decades in the making. \"Some of the stuff in our study has been known for 50 years,\" Evans says, referring to the use of fluoride treatments.\n\"It really proved that drilling and filling did not fix the disease,\" Featherstone says. \"Putting in a filling fixes that hole in the tooth, but it doesn't deal with the bacteria in the rest of the mouth.\" Most bacteria are friendly, but a couple of bad actors can cause cavities.

The artificial nutrition is infused directly into the bloodstream.\nThe results are remarkable. \"We found that the current practice of feeding children in an early stage does not contribute to their recovery\", says lead author Professor Greet Van den Berghe from KU Leuven / University Hospitals Leuven. \"On the contrary, the children who had built up a nutritional deficiency after receiving little to no feedings had fewer infections, less organ failure, and a quicker recovery than children who had been fed through the IV.
