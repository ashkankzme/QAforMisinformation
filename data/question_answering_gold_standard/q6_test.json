Most came from people who got Botox to erase their wrinkles, but the 28 deaths occurred in people who had received it for medical purposes. The FDA didn't do much in response, but since then it has been getting new reports of serious adverse reactions in people receiving Botox, and launched a safety review. An analysis of the FDA's database by the advocacy group Public Citizen found 16 deaths from Botox or Myobloc. Most involved children with serious diseases like cerebral palsy, who got the injections for muscle spasms (an unapproved, though legal, use).

First, while the release mentions Eli Lilly\u2019s funding, it doesn\u2019t make clear Lilly\u2019s financial ties to cetuximab. Lilly manufactures cetuximab and receives royalties on Erbitux worldwide (though it is marketed by different companies, depending on where it is being sold). In short, Lilly has a vested interest in seeing an increase in cetuximab use (the drug reportedly brought in $723 million in 2014 \u2014 in North America alone). Second, many readers, possibly most readers, may not have access to the journal article. And if an institution knows that information is worth mentioning to readers (such as whether researchers had conflicts of interest), then an institution should not make readers put in extra legwork to find that information. And there is certainly relevant information to share here. The lead author reported working as a consultant for Lilly. Two co-authors are Lilly employees. A third co-author is a former Lilly employee and owns Lilly stock. And a fourth co-author works for Merck KGaA, which markets cetuximab outside of North America.

If caught early, though, there are medications and procedures that may help treat glaucoma. In the study, researchers were able to predict who was at increased risk of developing the eye disease with some accuracy by measuring blood vessel thickness in the retinas of study participants using a computer-based imaging tool.
