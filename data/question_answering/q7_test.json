The incidence of liver enzyme elevation was higher in patients treated with laquinimod, according to Comi, but he added that the elevations were temporary, reversible and did not lead to any signs of liver problems.\nThe study found that to date, the new drug appears to be both safe and well-tolerated. If the experimental medication is eventually approved for use, it would be only the second oral MS drug available to patients, alongside a number of long-standing injectable options.\nIn the two-year, double-blind Phase III trial, participants were randomly divided into two groups: those who were given a daily dose of laquinimod (0.6 milligrams) and those who were given a sugar-pill (placebo); neither the researchers nor the participants knew who received the medication or the placebo.\n", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story includes an unchallenged comment that \u201coral drugs are much better than shots,\u201d without explaining why or what sort of evidence supports this claim. It redeems itself, though, by explaining that the inability to draw clear comparisons between the experimental drug and current alternatives is one of the study\u2019s short points. \u201cLaquinimod was not, however, tested against currently existing treatment alternatives, the authors stressed,\u201d the story says. \u201cThe team added that the new medication appears to tackle MS by a different type of mechanism than other available options, and apparently works by curtailing the onset of permanent tissue damage while limiting acute inflammation. Then Dr. Gary Birnbaum, director of the MS Treatment and Research Center at the Minneapolis Clinic of Neurology,\u00a0provides\u00a0readers with a good summation of why this new drug, while not necessarily\u00a0a silver bullet, could be\u00a0clinically beneficial.\u00a0\u201cAnd MS is probably not a single disease,\u201d Birnbaum says. \u201cSo different medications may work better for some and not others, which is why this new drug could end up being an important addition to the armamentarium.\u201d He adds, though, \u201cHowever, we still need to have a head-to-head comparison with other drugs.\u201d", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The findings were published online March 7 in Acupuncture in Medicine.\nThough the researchers acknowledged that they did not monitor how long symptom relief lasted, they suggested that traditional acupuncture may offer an alternative for women who can't or don't want to use hormone replacement therapy to ease menopause symptoms.\nThe research included 53 postmenopausal women, with about half receiving traditional Chinese acupuncture twice a week and the others given sham acupuncture treatments.\n", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "Not a word about any other research on acupuncture for menopausal symptoms and no comparison with any other methods used to relieve symptoms.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "A colonoscopy isn\u2019t something you get just for giggles.

There have been 756 PML cases reported worldwide as of January 2018, with a global incidence rate of 4.19 per 1,000 PML cases in people treated with natalizumab. Patients who test JCV antibody-positive are typically either told to not to start natalizumab, or have had treatment stopped after two years, when risk was deemed to be too high.\nThe new study, however, reports safety data through up to 72 months, or 6 years, when the extended dosing regimens were applied, with risk reduction for PML as high as 94 percent.\nResearchers reviewed data on all patients who have been exposed to JCV who are enrolled in TOUCH, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-mandated Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program for natalizumab that requires manufacturers to document all uses of a medication to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. Since the optimal extended dose schedule is not known, researchers chose to look at the data in multiple ways, with the primary definition looking at extended dose history in the last 18 months, the secondary definition looking at extended dose occurring at any time in the dosing history, and for tertiary definition looking primarily at how extended dose history affects PML risk. The results showed clinically and statistically significant risk reductions with all definitions.\n", "question": "Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "There is no cure for multiple sclerosis.
