But defining medical necessity is complicated. Natural-birth advocates cite a \"cascade of interventions\" caused by hospitals' practice of using the drug Pitocin to stimulate labor. The drug can cause painful contractions, which doctors treat with an epidural painkiller. The epidural can then retard contractions and lead to more drugs, fetal stress and the doctor's recommendation of a Caesarean. Natural-birth advocates say that hospitals, driven by profits and worried about malpractice, are too quick to intervene. \"I compare it to a restaurant. If you have customers who sit at a table and don't order anything, you're not making any money,\" says Jennifer Block, author of \"Pushed: The Painful Truth About Childbirth and Modern Maternity Care.\" Normal labor, Block says, isn't profitable (according to \"The Business of Being Born,\" a Caesarean can cost three times as much as a normal birth). If something does go wrong, in the eyes of the courts \"a normal birth is a risk. The courts reward action,\" Block says.\nAlthough the United States has one the highest rates of Caesareans\u2014and of infant mortality\u2014Villar says the rest of the developed world is catching up. But opinion differs on how to respond. Doctors such as Stark say we need a better sense of what goes on while the baby is still in utero. \"One of the knowledge gaps is a clear understanding of the indications for C-sections,\" she says. (Known indications include breech position of the fetus, and pre-existing medical conditions such as extreme hypertension in the mother.) Naomi Wolf, author of \"Misconceptions: Truth, Lies, and the Unexpected on the Journey to Motherhood,\" blames insurance companies and hospitals, who she says deny women information about their choices. Wolf and other natural-birth advocates say we need a better idea of what normal birth looks like, as movies and TV usually depict the process as painful and bloody. \"We all have this idea that normal birth is a woman lying in a hospital bed screaming,\" says Block. If nothing else, \"The Business of Being Born,\" with its indelible image of a naked, exhilarated Ricki Lake cooing \"Hi there!\" to her seconds-old son in her bathtub, will give them another view.\nThere are many births in the documentary film \"The Business of Being Born,\" including a scene of former talk-show host Ricki Lake giving birth naked in her tub. But the image that viewers may find most shocking is that of a baby being cut out of a woman's abdomen via Caesarean. This, according to Lake, the executive producer of the film, and Abby Epstein, the film's director, is the right reaction: one of their messages is that C-sections should only be performed when needed to guarantee the well-being of the mother and infant, and should not be a first choice for healthy mothers. New research into the risks associated with elective Caesareans supports their view. In a study, published in October's British Medical Journal, of 97,000 deliveries in 410 Latin American hospitals, perinatal specialist Dr. Jose Villar found the risk of death for mothers who had Caesareans, while slight (.01 percent of the women who delivered vaginally died vs. .04 percent who had elective C-sections), was triple that of those who delivered vaginally. \"The C-section increases risk because it's major surgery,\" Villar says. Mothers who had undergone a Caesarean were also more likely to need blood transfusions and stay in the hospital more than a week after delivery. The risk of death for infants delivered via C-section\u2014who are more likely to have a low birth weight\u2014was double that of vaginal births, and C-section babies were more likely to have respiratory problems. According to a study published in the journal Birth, labor clears liquid from the infant's lungs, preparing the baby to breathe outside the womb. Caesareans impede this process. Yet the rate of Caesareans is spiking: in 2006, C-sections accounted for 31.1 percent of births nationwide, a 50 percent increase over the past 10 years. Natural birth\u2014without drugs or interventions\u2014whether at home or in a hospital, remains a rarity (despite the fact that home births don't have an appreciably higher risk rate than hospital births).\n", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story quantifies the risk of death in C-section versus vaginal birth.

North American allergy experts tell WebMD that although they find the preliminary findings fascinating, further study is needed before they would recommend the herbs. Yoshiteru Shimoide, MD, head of the Yoshiteru Shimoide Clinic of Internal Medicine in Kagoshima City, Japan, presented the results here at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology (AAAAI).\n\nAsthma on the Rise in U.S. The number of people in the U.S. with asthma is growing.

There is no cure, but most people can control their symptoms, reduce the severity of their disease, and prevent asthma attacks by avoiding asthma triggers and correctly using prescribed medicines, such as steroid inhalers, the CDC says. There's much room for improvement, Shimoide says. He says it was accidentally discovered that kampo herbs could wipe out symptoms in many people while testing the ancient remedy against an allergic skin disorder known as atopic dermatitis. So his team studied 278 people with asthma who suffered daily symptoms of the disease. Of those, 52 were given standard treatment (typically an inhaled steroid and a bronchodilator), and 226 were treated with kampo herbs. Symptoms completely disappeared in 94% of patients taking kampo herbs after an average of 16 days, Shimoide says. In contrast, about three-fourths of those taking standard asthma medications still had daily wheeze and other symptoms.\n\nThe study did not look at possible side effects of kampo herbs. But a major problem facing kampo medicine is herbal product quality. There have been cases in which poisonous plants found their way into the herbal mix, resulting in kidney damage, for example.

The study, funded by Merz Pharmaceuticals, which makes the cream, was presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology.

They form when the skin is rapidly stretched, such as during puberty, pregnancy, and rapid weight gain, says Joshua Zeichner, MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research at Mt.

Fenfluramine was taken off the market in 1997 after being linked to potentially life-threatening heart valve problems.

Results from a pivotal study of the treatment were reported today in the American Heart Association (AHA) journal Circulation Research. Patients with untreatable angina who received the injections of CD34+ stem cells in key areas of the heart had significantly fewer chest pain episodes and significantly better performance on exercise tests than patients who got placebo injections.\n\nDrugs, angioplasty, and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery are the main treatments for angina -- chest pain caused by blocked coronary arteries. About 850,000 Americans have angina that persists despite available treatments. \"These are patients who have been on drugs and may have had multiple angioplasties or CABG surgeries,\" AHA President Gordon Tomaselli, MD, tells WebMD. \"Their activities are severely restricted by their chest pain and right now we have little to offer them.\" The new treatment came from the discovery about a decade ago that CD34+ stem cells stimulate the formation of new blood vessels, study researcher Douglas W. Losordo, MD, of Chicago's Northwestern University tells WebMD. \"Coronary artery disease involves not only the blockage of major arteries, but the death of small vessels, or capillaries, of the heart muscle,\" he says. \"This treatment targets these small vessels that have been damaged. The stem cells have shown the ability to repair and replace them in animal models.\" The approach also showed promise in a 2007 pilot study involving fewer than 30 patients. The newly reported study included 167 patients with severe angina treated at 26 medical centers across the country.\n\nStudy participants received one of three treatments: low-dose CD34+ injections, high-dose injections, or placebo. Patients were given a drug for several days to increase the number of CD34+ stem cells in the blood. Blood was collected and processed to collect the stem cells, and then, using a catheter threaded into the heart, the researchers injected the CD34+ cells into areas of the muscle that had been identified as oxygen-deprived areas.

For instance, they provide a means to search for tumors in outer parts of the breast where mammography may not reach. About half of breast cancers develop in the upper-outer quadrant of the breast, which is largely inaccessible to mammography scanners. A small study in Canada in 1997 found that self-exams seemed to improve survival among a subset of women using proper technique. The preferred method, known as the vertical strip, three-pressure test, has proved the most sensitive and least likely to produce false alarms, Steiner said. In the largest and most influential study to date, involving 266,000 women in Shanghai, Steiner said researchers taught an inferior method of exams. She said that could partly explain why the Shanghai study failed to find improved survival. Self-exams also appeal strongly to some younger women, whose main screening test is a manual exam done by a doctor or nurse. Mammography is considered inappropriate for women younger than 40, and many doctors don't recommend it until age 50. If a woman decides to do self-exams, Steiner said, it's important to learn to do them right -- and do them every month without fail. \"Done haphazardly and irregularly, it is probably worse than no breast self-exam at all,\" Steiner said. She encourages women to schedule an appointment devoted to learning the technique, which should take at least a half-hour. A few minutes squeezed into a routine annual exam aren't enough, she said. Steiner said not all doctors are up to speed on breast exam technique, which calls for lying down, not taking a few minutes standing in the shower -- the form pushed for years by physicians and even anti-breast cancer groups. \"It's important to ask, 'Do you feel confident in your own technique and training me how to do it?'\" she said.

However, radiation therapy and surgery have a negative impact on quality of life.

Three trials had used zinc acetate lozenges and found that colds were shortened on average by 40%. Four trials had used zinc gluconate lozenges and colds were shortened on average by 28%. The 12% difference between the average effects of the two kinds of lozenges was explained purely by random variation. Furthermore, one of the zinc gluconate lozenge trials was an outlier inconsistent with all the other six zinc lozenge trials. If that outlier trial was excluded, the difference between the three zinc acetate and the three zinc gluconate trials shrinked to just 2%, i.e., a 40% vs. 38% reduction in common cold duration. Thus, properly composed zinc gluconate lozenges may be as effective as zinc acetate lozenges.\nAccording to Dr. Hemil\u00e4, there is no justification for the popular phrase that \"there is no cure for the common cold\" because of the strong evidence that zinc lozenges can shorten common cold duration by over 30%. However, in future studies the optimal composition of zinc lozenges should be investigated. The optimum frequency of their administration also warrants further investigation. Nevertheless, he also considers that \"the current evidence of efficacy for zinc lozenges is so strong that common cold patients should be encouraged to try them for treating their colds, but the patients should ascertain that the lozenges do not contain citric acid or its salt citrate.\"\nDr. Hemil\u00e4 also analyzed the dose response relationship between the elemental zinc dose and the observed efficacy in reducing common cold duration.

At the time, Colorado was one of only about a dozen states in the U.S. that had legalized medical cannabis. It also allowed sick children to access the drug under professional guidance. Landon became the youngest patient in the U.S. at that time to receive a medical marijuana card. Riddle\u2019s decision to treat her child with cannabis landed the family in the center of a contentious national debate, as well as on prime-time television with CNN\u2019s chief medical correspondent, Sanjay Gupta. In Utah, all cannabis is illegal, so when their story went public, she and Landon had to move permanently to Colorado, so he could continue to have access to the drug. Even now, at 7, he still needs to take cannabis to cope with the long-term effects of chemotherapy and radiation, she says.\nWhen Riddle made the decision to give her son cannabis, the information on its safety and efficacy was (and still is) limited to anecdotal accounts, a handful of case reports and lab studies published in obscure medical journals. Initially, her hope was that the drug would lessen the side effects. But Riddle soon heard that certain compounds in cannabis\u2014cannabinoids\u2014have been shown to induce cancer cell death. The theory seemed to be especially promising for leukemia, at least according to studies done on cancer cells in test tubes and on mice injected with human leukemia cells. But at that point there wasn\u2019t any evidence it would work for humans. There still isn\u2019t. While cannabis is legal in many U.S. states, the drug is still classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a Schedule 1 narcotic (along with heroin and cocaine), which make it very difficult for scientists to conduct clinical trials on people. However, that may change as other nations, such as Israel, take the lead and fund marijuana research.\nThe findings so far from published lab studies suggest cannabidiol (CBD), one of more than 100 cannabinoids present in the plant, targets certain pathways in leukemia. The evidence indicates that leukemia cells have a high number of cannabinoid receptors\u2014primarily the receptor CB2.

The progression is familiar to most women of a certain age. Hot flashes and night sweats are the most common symptoms of menopause, affecting some 80% of women. They are linked to declining estrogen levels, but it remains unclear just why the sudden lack of estrogen sends the body into thermal mayhem, and why some women are more affected than others.

Now there's growing evidence that the same is true for your brain. A new study by researchers at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago shows a diet plan they developed -- appropriately called the MIND diet -- may reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease by as much as 53 percent. Even those who didn't stick to the diet perfectly but followed it \"moderately well\" reduced their risk of Alzheimer's by about a third. Diet appears to be just one of \"many factors that play into who gets the disease,\" said nutritional epidemiologist Martha Clare Morris, PhD, the lead author of the MIND diet study. Genetics and other factors like smoking, exercise and education also play a role. But the MIND diet helped slow the rate of cognitive decline and protect against Alzheimer's regardless of other risk factors. The study, published in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia, looked at more than 900 people between the ages of 58 and 98 who filled out food questionnaires and underwent repeated neurological testing. It found participants whose diets most closely followed the MIND recommendations had a level of cognitive function the equivalent of a person 7.5 years younger. The MIND diet breaks its recommendations down into 10 \"brain healthy food groups\" a person should eat and five \"unhealthy food groups\" to avoid. It combines many elements of two other popular nutrition plans which have been proven to benefit heart health: the Mediterranean diet and the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet. (MIND stands for Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay.) But the MIND diet also differs from those plans in a few significant ways and proved more effective than either of them at reducing the risk of Alzheimer's. Click through to see which foods to eat -- and which ones to avoid -- for optimal brain health.\nThe MIND diet recommends frequent servings of green leafy vegetables. Kale, spinach, broccoli, collards and other greens are packed with vitamins A and C and other nutrients. At least two servings a week can help, and researchers found six or more servings a week provide the greatest brain benefits. The Mediterranean and DASH diets do not specifically recommend these types of vegetables, but the MIND diet study found that including greens in addition to other veggies made a difference in reducing the risk of Alzheimer's.\nBerries are the only fruit specifically recommended in the MIND diet. \"Blueberries are one of the more potent foods in terms of protecting the brain,\" Morris said.

The study also mentions bowel obstruction and pelvic abscesses. About 7 percent of patients whose surgery was delayed were hospitalized for radiation toxicity.\nThe news release (and the abstract of the journal article) avoid a thornier question.

The absolute difference in local cancer recurrence is only 0.6% (with a large margin of possible error) whereas surgical complications were reduced by an absolute 12% (41 vs. 53%).\nThe study notes that one potential drawback of delaying surgery is that it delays the start of chemotherapy in\u00a0 regimens that include chemotherapy after a tumor has been removed.

The distinction seems that clear. \u201cIf you can tell the difference as a non-radiologist, imagine how a radiologist feels,\u201d says Rafferty. \u201cThe images sort of sell themselves.\u201d\nBut the company, and the rest of us, should be careful not to overhype 3-D mammography. As Rafferty says, it\u2019s not a panacea. The technology does come with costs, financial and medical. A fully equipped 3-D machine runs on average $474,541, not including the annual service fee Hologic charges for maintenance, and even hospitals that already own an upgradeable 2-D system made by Hologic have to pay about $125,000 to get it adapted for 3-D use. There are also costs in the sense of risks: Women who get a combo 2-D and 3-D mammogram, the protocol that confers the most dramatic jump in benefits, are exposed to twice as much X-ray radiation as the norm (albeit still an amount that\u2019s under the FDA\u2019s permitted limit). And no one yet knows if the new technique will actually save lives.\nMuch of the criticism focused on the data the task force had used to make its decision, which consisted largely of the results from prospective, randomized clinical trials conducted in the United States. Trials like this are the gold standard of medical evidence. They are also expensive and time-consuming, and thus hard to come by. The most recent such trial looking at mammography and mortality in the United States was published in the 1980s. \u201cA lot of the people on the task force are my friends, and I have tremendous respect for them, but this was a big point where we differed,\u201d says Brawley. \u201cThe standard type of mammography that\u2019s used all over the country today may very well be better than what was used in that trial. So the outcomes may be better, too.\u201d The studies the task force had chosen to examine showed that screening beginning at age 40 had little impact on mortality while at the same time generating a significant number of false positives. Those data were complete and comprehensive. But, says Brawley, they were outdated.\n", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The author does mention that a woman who has both 2-D and 3-D imaging, the protocol with the most benefit, would receive twice the radiation of 2-D imaging alone.\u00a0 While this is still under the FDA\u2019s permitted limit, the piece should also mention that patients need to consider\u00a0total radiation exposure from increased use of all high-tech diagnostic imaging equipment.\nIn addition to providing no evidence of improved sensitivity and specificity of 3-D imaging, the piece doesn\u2019t even mention the possibility of over-diagnosis and over-treatment of very early stage breast cancers that may never have needed treatment.\u00a0 Thus a woman may be harmed physically, emotionally\u00a0and financially because of over-treatment.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "CHICAGO\u2014Using whole-brain radiation to treat cancer that has spread to the brain is a treatment that for many patients is worse than the disease, a new study suggests.\n\nResearchers said the technique, when used after a more precise radiotherapy to kill the cancer, resulted in more memory loss and other cognitive deficits than treating with radiotherapy alone.

The release notes that some people are unable to tolerate the side effect of citrate and it says that safety studies of hydroxycitrate are needed, but there is no discussion of what potential harms the proposed treatment might pose.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "\"Now we know what we need,\" she said. \"More bigger studies on more things.\"\nThe researchers found that on average, antidepressants and Catapres each appeared to reduce hot flashes by about one per day, and Neurontin by about two per day. For women with a lot of hot flashes, that is not a very impressive performance, Dr. Nelson said, but she added that the drugs may also lessen their severity.\nAmong the antidepressants, Paxil seemed to have the strongest evidence of benefit. There were only two studies for Effexor, just one of which suggested it might help.\n", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Mentions side effects of the non-hormonal treatment under study, as well as the risks associated with hormone replacement therapy. There is no mention of the incidence of these side effects. However, this was a meta-analysis of 43 studies, so side effects varied by medication and each study.

The sweet spot on the BMI/longevity axis is typically somewhere near the middle. But there's not much data to back the notion that a bit more pudge is protective. \"This is total speculation,\" Nordestgaard says.\nThe BMI has been vilified as a poor measure of an individual's health. Someone who is big, fit and well-muscled, like a pro football player, can peg an obese BMI. And all of the people in this study are white, so that's a limitation. But the BMI, which is a general measure of body fat, has proven useful for thinking about the health of large groups of people, as in this study.\n", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story did a good job describing why some people with low BMI might be at higher risk of dying\u2013 i.e., they may be suffering from cancer or another disease that could cause weight loss.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Another risk is that the surgery may be done unnecessarily. CT scans cannot pick up many of the small tumors, so it is often unclear how much cancer is inside until the patient is opened.\nThe cost of the surgery and Hipec, including hospitalization, ranges from $20,000 to more than $100,000, doctors said. While and insurers generally pay for the operation, the heated treatment may not be covered. But doctors added it may be if it is described merely as chemotherapy. Some patients, like Ms. Borges, who is a fitness devotee, recover well and say the procedure staved off a death sentence.\nA new trial in the has been temporarily suspended so that researchers can find a way to recruit patients. After nearly a year only one patient had enrolled, because people were reluctant to chance winding up in the control group, according to one of the investigators.\n", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story explains that one study showed that \u201c8 percent who got the surgery and Hipec died from the treatment itself.\u201d\u00a0 And it stated:", "answer": 1}, {"article": "CHICAGO \u2014 A migraine pill seems to help alcoholics taper off their drinking without detox treatment, researchers report, offering a potential option for a hard-to-treat problem.\nAddiction specialists not involved in the study said the findings are promising, although side effects such as trouble concentrating, tingling and itching caused about one in five people to drop out of the study. Drowsiness and dizziness are also problems.\nThe study followed 371 heavy drinkers for 14 weeks. About half were randomly assigned to take Topamax, also called topiramate, in gradually increasing doses. The others took dummy pills.\n", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story did mention some of the unpleasant side effects that people taking the drug experienced; although it did not provide information about how frequently they occurred, it mentioned that 20% of the people dropped out of the study which provides a composite of sorts.\u00a0 ", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Finasteride blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, a hormone active mostly in the prostate and the scalp, and that all prostate cancers need to grow.\nThe researchers had a way to learn if they were correct. Most of the men in the study who had cancer \u2014 aggressive or not \u2014 chose to be treated and many had their prostates removed. A pathologist could carefully examine every one of those 500 prostates and compare the kinds of cancers found at surgery to those initially diagnosed at biopsy.\nYet despite that note of triumph, a troubling finding emerged. The study was designed to look for a reduction in the overall prostate cancer rate. And that is what it found. But, as Dr. Scardino pointed out in an editorial five years ago in The New England Journal of Medicine that accompanied the study, it appeared that 6.4 percent of the men who took the drug got fast growing, ominous-looking tumors. In contrast, such tumors were found in 5.1 percent, of men who took the placebo.\n", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story did raise an important question about harms:\u00a0 \"Should healthy men take a drug for the rest of their lives to avoid getting and being treated for a cancer that, most often, would be better off undiscovered and untreated?Is it worth risking a chance that unanticipated side effects may emerge years later if millions of men with no prostate problems take this drug\u2026\"\u00a0 Although the balance of the story was out of whack \u2013 citing more proponents of using the drug than opponents \u2013 we\u2019ll give the story the benefit of the doubt on this criterion.

They can be carried out with a smaller incision using minimally invasive surgery, but they are only suitable for people whose ligaments inside the knee are strong.\nMany more people facing surgery for knee problems would be better off with a partial rather than total knee replacement, which should allow them to recover faster, say experts.\nPartial replacements are also cheaper, say researchers from Oxford University. The NHS, however, needs to get the support of surgeons, many of whom rarely carry out the less invasive procedure.\n", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "What risks are associated with getting either surgery? The story simply doesn\u2019t tell us.\nWhen considering harms, one needs to keep in mind the side effects of surgery, the recovery from surgery, how they function after recovery and then whether there are differences in the need for subsequent procedures.", "answer": 0}]
