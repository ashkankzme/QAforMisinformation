For example, if the drug resulted in a fatal complication in 2 out of 100 children, this small study could easily have missed that. It\u2019s risky to call a drug \u201csafe\u201d until it\u2019s been used in a very large number of patients.\nThis is particularly true when drugs are fast-tracked for approval by the FDA, as Harvoni\u2019s use in children is expected to be.
