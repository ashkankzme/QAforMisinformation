For instance, they provide a means to search for tumors in outer parts of the breast where mammography may not reach. About half of breast cancers develop in the upper-outer quadrant of the breast, which is largely inaccessible to mammography scanners. A small study in Canada in 1997 found that self-exams seemed to improve survival among a subset of women using proper technique. The preferred method, known as the vertical strip, three-pressure test, has proved the most sensitive and least likely to produce false alarms, Steiner said. In the largest and most influential study to date, involving 266,000 women in Shanghai, Steiner said researchers taught an inferior method of exams. She said that could partly explain why the Shanghai study failed to find improved survival. Self-exams also appeal strongly to some younger women, whose main screening test is a manual exam done by a doctor or nurse. Mammography is considered inappropriate for women younger than 40, and many doctors don't recommend it until age 50. If a woman decides to do self-exams, Steiner said, it's important to learn to do them right -- and do them every month without fail. \"Done haphazardly and irregularly, it is probably worse than no breast self-exam at all,\" Steiner said. She encourages women to schedule an appointment devoted to learning the technique, which should take at least a half-hour. A few minutes squeezed into a routine annual exam aren't enough, she said. Steiner said not all doctors are up to speed on breast exam technique, which calls for lying down, not taking a few minutes standing in the shower -- the form pushed for years by physicians and even anti-breast cancer groups. \"It's important to ask, 'Do you feel confident in your own technique and training me how to do it?'\" she said. Nelson cautions women not to skip their mammograms if they don't find lumps during self-exams. But finding a lump also is no reason to panic, given the limited accuracy of the self-test. Litt, the breast cancer survivor, has another piece of advice: \"Do not ignore your own judgment; and be assertive,\" she said. \"You don't get a do-over.\"\nEven though her mammogram showed no sign of cancer, Sandra Litt knew she could feel a lump. She had a second mammogram. Nothing there, the radiologist assured her. \"Then one night, I found the 'nothing there' had grown bigger,\" Litt said. Her self-exam had proved accurate. Two years ago, Litt underwent a double mastectomy and months of chemotherapy to survive an aggressive breast cancer. It defies common sense, she says, for scientists to conclude that breast self-exams do women more harm than good. \"It's a very important tool,\" the 67-year-old Portland woman says. \"Why throw away an important tool?\" A scientific review, published in August by the\n, highlighted the downside of doing breast self-exams: Women taught to perform the monthly ritual wind up having unnecessary biopsies. They are about twice as likely to undergo biopsies that won't find cancerous tumors, according to two studies tracking hundreds of thousands of women in China and Russia.

First, Kyleena is described as an intrauterine system that releases levonorgestrel in order to prevent pregnancy, and it is described preventing pregnancy for up to five years. Another product from Bayer, Mirena, is an intrauterine device that releases levonorgestrel in order to prevent pregnancy. It also is described as preventing pregnancy for up to five years. When a company is releasing a new product that, to the non-expert audience, looks an awful lot like an existing product, the company needs to clearly describe how the products are different \u2014 in terms of mechanism, benefit, cost and risk. Other levonorgestrel-releasing devices/implants include Liletta and Skyla. How does Kyleena differ from them? Second, and more broadly, the efficacy of Kyleena at preventing unwanted pregnancy is not compared to the broader suite of birth control options available. All in all, this is a significant oversight. Potential users of Kyleena should be able to clearly compare the costs, risks and benefits of the new product to existing products. And if the product is as advantageous as the manufacturer wants the market to believe, an up-front comparison would actually help convince consumers.\nThere are two classes of levonorgestrel IUDs currently on the market that vary in the amount of active hormone they contain: 1) 52 mg IUDs (Mirena and Liletta) and 2) a 13.5 mg IUD (Skyla). There are two important differences between them. First, the\u00a0higher dose IUDs\u00a0are effective for five years, whereas the lower dose Skyla is effective for three years. Second, there are differences in side effects, which for some women may make one preferable to the other. Mirena and Liletta can reduce the frequency and amount of bleeding, as well as menstrual cramping; Skyla has little effect on these factors.\u00a0 With a lower dose of levonorgestrel\u00a0 IUD (19.5 mg) compared to the other 5-year IUDs, Kyleena would seem to be Bayer\u2019s effort to create a lower dose IUD that\u00a0is effective for 5 years.\u00a0 In this context, it would be especially helpful to know how its \u201cside effects\u201d (whether beneficial or not)\u00a0compare to those of the other IUDs.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "The Annals of Thoracic Surgery is the official journal of STS and the Southern Thoracic Surgical Association.

Scientists have learned how to manipulate this mechanism so that it essentially can be programmed to find and remove a specific sequence of DNA code--which acts like software for controlling biological activity in a cell. Cas9 is a reference to an enzyme, sometimes described as a form of \"molecular scissors,\" that is used by CRISPR to cut out a section of DNA code.\n\"We think it's best to start with CRISPR therapies that involve relatively conservative uses of this powerful tool,\" Dr. Kmiec said. \"This approach can also hopefully help contain costs and provide a level of safety and reliability that is reassuring for patients and increases the chance that insurance companies will provide coverage.\"\nDr. Kmiec noted that while his team is working to move into human trials, the CRISPR application being developed for lung cancer does not involve directly editing a patient's genome --only the genes in the tumor.\n", "question": "Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The news release mentions \u201cmany efforts under way to modify CRISPR so that it can be used to not only remove or \u2018knock out\u2019 a section DNA, but also to replace or \u2018knock in\u2019 a new strand of code.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that there have been theories about \u201cre-sensitizing\u201d tumors to treatment that have not been successful, usually having to do with the sequence of drugs given after the first line.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "However, only the mice that consumed black tea extract had an increase in a type of bacteria called Pseudobutyrivibrio, which could help explain the difference between how black tea and green tea change energy metabolism.\n\"The results suggest that both green and black teas are prebiotics, substances that induce the growth of good microorganisms that contribute to a person's well-being,\" she said.\n\"It was known that green tea polyphenols are more effective and offer more health benefits than black tea polyphenols since green tea chemicals are absorbed into the blood and tissue,\" said Susanne Henning, the study's lead author and an adjunct professor at the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition, which is part of the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. \"Our new findings suggest that black tea, through a specific mechanism through the gut microbiome, may also contribute to good health and weight loss in humans.\"\n", "question": "Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The study was, in a sense, a comparison of alternatives but there were no mentions of any alternatives to reduce weight in mice, other than the two teas in question.\nWe think the release could have talked briefly about calorie balance as the most accepted way to avoid weight gain, and calorie restriction to encourage weight loss.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Researchers retract study claiming marriages fail more often when wife falls ill\nIn a study published in The Lancet on Thursday, researchers found that a class of inexpensive, existing generic called aromatase inhibitors, which suppress hormones, reduce recurrence rates by 30 percent as compared with tamoxifen.
