The experimental drug, lampalizumab, aims to slow the destruction of light-sensing cells in the retina, creeping lesions that characterize the stage of dry AMD called \u201cgeographic atrophy.\u201d When those cells die, they can\u2019t grow back \u2014 the vision loss is irreversible.\nThe hypothesis: Genentech\u2019s drug, lampalizumab, essentially offers a backup method for tamping down the immune reaction. An antibody, it works by inhibiting a particular enzyme named factor D that helps power the immune pathway. \u201cWe try to reinsert the braking ability,\u201d said study lead author Brian Yaspan, a Genentech senior scientist. Wednesday\u2019s study detected no safety concerns, clearing the way for Genentech and its parent company Roche to open two large-scale studies that aim to prove if the drug works. Results are expected later this year. The current research sheds light on how that long-suspected immune culprit might be working, and is \u201cthe first suggestion that there may be a treatment for geographic atrophy coming up in the future,\u201d said National Eye Institute retina specialist Dr. Wai Wong, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very exciting study,\u201d said Khurana, the ophthalmologist association\u2019s spokesman, who also wasn\u2019t part of the research. \u201cFrom the basic science perspective, it makes a lot of sense.\u201d Macular degeneration tends to occur after age 60, but it sometimes strikes earlier. According to the National Eye Institute, it\u2019s less common in people who exercise regularly, avoid smoking, and eat a diet high in green leafy vegetables and fish. Symptoms often aren\u2019t noticeable early on. But several eye tests can detect signs of macular degeneration, including a dilated eye exam and a tool called an Amsler grid with straight lines that may look wavy if the macula, the centre of the retina, is harmed. Macular degeneration patients often are advised to take certain vitamin combinations that may help stave off advanced disease. And it\u2019s important for patients to know what type they have. While there\u2019s no treatment for the advanced dry form, the \u201cwet\u201d form occurs when leaky blood vessels grow under the retina \u2014 and there are several therapies that can help those patients preserve vision.\n", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Although there are independent sources in the story, we\u2019re not told that one of them\u2013Dr. Rahul N.

In more recent years it has been brought back to the market to treat a number of serious conditions, but its use is monitored closely to ensure that it is not taken by women who are pregnant or who might become pregnant. Dermatology professor Andrew G. Franks Jr., MD, of the NYU Langone Medical Center, says thalidomide is very effective for treating people with lupus skin conditions who do not respond to standard treatments such as steroids and antimalarial drugs. He says about 75% of patients with affected skin will go into remission with these standard treatments. \u201cThe question has been, \u2018What do you do with the rest?\u2019\u201d he says. Franks says thalidomide can help an additional 75% of patients achieve remission. But side effects are common and some, including nerve damage in the hands and feet, can be permanent.\n\nThe lenalidomide study included 15 women with lupus skin conditions; six had lupus in other areas of the body, too. They all were followed for seven to 30 months. All had received standard treatments, and 14 had been treated with thalidomide previously. The majority of the patients (60%) had the most common subtype of lupus-related skin disease, known as discoid lupus erythematosus, which is characterized by red, scaly patches that can scar. One patient withdrew from the study after one week due to digestive system side effects. All the other patients showed improvement, and the rash cleared up in 86%. The researchers note that the study dose was \u201cgenerally well-tolerated.\u201d No new nerve symptoms were reported.

Another 45 children wore a patch over their normal eye for two hours daily, a typical regimen, and were also asked to do an hour of near-vision activity a day.\n\nAt 15 weeks, visual acuity with eyeglasses improved by about 1.8 lines on the vision chart in the patched eyes and 2.3 lines in those who had acupuncture.

North American allergy experts tell WebMD that although they find the preliminary findings fascinating, further study is needed before they would recommend the herbs. Yoshiteru Shimoide, MD, head of the Yoshiteru Shimoide Clinic of Internal Medicine in Kagoshima City, Japan, presented the results here at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology (AAAAI).\n\nAsthma on the Rise in U.S. The number of people in the U.S. with asthma is growing. One in 12 people had asthma in 2009, compared with 1 in 14 in 2001, according to the CDC. There is no cure, but most people can control their symptoms, reduce the severity of their disease, and prevent asthma attacks by avoiding asthma triggers and correctly using prescribed medicines, such as steroid inhalers, the CDC says. There's much room for improvement, Shimoide says. He says it was accidentally discovered that kampo herbs could wipe out symptoms in many people while testing the ancient remedy against an allergic skin disorder known as atopic dermatitis. So his team studied 278 people with asthma who suffered daily symptoms of the disease. Of those, 52 were given standard treatment (typically an inhaled steroid and a bronchodilator), and 226 were treated with kampo herbs. Symptoms completely disappeared in 94% of patients taking kampo herbs after an average of 16 days, Shimoide says. In contrast, about three-fourths of those taking standard asthma medications still had daily wheeze and other symptoms.\n\nThe study did not look at possible side effects of kampo herbs. But a major problem facing kampo medicine is herbal product quality. There have been cases in which poisonous plants found their way into the herbal mix, resulting in kidney damage, for example. In kampo medicine, most herbs are taken as a fixed formula. Each individual herb is thought to address a particular imbalance in an ill person.

Mehnert, MD, director of the Phase I and Developmental Therapeutics Program at Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, is the lead author of research highlighting the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab and its effect on advanced thyroid cancer. The work is being presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting which begins tomorrow in Chicago. Dr. Mehnert, who is also a medical oncologist in the Melanoma and Soft Tissue Oncology Program at Rutgers Cancer Institute, shares more about the research:\nQ: How was the study structured?A: At the time our abstract was submitted, 22 patients with a diagnosis of advanced or metastatic papillary or follicular thyroid cancer who failed prior standard therapy were accrued from multiple international sites. Participants received 10 mg of pembrolizumab every two weeks for up to 24 months or until confirmed progression or unacceptable toxicity. Safety, tolerability and response were assessed every eight weeks for the first six months and every 12 weeks thereafter.\nQ: What did you find?A: At the time we reported our results, six of the 22 patients remained on treatment. Of those who completed therapy, two patients had a partial response for an overall response rate of 9.1 percent, and there was a stable disease rate of 54.5 percent. The six-month overall survival rate was 100 percent and the six month progression free survival rate was 58.7 percent. Updated results will be announced at the annual meeting. There were no treatment-related deaths or therapy discontinuations due to drug-related adverse effects. Overall, pembrolizumab shows promising antitumor activity in advanced cases of follicular or papillary thyroid cancer which progressed on standard treatment. The clinical benefit of pembrolizumab in advanced thyroid cancer will be further studied in a follow-up phase II clinical trial that is now ongoing to try to discover biomarkers which predict response to treatment with pembrolizumab.\n", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The release contains no description of funding sources or conflicts.

FDA approved the quadrivalent formulation (\"Flublok Quadrivalent\") in October 2016 that will be commercially available for everyone over 18 years for the 2017/18 influenza season. Flublok is the only flu vaccine made in a 100% egg-free system using modern cell culture technology, making it unnecessary to use an infectious influenza virus, antibiotics or harsh chemicals (e.g., formaldehyde) in manufacturing. Flublok is highly purified and does not contain any preservatives (e.g., thimerosal - a form of mercury), egg proteins, gelatin or latex. In addition, Flublok contains three times more antigen than traditional flu vaccines (3x45mcg hemagglutinin protein versus 3x15mcg hemagglutinin protein). In a 2014/15 post-marketing study of 9,000 adults 50 years and older, people who received Flublok were over 40% less likely to develop cell culture confirmed influenza than people who received a traditional flu vaccine.

This data satisfies both pre-specified criteria for non-inferiority and superiority of Flublok over the traditional egg-based quadrivalent inactivated vaccine.

Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. But because vision damage often occurs gradually, most people with the eye disease do not realize they have it until a good deal of their sight has been lost. If caught early, though, there are medications and procedures that may help treat glaucoma. In the study, researchers were able to predict who was at increased risk of developing the eye disease with some accuracy by measuring blood vessel thickness in the retinas of study participants using a computer-based imaging tool. Those with the narrowest vessels at the beginning of the study were four times more likely to have developed glaucoma a decade later.\n\nAbout 3 million Americans and 60 million people worldwide have glaucoma, and the numbers are projected to rise over the next few decades as the population ages.

But defining medical necessity is complicated. Natural-birth advocates cite a \"cascade of interventions\" caused by hospitals' practice of using the drug Pitocin to stimulate labor. The drug can cause painful contractions, which doctors treat with an epidural painkiller. The epidural can then retard contractions and lead to more drugs, fetal stress and the doctor's recommendation of a Caesarean. Natural-birth advocates say that hospitals, driven by profits and worried about malpractice, are too quick to intervene. \"I compare it to a restaurant. If you have customers who sit at a table and don't order anything, you're not making any money,\" says Jennifer Block, author of \"Pushed: The Painful Truth About Childbirth and Modern Maternity Care.\" Normal labor, Block says, isn't profitable (according to \"The Business of Being Born,\" a Caesarean can cost three times as much as a normal birth). If something does go wrong, in the eyes of the courts \"a normal birth is a risk. The courts reward action,\" Block says.\nAlthough the United States has one the highest rates of Caesareans\u2014and of infant mortality\u2014Villar says the rest of the developed world is catching up. But opinion differs on how to respond. Doctors such as Stark say we need a better sense of what goes on while the baby is still in utero. \"One of the knowledge gaps is a clear understanding of the indications for C-sections,\" she says. (Known indications include breech position of the fetus, and pre-existing medical conditions such as extreme hypertension in the mother.) Naomi Wolf, author of \"Misconceptions: Truth, Lies, and the Unexpected on the Journey to Motherhood,\" blames insurance companies and hospitals, who she says deny women information about their choices. Wolf and other natural-birth advocates say we need a better idea of what normal birth looks like, as movies and TV usually depict the process as painful and bloody. \"We all have this idea that normal birth is a woman lying in a hospital bed screaming,\" says Block. If nothing else, \"The Business of Being Born,\" with its indelible image of a naked, exhilarated Ricki Lake cooing \"Hi there!\" to her seconds-old son in her bathtub, will give them another view.\nThere are many births in the documentary film \"The Business of Being Born,\" including a scene of former talk-show host Ricki Lake giving birth naked in her tub. But the image that viewers may find most shocking is that of a baby being cut out of a woman's abdomen via Caesarean. This, according to Lake, the executive producer of the film, and Abby Epstein, the film's director, is the right reaction: one of their messages is that C-sections should only be performed when needed to guarantee the well-being of the mother and infant, and should not be a first choice for healthy mothers. New research into the risks associated with elective Caesareans supports their view. In a study, published in October's British Medical Journal, of 97,000 deliveries in 410 Latin American hospitals, perinatal specialist Dr. Jose Villar found the risk of death for mothers who had Caesareans, while slight (.01 percent of the women who delivered vaginally died vs. .04 percent who had elective C-sections), was triple that of those who delivered vaginally. \"The C-section increases risk because it's major surgery,\" Villar says. Mothers who had undergone a Caesarean were also more likely to need blood transfusions and stay in the hospital more than a week after delivery. The risk of death for infants delivered via C-section\u2014who are more likely to have a low birth weight\u2014was double that of vaginal births, and C-section babies were more likely to have respiratory problems. According to a study published in the journal Birth, labor clears liquid from the infant's lungs, preparing the baby to breathe outside the womb. Caesareans impede this process. Yet the rate of Caesareans is spiking: in 2006, C-sections accounted for 31.1 percent of births nationwide, a 50 percent increase over the past 10 years. Natural birth\u2014without drugs or interventions\u2014whether at home or in a hospital, remains a rarity (despite the fact that home births don't have an appreciably higher risk rate than hospital births).\n", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story quotes multiple sources, however only two of them are clinical experts, the others are authors of books or filmmakers.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "This compared with 1.9 percent using mitoxantrone.\nThe FDA\u2019s review should happen in the third quarter, Sanofi said.\n\u201cThe development of cabazitaxel is one of many investigational compounds we hope to present to the cancer community in the months and years to come,\u201d Debasish Roychowdhury, Sanofi\u2019s oncology senior vice president, said.\n", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "\u00a0No independent sources were quoted to evaluate the claims made by the drug company.

Most came from people who got Botox to erase their wrinkles, but the 28 deaths occurred in people who had received it for medical purposes. The FDA didn't do much in response, but since then it has been getting new reports of serious adverse reactions in people receiving Botox, and launched a safety review. An analysis of the FDA's database by the advocacy group Public Citizen found 16 deaths from Botox or Myobloc. Most involved children with serious diseases like cerebral palsy, who got the injections for muscle spasms (an unapproved, though legal, use).

It also found that the protective effect increases with age. The study is by Peter Rothwell, MD, PhD, FRCP, of John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, England, and colleagues, and has been published online by the journal the Lancet. A previous study by the same authors showed that low doses of aspirin (75-300 milligrams) reduced the number of cases of colorectal cancer by a quarter and deaths caused by the disease by more than a third. The latest study confirms the earlier results and concludes that similar effects can be shown for other types of cancers.\n\nThe study looked at eight trials examining the effects of a daily dose of aspirin on preventing heart attacks involving 25,570 patients, 674 of whom died from cancer. They showed a 21% reduction in the number of deaths caused by cancer among those who had taken aspirin, compared with people who had not. The investigation also showed that the benefits of taking aspirin increased over time. After five years, death rates were shown to fall by 34% for all cancers and by 54% for gastrointestinal cancers. Participants were also followed up after 20 years, by which point 1,634 of the original participants had died as a direct result of cancer. This 20-year follow-up established that the risk of cancer death remained 20% lower among those who had been allocated aspirin than those in the control group for all solid cancers, including lung, prostate, brain, bladder, and kidney cancers, and by 35% for gastrointestinal cancers. The fall in the risk of death broke down according to individual types of cancer: Reductions in pancreatic, stomach, and brain cancers were difficult to quantify because of smaller numbers of deaths, the authors say.\n\nThe protective effect of taking low doses of aspirin varied according to the type of cancer and how long aspirin had been taken, the authors found.

It develops in the pleura, the thin layer of tissue surrounding the lungs. As the tumor grows, it restricts the lungs, typically causing shortness of breath, fatigue, weight loss and/or chest discomfort and pain. In PD surgery, the pleura is removed. While the procedure cannot cure mesothelioma, it can help control the buildup of fluid, improve breathing and lessen cancer pain.

The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery doesn't keep statistics on repeat customers, but obesity surgeons are reporting upticks. Dennis Halmi, a member of the Bluepoint Surgical Group in Woodbridge, says that in 2002 \"we did a handful\" of second operations on obesity patients, \"maybe five, six. This year we are doing probably 30.\" Scott Shikora of Tufts Medical Center in Boston says that until recently he hadn't performed a second obesity operation on anybody but is already up to about a half-dozen patients. Thayer was one of them.\nObesity surgeons, Fielding included, report a high success rate for the bypass. Bypass patients lose some 60 to 80 percent of their excess weight, and 60 to 80 percent of those patients keep off at least two-thirds of the weight they lose. Such people often experience a near-complete reversal of diabetes, sleep apnea, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, arthritis pain and a host of other health-compromising problems, frequently going from several prescription drugs a day to none.\nWhat obesity surgeons do feel confident saying is that no matter which type of surgery is chosen, and whether it's the first or second time, the patient has to meet the operation halfway. You \"still have to follow some semblance of dietary compliance,\" says Tufts's Shikora. \"You also have to be more physically active, take care of your health. And you have to follow up.\"\n", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Several clinicians were quoted as part of this story indicating that they were seeing an increased number of individuals seeking to have a second weight loss procedure because they felt gastric bypass was not sufficient to enable them to maintain their weight loss. \u00a0Beyond this, the story included no expert commenting with concrete information about the risks and benefits associated with this approach to weight control.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "FDA\u2019s approval of first 3-D-printed pill opens up endless possibilities for personalized medicine\nBased on other studies in the past that seemed to allude to marijuana use and later development of psychotic symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations, the researchers had thought they might find some associations to disease or other health conditions.

I want to also commend the pathologists at Valley, who were exceptional in their diagnostic results.\u201d Dr. Wilson and Laura Klein, M.D., Medical Director of the Breast Center, have extensive experience in performing nipple-sparing mastectomy, a technically demanding surgery that is performed within aesthetically appealing minimally invasive incisions. With expertise in minimally invasive oncoplastic breast surgery, Dr. Wilson has also studied complementary medicine and provides her patients with a holistic, integrative approach to breast care. \u201cIt\u2019s important to listen to each woman\u2019s needs and then to decide together what is the best approach to treatment, so that in the end the cancer will be gone and the woman can move on with her life,\u201d says Dr. Wilson.\nThe technique has the potential to be a \u201cgame-changer,\u201d says Tzvi Small, M.D., Director of the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at The Valley Hospital, who performed the breast reconstruction procedure on Hasbrouck Heights resident Vanessa Burt, 43.\n\u201cThis variation of a standard technique used during breast reconstruction will revolutionize the post-operative recovery in patients who meet certain criteria for the procedure,\u201d notes Dr. Small. \u201cHere at Valley, we are proud to offer this option for our patients and are excited about its potential for vastly improving patient care for women with breast cancer.\u201d The technique involves placing tissue expanders (interim implants) under the skin on top of a woman\u2019s pectoralis muscles after her breast tissue has been removed. After a recovery period of approximately two months \u2014 during which the woman\u2019s chest skin heals, blood supply replenishes, and the expanders are gradually inflated to stretch the skin \u2014 the patient returns for an outpatient surgical procedure to replace the tissue expanders with permanent breast implants. In addition to exceptional cosmetic results, the technique is likely to improve clinical outcomes as evidenced by ongoing research that shows women who undergo this procedure experience less pain and a shorter recovery period.\n", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The Valley Breast Center is listed at the end of the release.

And for those who start the intervention early and consumed it regularly, it can help to conserve memory and the ability to think and perform everyday tasks. The drink contains \"Fortasyn Connect\", a specific combination of fatty acids, vitamins and other nutrients.\nTobias Hartmann, the project's coordinator, said, \"We have known for a while that diet can reduce the risk of developing dementia. Indeed, certain nutrients have been found to have a neuroprotective effect on the brain. However translating this into an effective intervention hasn't been easy because single nutrients simply aren't powerful enough to fight a disease like Alzheimer's alone. Today's clinical trial results have shown that the key is combining certain nutrients, in order to increase their effect.\n", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The release focuses on the involvement of the European Commission, but it omits the involvement of Dannon, the massive food company, which holds the patent on the nutritional drink being studied.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Other serious adverse events associated with Avastin were blood clots in the lungs and nosebleeds, low white blood cell counts, fever along with a low white blood cell count and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), all of which occurred in 1 percent of the patients.\nThe report, which is funded by the maker of Avastin, F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., is published in the July 20 issue of The Lancet Oncology.

But Don't Think Of This As Birth Control Even though Clue\u2019s marketing director happened to find out she was pregnant from her Fitbit, the point of the study was to demonstrate that it's possible to use Fitbit as a conception tool, not as a pregnancy test, H\u00f6gqvist Tabor said. And that's provided that a couple doesn't have any other fertility-related problems.\n Fitbits aren't the only wearables that can track fertility-related biometrics in the background. After a Kickstarter campaign, YONO just started shipping an earpiece designed to track your body temperature at rest.
