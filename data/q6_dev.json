[{"article": "Insulin shots could become a thing of the past for type 1 diabetes patients thanks to a technology being developed by Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult, a London-based not-for-profit organisation, and Aberdeen University.\n\nThe pre-clinical results have encouraged CGT and Aberdeen University to create a spin-out company, called Islexa. It will manufacture lab-grown islets, the organoids responsible for insulin production, by reprogramming donated pancreatic tissue.\n\nOnly 30-50 people with type 1 diabetes in the UK currently receive an islet transplant each year, owing to a lack of donors and the difficulty of extracting islets from pancreatic tissue.\n\nGrowing islets will \u201csignificantly increase the number of patients who can receive the treatment,\u201d Keith Thompson, CGT\u2019s chief executive, told the World Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine congress in London on Wednesday. He will run Islexa with Michael Bennet from CGT and Anne Lewendon from Aberdeen University.\n\n\n\nIf clinical trials are successful, the technology means tens of thousands more people could live without the need for frequent insulin injections, although it will take a few years until the treatment is available.\n\nAbout 320,000 people in Britain have type 1 diabetes, a number set to more than double to 652,000 by 2035. Around the world, 21 million people have type 1 diabetes.\n\nIt is a lifelong condition that occurs when the pancreas does not produce any insulin, while type 2 diabetes \u2013 far more common, especially as obesity rises around the world \u2013 is a condition where the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or the body\u2019s cells do not react to it.\n\nProf Kevin Docherty, from Aberdeen University, said: \u201cDonated islets are already effectively treating severe cases of type 1 diabetes. Having a hugely expanded supply of lab-grown islets will enable us to significantly extend this established clinical treatment.\u201d\n\nCGT was set up in 2012 and is based on the 12th floor of Guy\u2019s hospital in London.

The open-surgery group also stayed in the hospital about one day longer than the robotic group.\n\nThe results were similar for people who had kidneys removed.\n\nThe trade-off was the cost, with robotic prostate removal costing about $10,000 on average, roughly $700 more than laparoscopic surgery and $1,100 more than open surgery.\n\nFor kidney removal, robotic surgery cost $13,900, which was $2,700 more than laparoscopic and $1,300 more than open surgery.\n\nDavid Penson, a surgeon at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who was not part of the study, said more consideration should have been given to the state of patients afterwards.

Two to three times a week was not enough, the researchers found in an earlier study.\n\n\"Based on a series of studies performed by our team over the past 5 years, this 'dose' of exercise has become my prescription for life,\" said senior author Dr. Benjamin Levine, Director of the Institute and Professor of Internal Medicine at UT Southwestern. \"I think people should be able to do this as part of their personal hygiene - just like brushing your teeth and taking a shower.\"\n\nThe regimen included exercising four to five times a week, generally in 30-minute sessions, plus warmup and cool-down:\n\u2022 One of the weekly sessions included a high-intensity 30-minute workout, such as aerobic interval sessions in which heart rate tops 95 percent of peak rate for 4 minutes, with 3 minutes of recovery, repeated four times (a so-called \"4 x 4\").\n\u2022 Each interval session was followed by a recovery session performed at relatively low intensity.\n\u2022 One day's session lasted an hour and was of moderate intensity. (As a \"prescription for life,\" Levine said this longer session could be a fun activity such as tennis, aerobic dancing, walking, or biking.)\n\u2022 One or two other sessions were performed each week at a moderate intensity, meaning the participant would break a sweat, be a little short of breath, but still be able to carry on a conversation -- the \"talk test.\" In the study, exercise sessions were individually prescribed based on exercise tests and heart rate monitoring.\n\u2022 One or two weekly strength training sessions using weights or exercise machines were included on a separate day, or after an endurance session.\n\nStudy participants built up to those levels, beginning with three, 30-minute, moderate exercise sessions for the first 3 months and peaked at 10 months when two high-intensity aerobic intervals were added.\n\nThe more than 50 participants in the study were divided into two groups, one of which received two years of supervised exercise training and the other group, a control group, which participated in yoga and balance training.\n\nAt the end of the two-year study, those who had exercised showed an 18 percent improvement in their maximum oxygen intake during exercise and a more than 25 percent improvement in compliance, or elasticity, of the left ventricular muscle of the heart, Dr. Levine noted. He compared the change in the heart to a stretchy, new rubber band versus one that has gotten stiff sitting in a drawer.\n\nSedentary aging can lead to a stiffening of the muscle in the heart's left ventricle, the chamber that pumps oxygen-rich blood back out to the body, he explained.\n\n\"When the muscle stiffens, you get high pressure and the heart chamber doesn't fill as well with blood. In its most severe form, blood can back up into the lungs. That's when heart failure develops,\" said Dr. Levine, who holds the S. Finley Ewing Chair for Wellness at Texas Health Dallas and the Harry S. Moss Heart Chair for Cardiovascular Research. He also holds the Distinguished Professorship in Exercise Sciences at UT Southwestern, which is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year.\n\nEarlier research by UT Southwestern cardiologists showed that left ventricular stiffening often shows up in middle age in people who don't exercise and aren't fit, leaving them with small, stiff chambers that can't pump blood as well.\n\nHowever, the researchers also found that the heart chamber in competitive masters-level athletes remains large and elastic, and that even four to five days of committed exercise over decades is enough for noncompetitive athletes to reap most of this benefit.\n\nIn the current study, researchers wanted to know if exercise can restore the heart's elasticity in previously sedentary individuals - especially if begun in late middle age. Previous studies from Dr. Levine's research program have shown substantial improvements in cardiac compliance in young individuals after a year of training, but surprisingly little change if the training was started after age 65.\n\nTo start the study, researchers recruited 53 participants, ages 45 to 64. Many came from the Dallas Heart Study, which includes 6,000 Dallas residents and is the only single-center heart study of its size and multiethnic composition. The Dallas Heart Study is designed to improve the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of heart disease.\n\nThe new study appears in Circulation, a journal of the American Heart Association. Collaborators on the study included first author Dr. Erin Howden, Research Fellow with UT Southwestern's Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and the IEEM and now a faculty member at the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne, Australia.

She recalls looking one of the physicians in the eye, defiant. \u201cI\u2019m done with this shit,\u201d she remembers saying. \u201cI\u2019m done with you guys bullying us.\u201d\n\nThen, she took out a bag and dumped the contents on the table: nine months of cancer drugs prescribed to her son, Landon, who was 4 at the time. He had been diagnosed more than a year before with an aggressive form of leukemia and undergone months of grueling treatment. But his mother was now refusing to follow his doctors\u2019 orders. \u201cListen: Here\u2019s all this chemo you told CPS he cannot live without, and if I didn\u2019t give it to him, he would relapse and die.\u201d\n\nBut Landon, who underwent only one year of cancer treatment instead of the recommended four, was still alive\u2014thriving, in fact\u2014even though he\u2019d stopped taking that massive pile of drugs prescribed for him. That\u2019s why his mother had called this meeting. She implored the CPS director\u2014whom by then she knew by first name\u2014to restrain the oncologists who had threatened to take her child away and put him in foster care. Riddle believes the doctors wanted to prove she was a neglectful, abusive mother, but she knew she could convince the world that the hospital was wrong about her son\u2019s treatment. (Due to HIPAA patient privacy laws, Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado was unable to comment on Landon\u2019s case for this story.)\n\nLandon\u2019s cancer, diagnosed in September 2012, had put Riddle in a situation that\u2019s any parent\u2019s worst nightmare: She had to watch him undergo lifesaving treatment that appeared to be killing him. Riddle says she was left with no choice but to defy his doctors\u2019 orders.\n\nRELATED: What we know about how cancer starts could all be wrong\n\nIn January 2013, nearly four months after Landon\u2019s initial diagnosis, the two went from Utah to Colorado, where Riddle purchased an alternative treatment fraught with complicated politics and plenty of skepticism\u2014especially when it comes to saving the life of a preschooler with a potentially fatal disease. At the time, Colorado was one of only about a dozen states in the U.S. that had legalized medical cannabis. It also allowed sick children to access the drug under professional guidance. Landon became the youngest patient in the U.S. at that time to receive a medical marijuana card. Riddle\u2019s decision to treat her child with cannabis landed the family in the center of a contentious national debate, as well as on prime-time television with CNN\u2019s chief medical correspondent, Sanjay Gupta. In Utah, all cannabis is illegal, so when their story went public, she and Landon had to move permanently to Colorado, so he could continue to have access to the drug. Even now, at 7, he still needs to take cannabis to cope with the long-term effects of chemotherapy and radiation, she says.\n\nBy the time of that showdown with CPS and Landon\u2019s doctors in Denver, Riddle had stopped giving her son all of the drugs prescribed by the hospital: the chemo, opiates and benzos. The latter two\u2014which included OxyContin, morphine and Ativan\u2014were prescribed to help Landon cope with the side effects of cancer treatment. None of them helped, she says, or they made him feel worse. But when Landon started the cannabis oil, his health miraculously improved. She was willing to do whatever it took to keep him on cannabis.\n\nAs laws that permit medical cannabis have expanded nationwide (29 states in the country now permit some form of cannabis use for medical purposes), cancer patients increasingly use the drug to alleviate the harsh symptoms of chemotherapy, such as nausea, anxiety, loss of appetite and insomnia. But there\u2019s also an emerging body of research that suggests marijuana might be effective as a treatment for cancer on its own, or in conjunction with standard therapies.\n\nWhen Riddle made the decision to give her son cannabis, the information on its safety and efficacy was (and still is) limited to anecdotal accounts, a handful of case reports and lab studies published in obscure medical journals. Initially, her hope was that the drug would lessen the side effects. But Riddle soon heard that certain compounds in cannabis\u2014cannabinoids\u2014have been shown to induce cancer cell death. The theory seemed to be especially promising for leukemia, at least according to studies done on cancer cells in test tubes and on mice injected with human leukemia cells. But at that point there wasn\u2019t any evidence it would work for humans. There still isn\u2019t. While cannabis is legal in many U.S. states, the drug is still classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a Schedule 1 narcotic (along with heroin and cocaine), which make it very difficult for scientists to conduct clinical trials on people. However, that may change as other nations, such as Israel, take the lead and fund marijuana research.\n\nThe findings so far from published lab studies suggest cannabidiol (CBD), one of more than 100 cannabinoids present in the plant, targets certain pathways in leukemia. The evidence indicates that leukemia cells have a high number of cannabinoid receptors\u2014primarily the receptor CB2. The proteins on the cell membrane (receptors) recognize the chemical compound, CBD. The shape of the receptor mirrors the shape of the compound, enabling the CBD to land and attach to the cell. \u201cIt\u2019s like a key in the lock,\u201d says Dr. Bonni Goldstein, medical director of Canna-Centers in Los Angeles and the medical adviser to Weedmaps.com, a resource for people seeking specialists to oversee their medical cannabis treatment. \u201cWhen compounds such as cannabidiol bond to receptors, it causes the cell to die.\u201d\n\nFurther studies are needed to verify that CBD could potentially kill leukemia, says Robert McKallip, an associate professor of immunology at Mercer University School of Medicine, who conducted some of the earliest research on the anti-leukemia properties of compounds found in cannabis. McKallip suggests cannabis could be used along with other treatments for leukemia. \u201cCombined with other targeted therapies, which again, specifically target the leukemia, you give it a one-two punch and hopefully reduce side effects and improve efficacy of treatment,\u201d he says.\n\nRiddle isn\u2019t a doctor, but she theorizes that while the chemo initially cleared Landon\u2019s cancer, it\u2019s the cannabis that has kept his disease from coming back. Oncologists who treat pediatric patients often tell families that when the five-year mark passes, their child is in the clear. It\u2019s been nearly five years since Riddle sat in that conference room meeting; Landon is still cancer-free. Riddle says that once he hits the five-year mark this fall, he\u2019ll set a precedent for pediatric leukemia patients in the U.S., and maybe even worldwide.\n\nRiddle, a single mother, was willing to do whatever it would take to rid Landon of the cancer in his blood that had spread to his brain and formed a tumor in his chest the size of a large grapefruit. She desperately wanted to trust the doctors at the Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake City, where her son was diagnosed at age 2, and who admitted to her that they weren\u2019t sure they could save his life.\n\nShe knew the leukemia treatment protocols are backed by decades of research. But they are infamously rough for a child and drag on for years. First, there would be several months of aggressive inpatient chemo and other therapies for what\u2019s known as \u201cremission reduction.\u201d After that, even when blood work showed the disease had entered remission, Landon would need years of chemo and monitoring\u2014called \u201cconsolidation\u201d\u2014to make sure his body wasn\u2019t harboring leukemia cells.\n\nThis aggressive approach is one of the main reasons pediatric leukemia, depending on its more specific classification, has at least an 80 to 90 percent survival rate. The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society estimates that nearly 5,000 kids will be diagnosed in the U.S. with some form of leukemia in 2017. For most of the kids who go through the entire course of treatment, the illness turns out to be a mere blip on the screen of childhood. Riddle hoped the same would be true for her son. But Landon appeared to be among a small percentage of children with leukemia for whom the treatment was unbearable, excruciating. The chemo caused him to vomit up to 50 times a day, which made it difficult for him to speak because his esophagus was burned and closed up. The chemo had compromised his immune system so severely that he caught every bug in the hospital, just about every strain of stomach viruses, influenza and the common cold. He eventually developed numbness, tingling, pain and weakness (neuropathy) in his feet and ankles, and was no longer able to walk.\n\nWithin the first 90 days of treatment, Landon lost half his body weight. He stopped eating for more than a month. He needed blood and platelet transfusions. Doctors kept adding prescription after prescription to alleviate the side effects of treatment\u2014narcotics, anti-depressants, anti-anxiety drugs, prescriptions for pain. \u201cThe sad thing is they didn\u2019t seem to help Landon,\u201d she says. \u201cAt this point, they kept telling us we have to keep going. I said, \u2018He\u2019s dying. It\u2019s very apparent that he\u2019s dying.\u2019\u201d\n\nLandon began to refuse chemotherapy and turn into a \u201clittle psychopath,\u201d says Riddle. He kicked and screamed when nurses forced pills into his mouth, so eventually everything needed to be administered with an IV. \u201cThe chemo actually has healed a lot of kids, but it almost killed me,\u201d he says.\n\nMost children with leukemia go into remission within the first 30 days of treatment, which was why Landon\u2019s doctors insisted on several more years of chemotherapy, says Riddle. By the time Landon was nearing the end of his first stage of treatment, Riddle says her son was on the brink of death. The doctors told her to bring him home for a two-week break from chemo, adding that they would arrange to send a hospice nurse\u2014an ominous hint that Landon was about to die.\n\nA plea for help posted on Facebook by Riddle\u2019s mother, Wendy, led the family to a group of brothers in Denver, the Stanleys, who were cultivating cannabis for medicinal purposes and had made the news for a strain they called Charlotte\u2019s Web. Riddle and her mother had seen the story about Charlotte Figi, a 6-year-old girl with Dravet syndrome, a rare type of epilepsy that was unresponsive to standard treatment. She had up to 300 seizures per day. But the seizures stopped when she began taking CBD oil supplied by the brothers.\n\nThe Stanleys visited the Riddles in Utah to educate them about Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)\u2014the psychoactive chemical in the plant\u2014and CBD. She decided to start Landon on cannabis. But to do that, the family would need to leave Utah, where all cannabis is illegal. So Riddle and Landon moved in with the brothers for about a year, says Joel Stanley, the CEO of the company that is now known as CW Hemp. \u201cIt was just so sad to see someone that young and that small going through such harsh treatment,\u201d Stanley says of Landon. \u201cHe also had elements of what I know a lot of folks would call \u2018chemo brain.\u2019 He would get very frustrated and very angry, all normal because his little body was just being invaded by this intense medication and rounds of chemotherapy treatment.\u201d Throughout that year, Riddle and her son traveled back and forth from Colorado to Utah, so he could continue chemo, but this time with the aid of cannabis, to make treatment more bearable. That meant Riddle had the drug on hand, and Landon was under its influence while in Utah, which made mother and son both felons.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "There are quotes from multiple experts.

Attacks can last anything from four to 72 hours.\n\nEach year more than 8.5 million people in the UK are thought to experience migraine \u2013 more than the number affected by asthma, diabetes and epilepsy combined.\n\nThe condition is linked to depression and sick days caused by migraine are estimated to cost the UK economy more than \u00a32bn per year.\n\nThe trial, called Strive, compared patients taking erenumab for six months with others given a non-active placebo dummy drug. \n\n\n\nThe research revealed that by months four to six, at least a 50% reduction in mean migraine days per month was achieved for just over 43% of patients injected under the skin with 70-mg of erenumab each month, while half of patients injected with the higher dose of 140-mg had such results. However, those given a placebo also saw benefits, with 26.6% of participants in this group experiencing such a reduction.\n\n\n\nLead investigator Prof Peter Goadsby, from King\u2019s College hospital, London, said: \u201cStrive \u2026 represents an incredibly important step forward for migraine understanding and migraine treatment.\u201d\n\nThe findings, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, clearly showed that blocking the CGRP pathway could reduce the impact of migraine, he said. \u201cThe results of Strive represent a real transition for migraine patients from poorly understood, re-purposed treatments, to a specific migraine-designed therapy.\u201d\n\nSimon Evans, chief executive of the charity Migraine Action, said: \u201cMigraine is too often trivialised as just a headache when, in reality, it can be a debilitating, chronic condition that can destroy lives. The effects can last for hours, even days in many cases.\n\n\u201cAn option that can prevent migraine and that is well tolerated is therefore sorely needed, and we hope that this marks the start of real change in how this condition is treated and perceived.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cBroadly speaking I think this is a very interesting study and I think it is a good step forward for the field and I think it is a good day for migraine sufferers,\u201d said professor Zameel Cader, Director of the Oxford Headache Centre who was not involved in the research, pointing out that the results were on a par with currently available therapies for migraine.\n\n\u201cPlacebo responses [in migraine studies] are quite high and I think that is partly due to the subjective nature of pain and because of the strong psychological effects that being treated have on that experience of pain and those symptoms,\u201d he said, adding that injections generally result in an even stronger placebo effect than tablets.\n\n\n\nCader said that he too was looking at running trials using antibodies, and said he was excited about the approach since it might result in fewer side effects than current therapies, and would mean individuals would not have to remember to take a table every day.\n\n\u201cThis is probably the first example of a migraine preventing drug that was rationally designed, rather than serendipitously found,\u201d he added.\n\nAmgen and Novartis, the codevelopers of erenumab, funded the trial, while Amgen also supplied the drug and conducted the data analyses.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Many news stories fail this test, but this one shines: Not only does the article cite an expert who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, but it also discloses that the drugmakers of erenumab \u2014 Amgen and Novartis \u2014 funded the study, supplied the drug, and did the data analyses.

Immunotherapy has been shown to be effective in other types of lung cancer, and now we\u2019re seeing encouraging improvements in advanced squamous lung cancer, which historically has been very difficult to treat,\u201d said ASCO Expert David Graham, MD, FASCO.\n\nCHICAGO \u2013 Initial findings from a randomized phase III clinical trial show that patients with advanced squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) benefit more from initial treatment with PD-L1 targeted immunotherapy atezolizumab (Tecentriq\u00ae) and chemotherapy than from chemotherapy alone -- 29% had a reduced risk of disease worsening or death compared with those who received chemotherapy alone. At 12 months, cancer had not worsened in twice as many patients who received atezolizumab plus chemotherapy compared to those who only received chemotherapy. This benefit was observed across all PD-L1 expressing sub-groups.\n\nThe findings will be featured in a press briefing today and presented at the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting.\n\n\u201cUntil now, there have been few treatment advances for squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. Our findings may provide a new potential treatment option for this type of cancer,\u201d said lead study author Robert M. Jotte, MD, PhD, Medical Director and Co-Chair, USON Thoracic Committee, Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers in Denver, CO. \u201cWe used to think that chemotherapy just knocked down the patient\u2019s immune system and that it would be irrational to combine it with immunotherapy, but growing research, including this study, shows that chemotherapy can help trigger the immune response to the tumor, helping the immunotherapy treatment work better.\u201d\n\nSquamous NSCLC, which accounts for 25-30% of NSCLCs, is very difficult to treat. Fewer than 15% of people with advanced squamous NSCLC survive a year after diagnosis, and less than 2% survive five years.\n\nRecent studies have also found a benefit of combining immunotherapy with chemotherapy in non-squamous lung cancer. Given those findings, along with the results from this trial, a rapid change in clinical practice is expected, noted Dr. Jotte.\n\nAbout the Study\n\n The IMpower131 trial enrolled 1,021 patients with stage IV squamous NSCLC. Tumors were tested for PD-L1 expression, but patients were included in the trial regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression level. Patients with EGFR or ALK gene changes in the tumor received targeted treatments before starting therapy on this trial. The study participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. Outcomes for only two of the groups, however, are being reported in this presentation:\n\nOutcome data for the third treatment group, which received atezolizumab with a slightly different chemotherapy regimen (carboplatin and paclitaxel), are not yet available.\n\nKey Findings \n\n In this study, 29% of all patients, regardless of PD-L1 expression, had a reduced risk of disease worsening or death, compared with those who received chemotherapy alone. Importantly, there was a doubling of progression-free survival (PFS) benefit with this combination: at 12 months, cancer had not worsened in 24.7% patients receiving immunotherapy and chemotherapy, compared to 12% of those receiving chemotherapy alone.\n\nImproved progression-free survival was observed in all groups of patients who received immunotherapy and chemotherapy, including those with PD-L1-negative tumors and liver metastases. Overall survival data are not yet mature.\n\nThis is the first phase III trial of an immunotherapy-based combined modality treatment to show a significant improvement in progression-free survival in advanced squamous NSCLC, according to the authors. Although the difference between treatment groups is modest, a statistically significant improvement shows that, overall, people with advanced squamous lung cancer can benefit when immunotherapy is added to standard treatment, according to the authors.\n\nAlthough the rate of severe side effects was higher with the combined modality treatment than with chemotherapy alone (68% vs. 57%), it had a manageable safety profile, consistent with known safety risks of the individual therapies. The most common side effects of atezolizumab included skin rash, colitis, and low thyroid hormone.\n\nAt this interim analysis a statistically significant overall survival (OS) benefit was not observed (median OS was 14 months for atezolizumab plus chemotherapy vs. 13.9 months for chemotherapy alone). Researchers are continuing to follow patients and anticipate a subsequent analysis later this year.\n\nNext Steps\n\n More research is needed to determine which patients benefit the most from the addition of immunotherapy to standard chemotherapy. The researchers will explore tumor PD-L1 expression and other molecular markers, such as tumor mutational burden (TMB), that may predict whether a patient will benefit from this treatment regimen.\n\nThis study received funding from F.

And, for unknown reasons, the U.S. rate of preterm delivery has been going up in recent years.\n\nThat's why it's a pretty big deal that the Food and Drug Administration has OK'd a drug, called 17-HP, that experts say could make a dent in the preemie problem.\n\nNot a huge dent, but a significant one. The March of Dimes calculates that if all the women eligible to get the newly approved drug actually did, there would be 10,000 fewer preemies a year \u2013 out of more than half-a-million born that way.\n\n\"Although that may seem like a small percent, it's really a very extraordinary ability to impact on what is really a major public health problem,\" Dr. Alan Fleischman, the March of Dimes medical director, told Shots.\n\nAccording to the best research, the drug reduces the risk of premature birth by one-third among women who are at high risk because they had a previous preterm birth.\n\nThe drug is not for women whose prior premature births were of twins or other multiple births, or who are carrying more than one fetus in their current pregnancy. Nor is it for women who have other conditions that raise their risk of preterm birth, such as high blood pressure or infection.\n\nAnd even for the 30,000 or so women who are eligible, 17-HP, which will be marketed as Makena, isn't a magic bullet. The study showed that 37 percent of women who got weekly injections of it delivered prematurely, compared to 55 percent of women who got injections of a placebo.\n\nInterestingly, the drug is not new \u2014 it's just taken a long and circuitous route to approval.\n\nIn 1956, the FDA approved 17-HP for the treatment of certain cancers and other hormonal disorders, under the brand name Delalutin. But its manufacturer withdrew it from the market in 2000 \"for reasons unrelated to safety,\" as the FDA puts it.\n\nIn fact, as a Federal Register posting last year chronicled, there have been questions raised about whether 17-HP caused birth defects of various kinds. In the 1970s, the FDA required warnings on drugs containing progesterone, as 17-HP does, because of an increased risk of birth defects. They later revoked them.\n\nThe FDA is apparently satisfied that 17-HP is safe, but it's requiring its sponsors KV Pharmaceuticals and TherRx to conduct further studies of women who have taken it and children exposed during pregnancy.\n\nEveryone in this field is mindful of the long-running tragedy of vaginal and other cancers and male urinary disorders that resulted from the last drug thought to prevent premature birth \u2013 a synthetic estrogen called diethylstilbesterol, or DES. In 1971 researchers realized children exposed to DES in utero had a higher incidence of vaginal and breast cancers, and males were subsequently found to have urinary-tract problems.\n\nFleischman, the March of Dimes official, says there's no such risk from 17-HP, partly because it's not used before the 16th week of pregnancy, when fetal organs have already formed.\n\n\"We have been very aggressively tracking all the data,\" Fleischman says, \"and we have no reason to believe that this drug will increase birth defects.\"", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The medical director of The March of Dimes was quoted throughout.

This means that many currently available drugs simply won't affect it.\n\n\"We were surprised [at the results] because triple-negative breast cancer is very difficult to treat,\" said study lead author Dr. Joyce O'Shaughnessy.\n\n\"The big, big surprise was survival,\" added O'Shaughnessy, who nevertheless stressed that the trial was small and preliminary.\n\nThe findings were enough to generate the interest of Dr. Lisa A.

Most of those trials were funded and run by the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture Prozac and Effexor \u2014 Eli Lilly and Wyeth, respectively.\n\nThey included 12 studies of Prozac in adults and four each in elderly patients and youth, as well as 21 trials of immediate- or extended-release Effexor in adults.

The task force recommended that women begin having screening mammograms at age 50 -- not 40 -- and that those exams occur every other year, instead of annually.\n\nBut some cancer organizations reject the panel's advice. The American Cancer Society still recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40, as long as a woman is still in good health.\n\nOn Tuesday, the American College of Radiology (ACR), the Society of Breast Imaging and the American Society of Breast Disease launched \"Mammography Saves Lives,\" a campaign designed to encourage women to have an annual mammogram starting at age 40.\n\n\"Mammography is not perfect; no one has claimed that it is,\" said Kopans, a member of the ACR Commission on Breast Imaging. But since the advent of routine mammograms in the 1990s, the rate of death from breast cancer has dropped 30 percent, he observed.\n\n\"That's a huge achievement,\" Kopans noted, adding that \"it may not be a big deal to an epidemiologist who's looking at huge numbers and doesn't take care of women with breast problems.\"\n\nNorway's breast cancer screening program began in 1996 and was expanded two years later, with staggered enrollment by county over a period of nine years. Since 2005, all Norwegian women aged 50 to 69 have been invited to have a screening mammogram every two years, the authors said.\n\nFor the study, more than 40,000 Norwegian women were followed for an average of 2.2 years. Researchers compared death rates from breast cancer among four groups of women: two that were living in counties with or without screening and two groups that lived in the same counties before screening was offered.\n\nThe difference in the rate of death from breast cancer among women in the screening group versus the control group was 28 percent. In comparison, there was an 18 percent reduction in the rate of death in the non-screened group versus the control group, the study found.\n\nIn other words, breast cancer screening was associated with a reduction in death -- but only accounted for 10 percentage points of the difference.\n\n\"Our observed 10 percent reduction in death from breast cancer is much lower than previously thought,\" Kalager said. \"It is plausible that today, the effect of increased breast awareness and improved therapy have outweighed the effect of screening on reducing mortality from breast cancer.\"\n\nBoth Kopans and Dr. Otis W.

Some prostate cancers evolve to use energy from lipids (fat). Previous work shows that metabolizing lipids helps prostate cancer escape anti-androgen therapy. However, there are many steps involved in lipid metabolism and researchers have been working to break prostate cancer\u2019s ability to harness this energy source. In this study the researchers focused on the CPT1A enzyme. CPT1A helps facilitate the entry of long chain fatty acids into the cell\u2019s mitochondria for oxidation. This oxidation is vital to lipid metabolism and has been shown to aid cancer cell survival, resistance to radiation, oxidative stress, and activation of oncogenic signaling pathways.\n\n\u201cWe had to find a way to block this pathway so that the cancer would not be able to burn lipid in the mitochondria to acquire energy to resist therapy,\u201d explains Schlaepfer.\n\nIn fact, we are already able to block the action of the CPT1A enzyme. The drug ranolazine is a fat oxidation inhibitor that earned FDA approval in 2006 to treat angina. When Schlaepfer and colleagues experimented with fat burning inhibitors and anti-androgens in cancer cell lines, they found that the addition of ranolazine to anti-androgen therapy made tumors more sensitivity to the anti-androgen drug enzalutamide.\n\n\u201cThis finding may have a huge impact on patients with CRPC that had very few options before,\u201d says Schlaepfer. \u201cSince the drugs are clinically safe, a clinical trial can be designed in patients for whom enzalutamide is prescribed.\u201d", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The funders aren\u2019t named in the news release.

He wasn't doing his homework. He was being very difficult with his little brother. And he was just melting down day after day,\" Ellison says. \"So I decided to devote a year to trying out different approaches to see if we could make it any better.\"\n\nIn recent years, more people have been trying an alternative approach called neurofeedback, a type of therapy intended to teach the brain to stay calm and focused. Neurofeedback is expensive, time consuming and still scientifically unproved. But, there's growing evidence that it can help.\n\nEllison says the idea appealed to her immediately.\n\n\"Because I was always wary about using meds as a single approach or for very long, it seemed to be an interesting alternative. It's really like meditation on steroids,\" says Ellison, a journalist who won a Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting -- and who has ADHD herself.\n\nEllison has written a book about living with ADHD called Buzz: A Year of Paying Attention. And one chapter of the book is devoted to neurofeedback.\n\nEllison says she tried meditation, but her mind kept wandering. Neurofeedback is better for people with ADHD, she says, because it provides constant feedback during a session, which is usually done in a therapist's office.\n\nPeople usually sit in a chair facing a laptop screen. The laptop is connected to electrodes applied to the scalp. Special software monitors the electrical activity in your brain. In particular, it measures rhythmic patterns known as theta and beta waves.\n\nProponents of neurofeedback say these patterns reveal when the brain is in a focused and attentive state. So the computer software looks for desirable brain wave patterns and changes the image on screen to let people know how they are doing.\n\nThe image that worked best for Ellison showed a field.\n\n\"When my brain responded the way that it was supposed to, the field would burst into color. I'd hear bird song and beautiful flowers would bloom,\" she says. \"But when I got distracted or when I got a little bit more sped up, the flowers would wilt. It would turn gray, and I'd know that I needed to work a little bit harder.\"\n\nAt first, people can't control their brain wave patterns, at least not consciously. But over time, their brains become conditioned to associate certain patterns with pleasant images or sounds -- a reward for good behavior. And our brains like rewards.\n\nThis sort of brain training can take 40 sessions or more, and typically costs thousands of dollars.\n\nEven though there are studies now showing that neurofeedback works for ADHD, all of these studies have serious limitations, researchers say. So the approach remains promising but unproved, says David Rabiner, a researcher at Duke University who writes a newsletter about treatments for ADHD.\n\n\"Parents do need to know that relative to treatments like medication treatment, to behavior therapy, at this point, the research base is not as extensive,\" Rabiner says.\n\nOn the other hand, Rabiner says, neurofeedback may offer something other treatments can't.\n\n\"The hope for neurofeedback is that after training ends, the benefits that resulted from training will persist -- that in some sense there's been more enduring change in the child's ability to focus and attend and to regulate their behavior,\" he says.\n\nBut it will take better research to figure out whether neurofeedback can live up to that promise, Rabiner says.\n\n\"There has been a need for some time to have the kind of carefully controlled study that would provide more definitive answers for parents and for the field,\" he says.\n\nAnd that research appears to be on the way.\n\nA team at The Ohio State University has nearly completed a pilot study of neurofeedback for ADHD that was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\nThe team had hoped to announce results last week at a scientific meeting in New York, but Gene Arnold, one of the scientists in charge of the study, says they had to delay that announcement because \"we weren't able to get the results analyzed in time,\" he says.\n\nThe results should be out within a few weeks, Arnold says. In the meantime, he says, the study has shown that it is possible to do neurofeedback research that involves a placebo.\n\nThe study used a video game involving race cars. For kids who got neurofeedback, he says, \"The ability to speed up the car and steer it was contingent on maintaining your brain waves in a more favorable ratio.\"\n\nBut other children got a placebo -- a race car that paid no attention to their brain waves.\n\nUntil a large study comes along using this sort of approach, parents and consumers will have to decide for themselves whether neurofeedback is worth the time and effort. Katherine Ellison says that for her and for her son, it was.\n\n\"What I noticed in my son was not necessarily that he'd stop losing things at school or do his homework better,\" she says. \"The improvement I saw was that he was easier to live with.\"\n\nBut brain training might not be the only reason, Ellison says. She says it might have been because she and her son spent so much time going to all those sessions together, and had pizza together afterward.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "In addition to extensive comments from the journalist book author who discusses her experience with neurofeedback, the story quotes a Duke University researcher who is an expert on ADHD and offers some counterbalancing perspective.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "An estimated 25 million to 45 million Americans suffer from irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS, a gastrointestinal condition that can cause miserable symptoms.

Study results were also endorsed in 11 accompanying editorials from leading experts in psychiatry, addiction, and palliative care.\n\n\u201cOur results represent the strongest evidence to date of a clinical benefit from psilocybin therapy, with the potential to transform care for patients with cancer-related psychological distress,\u201d says study lead investigator Stephen Ross, MD, director of substance abuse services in the Department of Psychiatry at NYU Langone.\n\n\u201cIf larger clinical trials prove successful, then we could ultimately have available a safe, effective, and inexpensive medication \u2014 dispensed under strict control \u2014 to alleviate the distress that increases suicide rates among cancer patients,\u201d says Ross, also an associate professor of psychiatry at NYU School of Medicine.\n\nStudy co-investigator Jeffrey Guss, MD, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at NYU Langone, notes that psilocybin has been studied for decades and has an established safety profile. Study participants, he says, experienced no serious negative effects, such as hospitalization or more serious mental health conditions.\n\nAlthough the neurological benefits of psilocybin are not completely understood, it has been proven to activate parts of the brain also impacted by the signaling chemical serotonin, which is known to control mood and anxiety. Serotonin imbalances have also been linked to depression.\n\nFor the study, half of the participants were randomly assigned to receive a 0.3 milligrams per kilogram dose of psilocybin while the rest received a vitamin placebo (250 milligrams of niacin) known to produce a \u201crush\u201d that mimics a hallucinogenic drug experience.\n\nApproximately half way through the study\u2019s monitoring period (after seven weeks), all participants switched treatments. Those who initially received psilocybin took a single dose of placebo, and those who first took niacin, then received psilocybin. Neither patients nor researchers knew who had first received psilocybin or placebo. Guss says, \u201cThe randomization, placebo control, and double-blind procedures maximized the validity of the study results.\u201d\n\nOne of the key findings was that improvements in clinical evaluation scores for anxiety and depression lasted for the remainder of the study\u2019s extended monitoring period \u2014 specifically, eight months for those who took psilocybin first.\n\nAll patients in the study \u2014 mostly women age 22 to 75 who are or were patients at the Perlmutter Cancer Center of NYU Langone \u2014 had either advanced breast, gastrointestinal, or blood cancers and had been diagnosed as suffering from serious psychological distress related to their disease. All patients, who volunteered to be part of the study, were provided with tailored counseling from a psychiatrist, psychologist, nurse or social worker, and were monitored for side effects and improvements in their mental state.\n\nCo-investigator Anthony Bossis, PhD, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at NYU Langone, says patients also reported post-psilocybin improvements in their quality of life: going out more, greater energy, getting along better with family members, and doing well at work. Several also reported variations of spirituality, unusual peacefulness, and increased feelings of altruism.\n\n\u201cOur study showed that psilocybin facilitated experiences that drove reductions in psychological distress,\u201d says Bossis. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s true for cancer care, then it could apply to other stressful medical conditions.\u201d\n\nBossis cautions that patients should not consume psilocybin on their own or without supervision by a physician and a trained counselor. He also says \u201cPsilocybin therapy may not work for everyone, and some groups, such as people with schizophrenia, as well as adolescents, should not be treated with it.\u201d\n\nBoth the NYU Langone and Johns Hopkins studies were principally funded by the Heffter Research Institute, a non-profit, scientific institution with the principal mission of helping to design, review and fund studies on the use of psilocybin for a wide range of ailments (Ross previously served as a board member).

Along with obesity, high levels of blood fats can lead to heart disease and other health problems, including diabetes.\n\nThe U.S. government currently recommends screening for high cholesterol in children with a family history of heart disease or high cholesterol (with at least one parent or grandparent who has suffered a premature heart event such as heart attack or stroke, or at least one parent with total cholesterol levels above 240 mg/dL). The guidelines also recommend that youngsters whose parents are not aware of their family history of heart disease be screened.\n\nIn the new study, led by Dr. William Neal of West Virginia University, scientists observed a group of more than 20,000 fifth-graders in West Virginia and found that 71% were eligible for cholesterol screening based on national criteria. Experts believe using family history is a good way to identify children who may be at greatest risk of high cholesterol \u0097 and therefore of future heart disease. Based on the results of the screen, doctors may then advise families to change their children's diet or exercise routines or prescribe medication to lower their cholesterol.\n\nBut because West Virginia has one of the nation's highest rates of death from heart disease, since 2000, the state has offered free, universal cholesterol screening to all fifth-graders enrolled in public schools. That allowed Neal and his team to determine how many children who actually had high cholesterol would have been missed if they had been screened based on federal guidelines.\n\nAmong the 5,798 children who would not have been screened, nearly 10% had elevated LDL cholesterol levels (above 130 mg/dL), according to the study, published in the August issue of Pediatrics. And 1.7% had levels high enough (above 160 mg/dL) to warrant cholesterol-lowering medications. Indeed, of all the children in the study whose LDL levels were above 160, one-third were in the group who would not have been screened.\n\nThe current guidelines were put in place in the 1990s, and at the time, experts predicted that high cholesterol would be missed in as many as 25% of children, says Neal. But doctors assumed that in most cases, these children would have only slightly elevated cholesterol levels that would eventually be detected when they became adults and would be lowered with diet and exercise.\n\nNeal's data show that may not be the case. Further, Neal says, the findings apply not only to heart-disease risk but also to the risk of diabetes, since high cholesterol at a young age is a strong predictor of prediabetes and diabetes. \"We worry about that because if these children don't change their ways, then they are going to have Type 2 diabetes,\" he says. \"It's something we would become more aware of if more children were screened.\"\n\nNot everyone agrees that universal screening is the answer. Rather than calling for all youngsters to have their cholesterol tested, which would entail considerable expense on the national level, Dr. Ralph Sacco, president of the American Heart Association (AHA), suggests looking more critically at current screening guidelines. \"Maybe the way we are doing family screening, with a very simplistic questionnaire about any parent having early heart disease or having high blood cholesterol, is not effective,\" he says. \"I think we need more effective screening tools. We need to assess these options before jumping to possible universal screening.\"\n\nSacco notes that both the AHA and the American Academy of Pediatrics now recommend cholesterol screening in children with risk factors for heart disease other than family history, such as obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes. \"The weight of the child, his waist circumference and whether he has siblings who are overweight would help to select a group that is at greater risk of having high cholesterol,\" he says. \"Now that we have this data, it does call into question these original guidelines from the government.\" The next update of the recommendations is expected in spring 2011.\n\nSee TIME's Pictures of the Week.\n\nSee the Cartoons of the Week.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "1clip_filelist.xml\" rel=\"File-List\"/>\n\n\n\n1clip_filelist.xml\" rel=\"File-List\"/>\n\n\n\nThe journal Pediatrics stated that the study authors did not have any relevant financial interests.

Rush began offering SAVI SCOUT, which has been used in more than 50 lumpectomy surgeries, in July.\n\nSAVI SCOUT allows a radiologist to insert a radar wave reflector the size of a grain of rice in the patient\u2019s breast up to 30 days before surgery to mark the location of the lesion, as shown with ultrasound or X-ray mammography. The reflector replaces the widespread current practice of inserting a thin, hooked wire into the breast the same day as surgery.\n\n\u201cWhen there is an abnormality that we can\u2019t feel and are unable to biopsy, we have to find that lesion in surgery,\u201d said Dr. Andrea Madrigrano, assistant professor of surgery at Rush University Medical Center.\n\nSAVI SCOUT replaces a more inconvenient technique used since '70s\n\nUsed since the 1970s, a hooked wire is placed in the breast through the skin to the abnormality using ultrasound or X-ray guidance with local anesthesia. The wire is placed into the breast to help guide the surgeon in removing the abnormality later that day.\n\n\u201cUntil now, a patient would go to the imaging center to have the thin wire precisely placed in the breast. The woman would then be taken to the operating room area,\u201d Madrigrano said.\n\nWire localization requires a high degree of coordination between radiology and surgical scheduling, which can lead to delays between placement of the wire and surgery, often requiring a woman to wait long periods of time with the wire in her breast.\n\n\u201cBefore surgery, these patients are in a hospital gown and are walking around while this wire is in place, which obviously is less than ideal for the patient,\u201d Madrigrano said.\n\n\u201cThe radar reflector is a replacement for the wire and is essentially a little marker. After the patient receives a local anesthetic, it can be placed into the breast using an extremely thin needle under image guidance days or weeks prior to surgery. Because this important step is out of the way in advance, it completely changes the patient\u2019s day of surgery experience.\u201d\n\nRadar can target abnormality within 1 mm, sparing more healthy tissue\n\nUnlike mastectomy, which treats breast cancer by removing an entire breast, lumpectomy surgery \u2014 also known as breast-conserving surgery \u2014 is used to remove only the tumor and a small amount of tissue surrounding the tumor. Using the SAVI SCOUT system technology, which emits 50 million radar pulses per second, surgeons can target the affected tissue within 1 millimeter of the reflector.\n\n\u201cWhen Madrigrano told me about it, I thought it was an ingenious idea and I\u2019m glad it was developed,\u201d said Nancy Morrissey, who underwent lumpectomy surgery at Rush in July using the SAVI SCOUT technology. \u201cIt made surgery go smoothly, and I didn\u2019t have any pain before or after.\n\n\u201cWhen the marker was inserted near the lump, it was similar to a biopsy. I was glad it was done a week before and not the same day as the lumpectomy surgery. I have been very impressed with the experience.\u201d According to Cianna Medical, the company that created SAVI SCOUT, 70 percent of women return to work the next day after the SCOUT procedure.\n\nIn addition to enhancing the patient\u2019s surgical experience, the more precise localization of the surgical site enable surgeons to plan the procedure better. That advantage may lead to less tissue needing to be removed and a better appearance of the breast after surgery.\n\n\u201cUltimately, this wireless technology has the potential to reduce surgical delays, and more importantly will benefit patients by increasing comfort and satisfaction during a stressful time,\u201d Madrigrano said.", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Since there\u2019s no study involved we rate the first half of this criterion (Funding Sources) Not Applicable.

Results of the study were published online Jan. 19 in The Lancet Oncology.\n\nThe HPV test should become the screening tool of choice for women 35 and older, the researchers said. It could be done less frequently than the Pap test, which could be used only in women who have tested positive for HPV, they said.\n\nThe Pap smear, first introduced in the 1950s, looks for changes in the cervix that could lead to cervical cancer. The HPV test works a step further back in the process, looking to see if women are infected with HPV.\n\nHPV causes cervical cancer, which remains a significant health problem, particularly in less resource-rich areas of the world.\n\nDNA testing for HPV, though, does have drawbacks -- namely that it is less specific, meaning it is likely to pick up more false-positives, than a Pap smear. This results in many more callbacks for women to undergo further testing.\n\nUsing HPV as a primary screening tool results in a callback rate of about 25 to 30 percent, said Dr. Mark Einstein, a gynecologic oncologist and director of clinical research at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City. By contrast, Pap smears have a callback rate of about 5 to 7 percent, he said.\n\nFor their study, the Italian researchers compared HPV testing alone with HPV testing plus a Pap smear in 94,370 women aged 25 to 60 years old.\n\nDuring the first phase of the study, women 35 to 60 who tested positive for HPV were given a cervical examination, called a colposcopy. Younger women got a colposcopy if their Pap smear was abnormal or if HPV results were positive several times, indicating that their body had not been able to clear the infection.\n\nScreening for HPV DNA appeared more effective in older women, but the testing in younger women led to over-diagnosis of a particular type of cervical lesion, the study found.\n\nNot all experts agree, though, that current practice would change based on the study's findings alone.\n\n\"I don't think this is going to change any strategies we do now, but I do think it's more evidence that HPV testing can predict who's going to develop cervical cancer,\" said Dr. Jay Brooks, chairman of hematology/oncology at Ochsner Health System in Baton Rouge, La. \"HPV testing, in certain populations, can really predict who would benefit from treatment.\"\n\nEinstein had a somewhat different take on the findings. \"This shows that the strategy does work,\" he said. \"It does make sense, it's cost-effective and effective. This is happening in single-payer health systems which have national screening. We're behind in the U.S.\"\n\nThe strategy makes particular sense in less-developed countries, where women could do an HPV test themselves with a \"self swab\" and then send the swab in for analysis, Einstein said.\n\nIn the United States, cervical cancer screening guidelines were changed in November. Women now are being told that they should get their first screening for cervical cancer -- including a Pap test -- at age 21. The previous recommendation was to start Pap tests three years after becoming sexually active or at age 21, whichever came first.\n\nAnd, rather than have an annual Pap test, most women need to be screened every other year or less, depending on their age, according to the new guidelines.\n\nCervical cancer rates have dropped more than 50 percent in the last 30 years in the United States, according to the guidelines. That decline has been largely attributed to widespread use of the Pap test.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on cervical cancer screening.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story quotes several sources who provide valuable perspectives.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "May 31, 2012 -- Should people at high risk of heart attack and stroke eat dark chocolate every day?\n\nMaybe, according to a new study from Australia.\n\n\"Dark chocolate may be a pleasant and effective way of delivering important dietary components that can provide health benefits to the ever increasing numbers of people at increased risk of cardiovascular disease,\" says researcher Christopher M.

It also appears to have less risk of causing lung problems than its inhaled predecessor, Exubera.\n\n\"Afrezza is an ultra-rapid-acting insulin, and clinical studies have shown us that it has the potential to change diabetes therapy, because in the body, Afrezza looks like the insulin that's normally in a person's body,\" said Andrea Leone-Bay, vice president of pharmaceutical development for MannKind Corp., manufacturer of Afreeza.\n\n\"Afrezza differs a lot from Exubera,\" she said, both in the way it's made and in the way it works.\n\nAfrezza uses a novel technology called Technosphere, according to Leone-Bay. It's inhaled as a dry powder that dissolves in the lungs. The particles then pass through the lungs into the bloodstream and begin acting almost immediately. Afrezza's action peaks about 12 to 15 minutes after inhalation, instead of the 45 to 60 minutes it takes for Exubera to peak, she said.\n\nThat fast action helps to keep after-meal blood sugar levels lower, which is a goal for people with diabetes. And Afrezza is less likely to cause hypoglycemia, a common problem that occurs when insulin levels are higher than required for a meal.\n\nThe idea of an inhaled insulin appeals to diabetics who must use insulin every time they eat. Currently, the only way to get that insulin is through injection or an insulin pump that must be inserted in a new site under the skin every few days.\n\nIn 2006, the first inhaled insulin, Exubera, received FDA approval. However, the drug was pulled from the market in October 2007 by its manufacturer, Pfizer, because of disappointing sales. From the beginning, concerns surfaced about the effects the drug might have on the lungs. One study found a reduction in lung function for some, but of more concern was an increased risk of lung cancer associated with its use. This finding came after Exubera had been pulled from the market, and the sample size wasn't large enough to draw a definitive link between the drug and the increased risk of lung cancer.\n\nLeone-Bay said that cancer studies have been conducted on Afrezza in rats. The rats got a much higher inhalation dose than humans would take, and the researchers didn't find an increase in lung cancer. She said these types of studies weren't done on Exubera.\n\n\"They have done the required safety studies and come out clean, but it's only been tested for six months, so long-term isn't known,\" said Sanjoy Dutta, director of the insulin initiative at the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.\n\nDutta confirmed that Afrezza is fast-acting and less likely to cause low blood sugar. \"Just as quickly as it has an onset of action, it also has a quick off mechanism. It doesn't stay around long enough to cause hypoglycemia,\" he said.\n\nWhile Afrezza looks promising, it can't replace all injections for people with diabetes. Because it's fast-acting, it can't provide the long action of insulin known as basal insulin. It will only replace meal-time insulin.\n\nAfrezza may have an impact on lung function, but Leone-Bay said once people stopped taking Afrezza, this effect went away. The company is conducting clinical trials to assess Afrezza in people with asthma.\n\nLeone-Bay was to explain the Technosphere technology Tuesday at the American Chemical Society annual meeting in San Francisco. MannKind hopes the technology used in Afrezza might help deliver drugs that treat pain and osteoporosis, too.\n\nLearn more about both types of diabetes and treatments from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "One independent source was quoted, who pointed out that safety studies \"came out clean\" and that we don\u2019t have long-term safety data.

Without intervention, 80 to 90 percent of infants who are born to mothers infected with hepatitis B develop a chronic infection. The current standard of care is to provide vaccine and immune globulin to reduce transmission rates.\n\n\u201cPreventing mother-to-child transmission is the most effective way to reduce the global burden of chronic hepatitis B infection and liver cancer,\u201d says Calvin Pan, MD, lead author of the study and a clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone. \u201cWe believe that these findings will not only save many lives, but could also help to eradicate hepatitis B nationally and abroad.\u201d\n\nThe study was conducted in five locations in China, where HBV infection is endemic. Pan and colleagues enrolled 200 pregnant women with a high \u201cviral load,\u201d defined as one million copies of the virus per milliliter in a blood sample. Participants were randomly assigned to either a control group that received no antiviral therapy, or to a second group that received a daily dose of 300 milligrams of tenofovir in pill form, beginning at 30 or 32 weeks of pregnancy and continuing until 4 weeks after delivery.\n\nTreatment effectively reduced the viral load of the pregnant women, says Pan. Before delivery, 68 percent of tenofovir-treated mothers had HBV loads below 1 million copies per milliliter, compared to 2 percent of nontreated mothers.\n\nIn terms of safety, researchers found that tenofovir was well tolerated; only one participant treated with tenofovir voluntarily withdrew from the study due to nausea. Among the children born during the study, Pan and his colleagues found no significant differences between the tenofovir-treated group and the control group with regard to fetal development and infant growth.\n\n\u201cThis study provides strong evidence on how best to care for women infected with hepatitis B during pregnancy and reduce the rate of disease transmission,\u201d says Mark Pochapin, MD, the Sholtz/Leeds Professor of Gastroenterology and director of the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at NYU Langone.\n\nBased on the findings, the investigators recommend that women be tested for HBV viral load at week 28 of pregnancy. Those with a high viral load should receive tenofovir treatment starting at gestational week 30 until delivery to reduce the risk of transmission to their infants. In addition, infants should receive hepatitis B vaccine and immune globulin.

They have designed a \"granular jamming cap\" filled with coffee grounds that does a better job of tracking patient head movements than current methods. They are disclosing the novel design and data on its effectiveness at the International Conference on Information Processing in Computer-Assisted Interventions in Barcelona on June 20.\n\nOf course, the coffee grounds are not loose: they form a thin layer inside a stretchy silicone headpiece, which looks something like a black latex swim cap decorated with reflective dots. After the cap is placed on the patient's head, it is attached to a vacuum pump that sucks the air out of the cap, jamming the tiny grounds together to form a rigid layer that conforms closely to the shape of the patient's head. (This is the same effect that turns vacuum-packed coffee into solid bricks.)\n\nBefore surgery, a special scanner is used to map the location of the dots relative to key features on the patient's head: a process called registration. Then, during surgery an overhead camera observes the position of the dots allowing the navigation system to accurately track the position of the patient's head when the surgeon repositions it. The computer uses this information to combine a CT scan, which provides a detailed 3-D view of the bone and soft tissue hidden inside the patient's head, with the position of the instruments the surgeon is using and displays them together in real time on a monitor in the operating room.\n\n\"These are very delicate operations and a sophisticated image guidance system has been developed to help the surgeons, but they don't trust the system because sometimes it is spot on and other times it is off the mark,\" said Robert Webster, associate professor of mechanical engineering and otolaryngology, who is developing a surgical robot designed specifically for endonasal surgery. \"When we heard about this, we began wondering what was causing these errors and we decided to investigate.\"\n\nWhen Webster and his research team looked into the matter, they were surprised by what they found. They discovered it wasn't the hardware or the software in the guidance system that was causing the problem. It was the way the reflective markers were attached to the patient's head that was at fault. Typically, these \"fiducial markers\" are attached by an elastic headband and double-backed tape and are subject to jarring and slipping. Their tests found that skin movement and accidental bumps by operating room staff both produced large tracking errors.\n\n\"The basic assumption is that, after registration, the spatial relationships between the patient's head and the fiducial markers remains constant,\" said Patrick Wellborn, the graduate student who is making the presentation. \"Unfortunately, that is not the case. For one thing, studies have shown that the skin on a person's forehead can move as much as a half an inch relative to the skull. And accidentally bumping or dragging cables over the headband can also produce significant targeting errors.\"\n\nIn fact, previous research has found that when everything goes well, the guidance system produces targeting errors of about 2 millimeters but, in about one operation out of seven, the target error is much larger, forcing the surgeon to redo the registration process.\n\n\"Actually, we do have a solution to this problem but it involves drilling and attaching the markers directly to the skull...which we don't like to do because it is painful and it's a step backwards from the majority of what we are doing,\" said Assistant Professor of Otolaryngology Paul Russell, who is collaborating with the engineers on the project.\n\nSo the team began thinking up alternative, non-invasive methods to attach these critical markers. Webster recalled some experiments that were done using coffee grounds to help robots grip irregularly shaped objects. Bladders filled with coffee grounds were built into the robot's gripper. When it grabbed an object, the bladders conformed to its shape. Then a vacuum was pulled, the coffee grounds became rigid and locked the object into place. The researchers decided to see if this technique could be applied to the problem.\n\nIn the last three years, they have gone through a number of designs. They began with headbands that had coffee-ground-filled bags over the temples. Their tests showed that these models could reduce the targeting error by about 50 percent. But the engineers still weren't satisfied.\n\nThen, Wellborn, who was taking over the project, had a brainstorming session with fellow graduate student Richard Hendrick. Among the materials that his predecessor had left behind was a latex bald cap. \"That sparked the idea of caps in general,\" Wellborn recalled. \"We wanted something elastic that was form fitting, which led to the idea of a swim cap.\"\n\nIn addition to fitting extremely tightly to the head, the new design had another advantage. The headband system has only three fiducial markers attached on the ends of three thin rods to form a triangle. The new design allowed them to attach several dozen markers directly to the surface of the cap, which the researchers believe will also contribute to improving the guidance system's accuracy.\n\nThey designed three tests to determine how well this \"granular jamming cap\" performed relative to the current headband in reducing targeting error:\n\u2022 They \"bumped\" both them from a number of different directions with a tennis ball filled with plastic particles swinging on the end of a string. They found that the cap reduced targeting errors by 83 percent.\n\u2022 They simulated the case where a cable or other piece of equipment is accidentally pushed against the two by applying forces ranging from four to six pounds in different directions. They determined that the cap outperformed the headband by 76 percent when the forces were applied to the headband and by 92 percent when they were applied to the markers.\n\u2022 They tested the effects of head repositioning by having an experienced surgeon reposition test subjects' heads six to seven times. In this case, the cap proved to have 66 percent lower error rates than the headband.\n\nOn the strength of these results, Vanderbilt University has applied for a patent on the design and the technology is available for licensing. (Interested parties should contact the Vanderbilt Center for Technology Transfer and Commercialization.)\n\n\"It's a very clever way--that doesn't involve drilling holes in patients' skulls--to greatly improve the accuracy of the guidance system when we are operating in the middle of a person's skull: a zone where the accuracy of the current system is inadequate,\" said Russell.\n\nStudy coauthors also include graduate student Neal Dillon and former postdoctoral fellows Jessica Burgner, professor engineering at Leibniz University in Hanover, Germany, Ray Lathrop, senior consultant engineer at Eli Lilly and Company, and Raul Wirz, medical imaging processing research scientist/engineer at Vanderbilt University Medical Center,\n\nThe research was supported by National Institutes of Health grant R01 EB017467 and National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship grant 144519.", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The news release says the research was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.

One expert, Dr. Dale Bredesen, a professor at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and a professor at the Easton Laboratories for Neurodegenerative Disease Research at UCLA, thinks he might have found a way to reverse memory loss, a hallmark of the disease.\n\nIn a study published in the journal Aging, Bredesen and colleagues showed how 10 patients who were experiencing age-related memory decline showed brain scan improvements after following an approach called metabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration (MEND), a 36-point individualized regimen of diet, exercise, brain stimulation, sleep improvements, medication and vitamins and other specific protocols for five to 24 months.\n\nFor example, an MRI of one patient showed hippocampal volume at the 17th percentile for his age range prior to MEND. (The hippocampus is a brain area critical for learning and memory that shrinks in Alzheimer's patients.) After 10 months of following the prescribed protocol, his hippocampal volume increased to the 75th percentile.\n\nThe study noted that some of the patients who had to quit working as a result of their memory decline, were able to return to work after adopting MEND and participants who were struggling at their jobs reported an improvement in job performance.\n\n\"Lives have been dramatically impacted,\" Bredesen told CBS News. \"I'm enthusiastic about that and continue to evolve the protocol.\"\n\nJames E. Galvin, M.D., M.P.H., a professor of clinical biomedical science at FAU's Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine and a professor in the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing, who was not involved in the study, agreed that personalized approaches such as the MEND protocol are the types of approaches needed for this disease going forward. \"It's important to be excited about this approach,\" he told CBS News. However, Galvin cautioned, \"I'm not sure about the method.\"\n\nThe MEND protocol, outlined in a 2014 study in the journal Aging, calls for interventions to treat conditions that could be associated with Alzheimer's such as inflammation, stress and diabetes. However, MEND also requires the use of supplements which are not well studied and do not require FDA approval.\n\n\"Not all things from the approach have a lot of scientific support behind them,\" Galvin told CBS News.\n\nBut Bredesen believes that the only way to treat Alzheimer's is to treat all of the underlying problems, which may require intervention with supplements. \"Nutrition, exercise, sleep, stress reduction -- these are all critical pieces of this,\" he told CBS News. \"It's about optimizing biochemistry for your genetics, whatever it takes.\"\n\nBut even if MEND is effective, the program is complex and difficult to follow. A Buck Institute press release on the study stated: \"None of the patients were able to stick to the entire protocol. The significant diet and lifestyle changes, and multiple pills required each day, were the two most common complaints.\"\n\nBredesen said that to simplify the program, they are connecting patients with health coaches. \"We're trying to make it simpler, but we don't want to lose the efficacy,\" he said.\n\nBredesen noted, too, that the MEND protocol was suitable for patients in the early stages of Alzheimer's. One participant from the 2014 study, who had been diagnosed with late-stage Alzheimer's, did not show improvements with the protocol.\n\n\"If you told me that your mother is 86 and living in a home, I would say that I'd want to treat you,\" he said. \"It's about prevention.\"\n\nBredesen said that his team has a couple of larger trials planned to confirm or refute the results in the current study and to address key questions about how long results can be maintained and how late in the course of cognitive decline reversal is possible.\n\nGalvin agrees that more research is necessary before any conclusive results can be reported. \"This is moving in the right direction,\" he told CBS News. \"These anecdotal case reports provide a nice point to start a discussion.\"", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story does include an independent source, Florida Atlantic University professor James E.

When she was discharged on weekends, to spend time with her then-boyfriend Aaron, she had to rely on him for her every need. He'd cut her food into bite-size pieces, and bathe and dress her. When she lost control of her bladder or bowel, he'd help her go to the bathroom.\n\n\"I had no feeling from the chest down,\" Molson says. \"I could touch something boiling on the stove and burn myself. I could touch fabric without knowing whether it's sandpaper.\" For patients like Molson, with a severe form of MS and no response to the available medications, there\u2019s little hope.\n\nTwo years later, her life had taken an abrupt turn. \"I walked down the aisle and danced at my wedding, something I had always dreamed of doing,\" she said of her marriage to Aaron in 2003.\n\nNow, 15 years later, Molson is still skiing and kayaking on the weekends. She works as a research assistant at Ottawa Hospital.\n\nWhat happened is something even esteemed medical specialists are venturing to call a \"miracle\": The particularly aggressive MS that was on track to disable Molson entirely \u2014 and potentially kill her \u2014 is now virtually eliminated from her body.\n\nThe game changer for Molson was an experimental chemotherapy and stem cell bone marrow transplant she got in 2002 as part of a study in Canada. Molson was one of a small cohort of 24 people with MS who received the high-risk therapy. Of the 24 patients, 70 percent saw the progression of their disease halted or reversed.\n\nTheir experience, documented in a paper published today in the Lancet, is the first to describe any MS treatment that fully stops the disease over the long term without MS medication.\n\n\"Everyone is hesitating to use the 'c word,' but these patients are cured,\" says Michael Rudnicki, director of the Regenerative Medicine Program and the Sprott Centre for Stem Cell Research at the Ottawa Health Research Institute, who was not involved with the research. \"Jennifer Molson was in a wheelchair in a rehab center unable to work.

People with \"relapsing remitting\" disease experience MS in fits and starts \u2014 their symptoms show up for a few days or weeks, followed by weeks, months, or even years of remission.\n\nFor most patients with this version of the disease, those periods of remission get smaller over time and eventually disappear, moving them into a new phase of disease known as \"secondary progressive MS.\"\n\nOther patients experience something even more insidious and grinding. It's called \"primary progressive MS,\" and instead of bouts of remission they see a continuous increase in symptoms accompanied by a decline in health.\n\nMolson had secondary progressive MS at the time of her treatment in 2002. She had tried medication, and nothing worked.\n\nHer doctor, Mark Freedman (one of the authors on the Lancet paper), told her the stem cell transplant wasn't going to cure her, but at best, if the procedure went well, her health wouldn't worsen.\n\n\"My greatest hope was that the disease would stabilize,\" Molson says. \"I looked at Aaron, [now] my husband, and said, 'If I don't do this, and it proves to work, I'd be kicking myself if my disease progressed.' It felt like I really didn't have a choice.\"\n\nOnce she was accepted into the study, doctors began the procedure. They first put her through a short course of chemotherapy to stimulate the production of hematopoietic stem cells, which regenerate the immune system, in her blood. They then hooked her up to a machine that cycled through her blood 32 times over the course of seven hours, in order to collect stem cells. Those stem cells were then purified, wiped of any memory of the disease, to later be transplanted into Molson through a blood transfusion.\n\nThe most trying part of the treatment: Molson had to endure 10 days of chemotherapy. The doctors were essentially killing off her diseased immune system, only to later replace it with a new one in the form of her own purified stem cells. But the experience was grueling. Molson likened it to \"hell.\"\n\n\"I had a feeding tube because I was constantly nauseous,\" she says. \"I couldn't keep my food down.\"\n\nGrowing a new, disease-free immune system meant Molson's body had to relearn how to defend itself from disease-causing bacteria and viruses. She had to get her childhood vaccines again. But she was also more vulnerable to infection, and wound up developing a blood infection, shingles, and serious bladder infections shortly after the transplant.\n\n\"It took me at least a year before I started to feel human again,\" Molson says.\n\nAround a year and half after the transplant, she began to slowly return to some likeness of her pre-MS self: She was walking without using a cane, she could shop in the grocery store again, and eventually she didn't need to nap every afternoon.\n\n\"I thought, Maybe I can go back to work,\" she says. By 2006, four years after her treatment, she returned to work full time. (She chose to work at the Ottawa Hospital, she said, after seeing firsthand how research can change people's lives.)\n\nMolson, now 41, says, \"I haven't had any MS symptoms in 14 years. And I'm not on any MS medications.\" That's a big deal given that the medications usually involve daily pills or frequent injections.\n\nBut treatment has also left her several unpleasant side effects. Because the chemotherapy damaged her ovaries and put her into early menopause, she's on hormone replacement therapy \u2014 and wouldn't be able to get pregnant. While she was given the chance to harvest her eggs, she declined. \"I couldn't look after myself, how could I raise children?,\" she says. \"Remember, I wasn't supposed to get better.\"\n\nShe also has to be extra cautious about any exposure to infections. \"I was at the dentist three weeks ago, and I had to be on antibiotics before I went for a teeth cleaning,\" she says. \"There are still parts of the immune system that you have to be careful about.\"\n\nMolson's hair never fully grew back, and she also contends with daily heartburn and digestive issues, which she takes medications for.\n\nOtherwise, Molson says she feels as good as she did when she was 21, before her diagnosis. \"I don't take anything for granted. I got a second chance at life.\"\n\nOnly 5 percent of MS patients will be eligible for this new treatment\n\nThe study that gave Molson this chance was impressive in its scope and its execution \u2014 conducted at multiple hospitals by hematologists and neurologists in Canada and lasting nearly 20 years, from conception to publication. It built on decades of basic research about MS, stem cells, and the immune system, including years of experience using the treatment in patients with blood and bone marrow cancers like leukemia and lymphoma.\n\nOther scientists have already seen promising results in MS patients using similar treatment protocols, but none have managed what Atkins's team has: to completely halt the disease's attack on the brain \u2014no relapses, no new MRI lesions in all surviving patients \u2014 and for such a long follow-up period.\n\nSeveral researchers who were not involved with the experiment \u2014 and who typically are reserved about novel treatments \u2014 told Vox they were excited and hopeful for the treatment's potential to benefit others with the disease.\n\n\"I think this is going to be the new standard of care for progressive MS,\" said Rudnicki.\n\n\"It\u2019s exciting \u2014 an important proof of principle,\" said Jeffrey Gelfand, a neurologist specializing in MS at the University of California San Francisco.\n\nTim Caulfield, a University of Alberta professor who has been tracking stem cell research, noted the difference between this robust finding and the unfounded claims in stem cell clinics around the world: \"This is a fascinating development \u2026 [and] a good example of the difference between the real clinical research and what is being marketed by the clinics providing unproven therapies \u2014 you can't simply \u2018inject\u2019 stem cells and expect significant results.\"\n\nStill, there are major caveats to consider. This study was small and lacked a comparison or control arm. Similar, larger studies are needed to confirm the results, and it's not clear what will happen to patients like Molson in the much longer term.\n\nOttawa Hospital hematologist Harry Atkins, the researcher who led the study, pointed out that only about 5 percent of MS patients would be eligible for this treatment: again, the minority who have an aggressive form of MS that's not responding to any treatment.\n\nAnd not everyone in the study had results like Molson's. Of the 24 patients, 70 percent saw the progression of their disease halt or reverse, but the other 30 percent continued to worsen.\n\nThat minority who didn\u2019t respond, the researchers think, had MS that was already too far along by the time of their treatment. \"At early stages, once the immune system quiets down, the brain can partially heal itself, so the disability tends to get better,\" Atkins explained. \"But as time goes on, the brain can't repair itself.\"\n\nOne patient died, which puts the potential for death from this procedure at around 4 percent, and severe infections after stem cell treatments \u2014 the kind Molson picked up, or worse \u2014 are also common.\n\nSince there are other MS medications that are much less toxic and can help some patients, doctors only recommend considering this therapy as a last resort. (Theoretically, the treatment could be done in most blood and marrow transplant centers associated with major hospitals, Atkins said, but there are only a few that perform the procedure. Interested patients can contact the MS Society for more information.)\n\nThere's also the cost: Atkins put it at about $50,000 to $65,000 per patient \u2014 and that's if nothing goes wrong. (Although, MS medications now cost about as much for patients every year in the US so this therapy could actually be a money saver.)\n\nAnd there are questions about the very long-term effects. It\u2019s not clear what the next 10, 20, or 50 years look like for patients like Molson.\n\n\"We know in the long term survivors from groups that have their transplants for cancer and they're cured and they live a long time,\" Atkins said, \"that they have a higher incidence of the general population of other diseases [such as heart disease and cancers].\"\n\nAlready, Atkins and his team have been working on other applications for this stem cell procedure. They managed to reverse \"stiff-person syndrome\" \u2014 a rare neurological disease that causes the muscles in the body contract to the point of complete immobilization \u2014 in one patient. And there\u2019s talk of applying the treatment to myasthenia gravis, another incurable autoimmune disease.\n\nCures in medicine are extremely rare. It's still too early to label this treatment a cure for MS. \"We have only followed our patients for up to 13 years,\" Atkins said, \"so it\u2019s hard to say what the next 10 to 20 will bring. You\u2019d want to know that before you'd call this a cure.\"\n\nFor now, though, Atkins will use the word miracle. \"It still appears like a miracle to me to see patients recover, and get back to the things that they were supposed to do in life,\" he said. \"It is very rewarding to see and it wasn't what we expected, and we are overjoyed about it to know this treatment can help people in that way.\"\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article misstated the worldwide prevalence of MS.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Yes, and the independent sources were very helpful.

This method, this test, needs to be tried [and confirmed] with many more subjects outside our laboratory,\" he says. Plus, the research needs to be expanded to many more study participants and tried on younger people with autism and those who are not as high-functioning as the subjects in this first trial.\n\nUsing the MRI, the study authors measured how the water in the brain flows along the axons or nerve fibers in the parts of the brain that control language, social and emotional functioning. The scans revealed that the wiring of the brains of those with autism was disorganized compared with the brains of a typical person without autism. This is how they could determine which brains scans belonged those study participants with autism.\n\nThe study included only males between the ages of 7 and 28 because they were part of a bigger research project at the University of Utah, which is following males with autism for a longer period. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 1 in 110 children in the United States have an autism spectrum disorder and boys are far more likely to have this neurological disorder that affects language and social behavior \u2013 that number is about 1 in 70. However future studies will include girls too.\n\nCurrently there's no biologic test for autism, so pediatricians look to see if a child is meeting certain developmental milestones as well as signs and symptoms of autism. (The advocacy group Autism Speaks has posted videos to help parents see the signs of autism)\n\nThe earlier a child has been identified as having autism, the earlier behavioral therapies can be applied to lessen the impact of the disorder later in life. Lange believes this brain scans can be done on younger children, as long as they can go to sleep in the scanner \u2013 on their own, without sedation (because you can't move during the test).\n\nCarissa Cascio, an assistant professor of psychiatry from Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, who specializes in autism and neuro-imaging, believes these study results are important.

Now, a small pilot study suggests such a test could be developed.\n\nThe study, of 78 people with and without colon cancer, found that those with the disease tended to have a distinct pattern of chemicals in their breath. And when researchers analyzed the study participants' breath samples, they correctly identified the colon cancer patients 76 percent of the time.\n\nThe findings, reported online Dec. 5 in the British Journal of Surgery, sound good. But if you're waiting for your doctor to offer such a test, don't hold your breath.\n\n\"It's an interesting concept, but this is in the very early stages,\" said Dr. Durado Brooks, director of prostate and colorectal cancers for the American Cancer Society.\n\n\"There's no way to tell if this would work in the general population,\" said Brooks, who was not involved in the research.\n\nWhat's more, he added, there are already several good ways to catch colon cancer -- or, even better, precancerous growths called polyps, which can then be removed before a tumor develops. Yet about 40 percent of Americans who should be getting screened are not.\n\n\"Colon cancer is a highly preventable disease,\" Brooks said. \"And I would encourage the four out of 10 people who are not taking advantage of the existing screening tools to talk with their doctor.\"\n\nThe idea of using a breath test to catch cancer is not new: Researchers are looking into breath tests for detecting a number of cancers, including lung and breast tumors. It's all based on studies showing that breath samples from cancer patients tend to have a distinguishing pattern of so-called volatile organic compounds (VOCs).\n\nWhen it comes to colon cancer, people already have several options for screening, which for most adults should begin at age 50 -- or possibly earlier if you are at higher-than-normal risk.\n\nThe choices include a yearly stool test that looks for hidden blood, or either of two invasive tests that scope the colon: sigmoidoscopy every five years, along with stool testing every three years; or colonoscopy every 10 years.\n\nBut many people are turned off by those tests.\n\nSo Dr. Donato Altomare and colleagues at the University Aldo Moro in Bari, Italy, decided to test the feasibility of a breath test.\n\nAnalyzing breath samples from 37 patients with colon cancer and 41 healthy middle-aged adults, the researchers found 15 VOCs that seemed to differ between the two groups.\n\nThey then used a statistical model to see if certain VOC patterns separated the colon cancer patients from the healthy participants. In the end, the researchers were able to correctly identify the cancer patients 76 percent of the time.\n\nBut, Brooks pointed out, that also means the breath test was wrong about one-quarter of the time.\n\nThere's no way of knowing how well such a screening test would work in the real world -- including how many people might wrongly get a positive result and undergo needless invasive tests to follow up, Brooks said.\n\nAnother big question, he added, is whether breath analysis could pinpoint people with colon polyps.\n\n\"One of our goals in screening is to detect polyps, not cancer,\" Brooks said. \"This study doesn't address that.\"\n\nAltomare's team acknowledges that there is a lot of work left to do. It's still unclear which breath chemicals should be measured, or what statistical method is best for weeding out cases of colon cancer.\n\nBrooks said it would be nice to have a very simple, accurate screening test -- whether that means a breath test or blood or urine tests. Yearly stool tests are simple and cheap, but people often don't want to do them.\n\n\"We're always searching for simpler things to do,\" Brooks said. But for now, he added, \"this study raises many more questions than answers.\"\n\nLearn more about colon cancer from the U.S. National Cancer Institute.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "An expert from the American Cancer Society\u00a0provides much-needed context and perspective on this research.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "If authenticated in further, larger trials, the results could also become a landmark in the field of autism research, since scientists speculated that the drug may help some patients with autism not caused by fragile X, perhaps becoming the first medicine to address autism\u2019s core symptoms.\n\nOne child in five thousand is born with fragile X syndrome, with mental effects ranging from mild learning disabilities to retardation so profound that sufferers do not speak, and physical effects that include elongated faces, prominent jaws, big ears, and enlarged testes. It mostly affects boys and earned its name because, under a microscope, one arm of the X chromosome seems nearly broken, with part hanging by a thread.\n\nThe gene for fragile X was discovered in 1991. Work since then has found that fragile X patients seem to experience an overload of unchecked synaptic noise \u2014 synapses being the junctions between brain neurons. The Novartis drug and others like it are intended to lower the volume of this noise so memory formation and high-level thinking can take place, allowing children to develop normally.\n\nThe Novartis trial, which began in 2008 in Europe with data analysis completed this year, was too brief to observe effects on basic intelligence. Instead, researchers measured a range of aberrant behaviors like hyperactivity, repetitive motions, social withdrawal and inappropriate speech. They gave one set of patients the drug and another a placebo, and after a few weeks switched treatments, with both doctors and patients unaware of which pill was which.\n\nThe results of the trial were something of a jumble until Novartis scientists noticed that patients who had a particular, undisclosed biological trait improved far more than others. \u201cThe bottom line is that we showed clear improvements in behavior,\u201d Dr. Fishman said.\n\nTold of the results, two parents of a fragile X patient were euphoric.\n\n\u201cThis is what we have been working for and hoping for since our son was diagnosed with fragile X 17 years ago,\u201d said Katie Clapp, president and co-founder of the Fraxa Research Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to financing fragile X research. \u201cThis may be the key to solving the mystery of autism and other developmental disorders.\u201d\n\nGeraldine Dawson, chief science officer at Autism Speaks, the world\u2019s largest autism advocacy organization, said that a growing body of research suggests that the many genetic causes of autism all seem to affect synapses, suggesting that a treatment for one form of the disease might help others.\n\n\u201cThe exciting thing about these results is that it is our hope that these same medications may have similar positive benefits for people with autism who don\u2019t have fragile X syndrome,\u201d Dr. Dawson said.\n\nBetween 10 percent and 15 percent of autism cases result from fragile X syndrome or some other known genetic defect. While fragile X is the most common inherited cause of mental retardation, Down syndrome \u2014 which also causes retardation \u2014 is more common but is not inherited.\n\nThe Novartis trial results were not published or peer reviewed, and for commercial reasons Dr. Fishman refused to divulge many details. Dr. Luca Santarelli, head of neuroscience at Roche, confirmed that Roche is in the midst of testing a similar medicine in fragile X patients at four sites in the United States.\n\n\u201cSo far we like what we see,\u201d Dr. Santarelli said in his only characterization of their study.\n\nOne reason for the euphoria surrounding the Novartis trial is that it was seen as an especially difficult test of the drug\u2019s effects. For ethical reasons, Novartis tested the drug only in adults. But the company and outside researchers believe that such compounds may prove most effective in young children, whose brains are far more likely to respond rapidly when barriers to learning are removed.\n\n\u201cThis is perhaps the most promising therapeutic discovery ever for a gene-based behavioral disease,\u201d said Dr. Edward M. Scolnick, former research chief at Merck and now director of the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nDr. Scolnick has not seen the results of the Novartis trial, but was told of them and concluded that if the drugs work in fragile X, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing to say that they won\u2019t work in some cases of broader autism-spectrum disorders.\u201d\n\nThe roots for the Novartis results began in 1982 when Stephen T. Warren, then a graduate student in genetics at Michigan State University, was looking for a job and something to research. A friend told him about fragile X and, with the same reflection he might use to pick a novel for a long flight, he decided that he wanted to find the gene that caused it.\n\n\u201cI had no idea how hard this would be,\u201d Dr. Warren said. Nine years later, Dr. Warren, then at Emory University, was part of an international team that won a fierce competition by isolating the gene. The discovery was front-page news around the world, and experts predicted that widespread fetal testing and therapies were in the offing.\n\nThe predictions were premature because, like most of genetic research, discovering how the flawed gene caused disease was far harder than anticipated and required multiple leaps in neurology and biology. And even with those, much remains mysterious.\n\nFragile X is caused by a genetic stutter in which a portion of the gene gets repeated like a scratched album. With each subsequent generation, the number of repeats tends to rise. So if a mother has 10 repeats, her child might have 11 or 12. For reasons that are not well understood, however, this process of repeat amplification can suddenly go haywire. So mothers who have 55 or more repeats tend to have children with hundreds.\n\nIn anyone with 200 or more repeats, the body shuts off the gene. Since genes are used to make proteins, this genetic silencing means the encoded protein is never made. The absence of this protein in cells causes the wide-ranging effects of fragile X syndrome. Those with 55 to 200 repeats are considered carriers, and recent research shows they can have severe neurological declines late in life that mimic Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s.\n\nMany geneticists would have moved on to other research topics after finding a disorder\u2019s underlying gene. But Dr. Warren met affected children and their parents. Instead of family pictures, Dr. Warren\u2019s desk displays a framed photo of a fragile X chromosome.\n\n\u201cI could not imagine telling someone like Katie Clapp that we were not going to pursue this research anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nSo he kept on. Years of work by him and others found that the protein missing in those with fragile X normally seems to act as a sort of traffic cop at brain synapses, helping to stop or slow brain signaling at crucial intervals. It does this by sopping up the genetic instructions needed to produce proteins that encourage brain signaling. Regulating this flow of electronic pulses across the brain is crucial for the brain\u2019s ability to learn and mature.\n\nDr. Warren was puzzling over how to recreate that synaptic traffic cop when, because of a scheduling conflict, he showed up in 2001 at the wrong scientific conference and happened to sit next to Mark F. Bear, a neuroscience professor at M.I.T. who had just given a presentation about compounds that seemed to work in synapses to speed the creation of proteins \u2014 including the one missing in fragile X patients.\n\nThe two got to talking and decided to collaborate. They found that if Dr. Bear reverse-engineered his compounds, they seemed to slow brain transmissions. Instead of a traffic cop, the brain would get speed bumps. Not ideal, but perhaps adequate in lowering the synaptic noise enough to encourage learning and the moderation of the kind of synaptic traffic jams that in fragile X children can lead to seizures.\n\nSure enough, mice, fish and fruit flies that through genetic engineering were made to have fragile X seemed to become normal when given Dr. Bear\u2019s compound. The Novartis compound is a member of the same drug family.\n\n\u201cWe have been promising for a long time that unlocking the molecular basis for hereditary diseases would lead to dramatic therapeutic advances, and that promise is finally coming true,\u201d said Dr. Francis S. Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, in discussing the science leading up to the trial. \u201cBut it has not been easy.\u201d\n\nA hundred years ago, Katie Clapp would have died giving birth to Andy, her child with fragile X.\n\n\u201cAndy\u2019s head was too big to get out without a C-section, he would have killed me, and that would have taken care of the fragile X gene,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Ms. Clapp and Andy did survive. And despite going to some of the best hospitals in the country, four years would pass before Andy\u2019s condition was properly diagnosed.\n\nWhen a doctor finally thought to do a fragile X test, Ms. Clapp and her husband, Dr. Michael Tranfaglia \u2014 both Harvard graduates with post-graduate degrees \u2014 researched the disease and came to two conclusions: fragile X was potentially treatable; and only about five researchers in the world were working toward a cure.\n\n\u201cAnd I thought, what if all five walk across the street at the same time and get hit by a Mack truck?\u201d Ms. Clapp said. \u201cThat is not going to get us there.\u201d\n\nSo the two started the Fraxa Research Foundation. Remarkably, their efforts seem to be paying off and may finally offer hope not only to those who with fragile X but to carriers like Andy\u2019s sister, Laura.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always known my kids have a chance of having it,\u201d Laura, 18, said in a recent visit to the family\u2019s house. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to have kids for at least 10 years anyway, and they\u2019ll have a cure for by then.\u201d\n\nShe paused, looked at her mother and said: \u201cYou\u2019ve got 10 years.\u201d", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "While the story does collect feedback from a number of independent expert sources, we think the way these sources were used was inappropriate and potentially misleading.

The report greatly expands the universe of people who should be screened to see if they need the medication to everyone over age 40 regardless of whether they have a history of cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe recommendations also support the position of the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, which in 2013 radically shifted their advice from suggesting that doctors focus on the level of a patient\u2019s low-density lipoproteins (LDL) or \u201cbad cholesterol\u201d to looking at a more comprehensive picture of risk based on things such as weight and blood pressure, as well as lifestyle factors.\n\n\u201cPeople with no signs, symptoms, or history of cardiovascular disease can still be at risk for having a heart attack or stroke,\u201d said Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, who chairs the task force.\n\n[Could these new cholesterol drugs save many people from heart attacks?]\n\nThe task force, which is made up of independent experts but commissioned by the government, concurred after a comprehensive review of the evidence on the topic determined that a broader evaluation of risk is needed. But it puts a greater emphasis on age than the ACC and AHA did in determining who might benefit from the medication in preventing heart attack or stroke. It is also slightly more conservative when it comes to determining the benefits of taking the medications, which include Lipitor, Crestor and Zocor.\n\nThe new guidelines, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, suggests that people ages 40 to 75 who have one or more risk factors \u2014 such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes or smoking that put them at a 10 percent or greater risk of having a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years \u2014 should be on statins. The group also said that people with a 7.5 percent to 10 percent risk \u201cmay also benefit\u201d but did not definitively recommend they take them. \u201cPeople in this group should make an individual decision with their doctor about whether to start taking statins,\u201d the task force advised.\n\nIn contrast, the ACC and AHA recommend that people with a 7.5 percent or greater risk take the drugs.\n\n[Who should take statins? A vicious debate over cholesterol drugs.]\n\nAnother important difference between the groups is that the task force withheld a recommendation about starting statins in adults who are 76 and older, saying that \u201cthe current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms.\u201d In a commentary accompanying the recommendations, Philip Greenland and Robert Bonow note that there is \u201cuncertainty and hesitation\u201d in the guidelines regarding older people but said it appears that it is not necessary to stop taking statins at age 76 if you are already on them.\n\nThe task force and AHA groups carry tremendous influence in medical practice and in what insurance companies will cover. Medicare typically follows USPSTF guidelines in determining coverage and the Affordable Care Act specifies that USPSTF recommendations rated at the strongest levels must be used as a floor for coverage for private insurers. In the case of statins, this would apply to the use of the drug by those who are 40 to 75 years old with one or more risk factors for cardiovascular disease and who have a 10 percent or greater risk \u2014 but not those with 7.5 to 10 percent risk.\n\nIndividual doctors are free to take the advice or leave it, and in recent months there has been a lot of debate about what the scientific evidence really shows regarding the therapy.\n\nThere is a consensus among experts that people at substantial risk for heart disease benefit from statins but considerable disagreement about those at lower risk. Last month, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins wrote in the journal Lancet that \u201cit\u2019s a force for good.\u201d But Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California at San Francisco and editor of JAMA Internal Medicine, and others have been vocal about their belief that the drugs are overprescribed and that the side effects \u2014 which range from muscle pain and cataracts to possibly an increased risk for diabetes in women \u2014 should be taken more seriously.\n\nIn an opinion piece Sunday, Redberg and Mitchell Katz, deputy editor of JAMA Internal Medicine, advised everyone to take \u201ca step back\u201d and ask \u201cwhy this debate is so contentious.\u201d They suggest that the estimates of the benefits of statins may be inflated, that the drugs as an intervention are \u201cweak,\u201d and that the reports of adverse events are incomplete.\n\n\u201cIn deciding on any therapy, it is important to understand the risks and benefits, particularly for healthy people,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe two U.S. guidelines are notably more aggressive in recommending drugs than reports issued by their counterparts in other parts of the world, including the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (which recommends statins in men 40 and older but only after age 50 in women, and the U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which recommends discussing lifestyle modification before offering statin therapy). The European Society of Cardiology focuses more on managing LDL.\n\nStatins are among the best-selling drugs in the United States, with a 2011 study showing at least 32 million Americans were taking them.

Results of the study were published today (Dec. 17, 2018) in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nMeasuring less than 1 centimeter across, or about a third of the area of a U.S. penny, the tiny devices -- which are safe for use in the body and implantable via a minimally invasive procedure -- generate gentle electric pulses from the stomach's natural churning motions and deliver them to the vagus nerve, which links the brain and the stomach.\n\nThat gentle stimulation dupes the brain into thinking that the stomach is full after only a few nibbles of food.\n\n\"The pulses correlate with the stomach's motions, enhancing a natural response to help control food intake,\" says Xudong Wang, a UW-Madison professor of materials science and engineering.\n\nUnlike gastric bypass, which permanently alters the capacity of the stomach, the effects of the new devices also are reversible. When Wang and his collaborators removed the devices after 12 weeks, the study's rats resumed their normal eating patterns and weight bounced right back on.\n\nWang's device has several advantages over an existing unit that stimulates the vagus nerve for weight loss. That existing unit, \"Maestro,\" approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2015, administers high-frequency zaps to the vagus nerve to shut down all communication between the brain and stomach. It requires a complicated control unit and bulky batteries which frequently must be recharged.\n\nThat ongoing maintenance can be a big barrier to use, says Luke Funk, a surgery professor in UW-Madison's Division of Minimally Invasive, Foregut and Bariatric Surgery. \"One potential advantage of the new device over existing vagus nerve stimulators is that it does not require external battery charging, which is a significant advantage when you consider the inconvenience that patients experience when having to charge a battery multiple times a week for an hour or so.\"\n\nIn fact, Wang's device contains no batteries, no electronics, and no complicated wiring. It relies instead on the undulations of the stomach walls to power its internal generators.\n\nThat means the device only stimulates the vagus nerve when the stomach moves.\n\n\"It's automatically responsive to our body function, producing stimulation when needed,\" says Wang. \"Our body knows best.\"\n\nWang is a world expert in wearable and implantable capacitive electricity-generating devices, having previously created implantable nanogenerators that harvest energy from people's beating hearts and breathing, a motion-powered bandage for wound healing, and other such devices.\n\nHe and his collaborators patented the weight-loss device through the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and are moving forward with testing in larger animal models.

But researchers say it can also improve vision in people with DME, a common form of diabetic retinopathy.\n\nThe study of 691 patients with DME found that 50 percent of those who received Lucentis eye injections, plus laser treatment if necessary, had substantial improvement in vision one year after treatment, compared with 28 percent of patients who received laser treatment alone. Results were similar after two years.\n\nFor 25 years, laser treatment has been the standard of care for DME, the main cause of vision loss in people with diabetes.\n\nThe study, published online in the journal Ophthalmology, was conducted by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research (DRCR) Network.\n\nAccording to the U.S. National Eye Institute, DME occurs when fluid leaks into the center of the macula, the portion of the eye dedicated to sharp, straight-ahead vision.

First responders asked Reisch to smile and immediately recognized his drooping mouth as a sign of a stroke. At the hospital, the first-line therapy, a powerful blood-thinning medication called tissue plasminogen activator or tPA could not dissolve the blood clots in Reisch\u2019s brain.\n\nSo the doctors at the Comprehensive Stroke Center at the University of California San Diego tried an innovative approach called a stent retriever.\n\nStent retriever therapy essentially captures the clot and pulls it out of the brain. A catheter is placed into a blood vessel in the groin and guided up into the brain through the blocked artery. Then a wire mesh opens, grabbing onto and removing the blood clot while the patient is still having a stroke.\n\nRelated: New Recommendations Say More Americans Should Take Aspirin\n\nFor Reisch, the impact was almost immediate: he began to regain feeling while undergoing the procedure.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re awake through the whole process and actually the doctors are telling you what to do,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cShortly after that he told me I could relax and that I did a good job and they had retrieved the clot and just to relax and I immediately started trying to move my arm.\u201d\n\n\u201cA patient will come in, they can't speak, they can't move half their body,\u201d says neurosurgeon Dr. J Mocco, of Mt.

In April, the journal Radiology published findings that highlight the added importance of removing clots in a timely manner. Researchers examined data on patients treated with both tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the standard in stroke treatment, and stent retrievers and found that restoration of blood flow within 2.5 hours of stroke onset was associated with minimal or no disability in 91 percent of patients.\n\nRoughly 795,000 people suffer a stroke every year in the United States, and it\u2019s the fifth highest cause of death and a leading cause of adult disability, according to the American Heart Association.\n\nFor more than 20 years, an injection of tPA, which dissolves the clot and improves blood flow to the affected part of the brain, has been the standard care for stroke patients. The intravenous drug is very effective for smaller clots, but it often fails to break up larger clots and is usually most effective when given within 4.5 hours after the first symptoms.\n\n\u201cThe earlier that patients with acute ischemic stroke get to a hospital offering the appropriate treatment, the higher the likelihood is of a good outcome,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Mayank Goyal of the Hotchkiss Brain Institute at the University of Calgary.\n\nCurrently, stent retriever therapy is offered in just a few hundred hospitals across the country, including more than 100 Comprehensive Stroke Centers accredited by the American Heart Association and The Joint Commission.\n\nThe new research provides more evidence of the need for new regional centers of care, in order to minimize the time it takes to transport a patient to hospital capable of providing stent therapy, according to Dr. William J.

It's potentially huge.\"\n\n\"This is something we've been waiting to see,\" he continued.\n\n\"This directly interferes with the genetic mechanisms that promote cancer to stop the production of a particular protein,\" added Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. \"This is one step away from getting into the actual DNA.\"\n\nAs reported online March 21 in Nature, this is the first time the process, known as RNA interference (RNAi), has been shown to work in humans.\n\nThe process of RNA interference involves putting two strands of RNA together to form so-called \"small interfering RNAs\" (siRNAs) and inserting them into cells. Once there, these interlopers cut the messenger RNA (mRNA) that is ordinarily used to make specific proteins. This discovery won the Nobel Prize in 2006.\n\nBut the work that nabbed the prize was done in worms -- a far cry from humans.\n\nAnd there were other challenges, not the least of which was how to get the siRNAs into the appropriate cell and then make sure they did what they were supposed to do.\n\nThis team, from the California Institute of Technology (CalTech), devised a super-small nanoparticle system that, when injected into the body, would make its way to the tumor, deposit the siRNAs into the tumor cell and leave them to their assigned task.\n\nThis early-phase clinical trial involved actual patients with melanoma, a particularly virulent form of skin cancer.\n\nThe experiment proceeded just as planned, as biopsies later showed.\n\nThe researchers injected the cargo-laden nanoparticles into the patients, much as you would administer a flu or any other type of shot. They did not inject directly into the tumor as many other researchers have done.\n\nThe nanoparticles made their way smoothly to the target -- the tumor cell -- and cleaved the mRNA in just the right place, stopping production of the culprit protein.\n\nThe precision of the process is crucial to limiting side effects, the researchers said.\n\n\"Now you can go selectively at proteins involved in the disease and not have off-target effects,\" explained Mark E. Davis, lead author of the paper, and professor of chemical engineering at CalTech in Pasadena. \"Normally when you make drugs, it's hard to say 'attack only that protein.' In this particular case, I'm going to go in at the genetic level and eliminate that one protein I want to eliminate.\"\n\nAnd unlike conventional gene therapy -- where the offending gene is replaced by a new one or overridden -- this therapy is reversible, said Adams.\n\n\"This will run its course. Ultimately, it will restore itself,\" he said.\n\nThe authors believe the same system could provide a highly targeted, selective way to reach many different genes and affect tumors that have untll now eluded drug therapy.\n\nObviously, the process will have to be refined and optimized before it's actually used for treatment.\n\n\"This is the first qualitative 'yes, we can do it' publication and it really has to be kept in that perspective,\" Adams said.\n\nThere's more on RNA interference at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Two independent sources were quoted.

Doctors typically gauge such illnesses based on self-reported symptoms and behavior.\n\nNow, a new study shows that a kind of brain scan called functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) - which shows how brain regions interact - can reliably detect fundamental differences in how individual brains are wired. As such, the technique potentially could be used to distinguish healthy people from people with brain diseases or disorders, and provide insight into variations in cognitive ability and personality traits.\n\nThe findings are published April 18 in Neuron.\n\n\"This is a step toward realizing the clinical promise of functional connectivity MRI,\" said senior author Steven Petersen, PhD, the James S. McDonnell Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience in Neurology and a professor of neurosurgery, of biomedical engineering, of psychological and brain sciences, and of radiology. \"Before we can develop diagnostic tests based on fcMRI, we need to know what it is actually measuring. We show here that it's not measuring what you're thinking, but how your brain is organized. That opens the door to an entire new field of clinical testing.\"\n\nPetersen, postdoctoral researcher and first author Caterina Gratton, PhD, and colleagues analyzed a set of data collected by the Midnight Scan Club, a group of Washington University scientists who took turns undergoing myriad scans in an MRI machine late at night, when the demand for such machines and, consequently, the usage fees tend to be low.\n\nThe researchers analyzed data from more than 10 hours of fcMRI scans on each of nine people, collected in 10 separate one-hour sessions for each person. During the scans, each person performed tasks related to vision, memory, reading or motor skills, or rested quietly.\n\nFunctional MRI scans generate a dynamic map of the outer surface of the brain, showing changing hot spots of activity over time. To create a functional connectivity map, Gratton divided the brain's surface into 333 regions and identified areas that became active and inactive in unison. She then constructed brain network maps for each individual, showing patterns of correlation between parts of the brain.\n\nThe sheer quantity of data available on each person allowed her to analyze how much an individual's brain networks changed from day to day and with different mental tasks.\n\nThe answer? Not much.\n\n\"Brain networks captured by fcMRI are really about the individual,\" Gratton said. \"Whether someone's watching a movie or thinking about her breakfast or moving her hands makes only a small difference. You can still identify that individual by her brain networks with a glance.\"\n\nThe consistency of the fcMRI scans makes them a promising diagnostic tool. Although the technique's potential to identify brain disorders and diseases was noted years ago, fcMRI-based diagnostic tests have yet to make their way into doctors' offices. Progress has been stymied by confusion over whether the scans reflect fundamental, stable features of the brain, or if they change with every passing thought.\n\nFurther, the researchers found that the technique was powerful enough to distinguish people who were extraordinarily alike. All of the scanned brains belonged to young, healthy scientists and doctors.\n\n\"We need more data before we can know what is normal variation in the population at large,\" Gratton said. \"But the individual differences were really easy to pick up, even in a population that is really very similar. It's exciting to think that these individual differences may be related to personality, cognitive ability, or psychiatric or neurological disease.

It develops in the pleura, the thin layer of tissue surrounding the lungs. As the tumor grows, it restricts the lungs, typically causing shortness of breath, fatigue, weight loss and/or chest discomfort and pain. In PD surgery, the pleura is removed. While the procedure cannot cure mesothelioma, it can help control the buildup of fluid, improve breathing and lessen cancer pain. Dr. Vigneswaran and colleagues administered a cancer quality-of-life survey known as the EORTC QLQ-C30 to 114 mesothelioma patients who underwent PD surgery. The median age was 70, with a range of 50 to 88. Prior to surgery, 31 percent of the patients had a performance status score of 0 (fully functional); 65 percent had a performance status score of 1 (able to do light house work or office work); and 4 percent had a performance status of 2 (ambulatory and capable of self-care, but unable to work).

To alleviate symptoms, steam inhalation and nasal irrigation are widely suggested as an alternative to common treatment with antibiotics, which are often not effective and contribute to antibiotic resistance.\n\nResearchers from the United Kingdom conducted a randomized controlled trial on the effectiveness of advice from primary care physicians to use nasal irrigation and/or steam inhalation for chronic sinusitis. The study involved 871 patients from 72 primary care practices in England who were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 advice strategies: usual care, daily nasal and saline irrigation supported by a demonstration video, daily steam inhalation, or combined treatment with both interventions.\n\n\"We have found that even a very brief intervention of a video showing patients how to use saline nasal irrigation can improve symptoms, help people feel they do not need to see the doctor to manage the problem, and reduce the amount of over-the-counter medication they need to use,\" said Dr. Paul Little, Primary Care and Population Sciences Unit, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.\n\nPatients who were instructed to use nasal irrigation showed improvement at 3 and 6 months, as measured by the Rhinosinusitis Disability Index. Steam inhalation did not appear to alleviate symptoms of sinusitis.\n\n\"We found potentially important changes in other outcomes; in particular, fewer participants in the nasal irrigation group than in the no-irrigation group had headaches, used over-the-counter medications and intended to consult a doctor in future episodes,\" write the authors. \"Although there was no significant difference in either physician visits or antibiotic use, as might be expected over only a 6-month follow-up period, our findings concerning consultations are important in the longer term, given antibiotic use increases the risk of antimicrobial resistance.\"\n\nSince the impact was less than in previous studies that had used more intensive coaching about nasal irrigation, the authors suggest that further research is needed to understand how much coaching of patients is required.", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "This release does not make any comment on the study funders.

Specifically, long-term XARELTO\u00ae use reduced the risk of stroke and systemic embolism by 32 percent and ischemic stroke alone by 31 percent compared to warfarin, with no significant increase in major bleeding. Results from the study, which also assessed the efficacy and safety of apixaban and dabigatran each versus warfarin, were recently published in the Journal of the American Heart Association.\n\nClick to Tweet: New two-year real-world data show Janssen blood thinner significantly reduced stroke in frail NVAF patients #JAHA #RWE #AFib https://ctt.ac/z3t2a+\n\nAffecting nearly six million Americans, NVAF increases a person's risk of stroke by five times and accounts for 15 to 20 percent of all strokes.i,ii Frailty is a common clinical syndrome mainly seen in older adults that makes it harder for them to recover from stressful cardiovascular events and vulnerable for poorer health outcomes. People with NVAF are four times more likely to be classified as frail than people without NVAF,iii and research has shown frail people with NVAF are less likely to receive anticoagulation than non-frail people.iv,v,vi\n\n\"There is not widespread consensus on the best way to manage frail patients with NVAF in clinical practice, which is why some patients are not treated at all and remain at high risk of having a stroke,\" said Craig Coleman, PharmD, Professor of Pharmacy Practice, University of Connecticut. \"These results show long-term rivaroxaban use reduced stroke and systemic embolism in a vulnerable patient group, without increasing the risk of major bleeding. They also give physicians important insights into a well-tolerated, effective approach to treat their frail patients with NVAF.\"\n\nIn the study, researchers used U.S. Truven MarketScan claims data and identified frail patients with NVAF taking XARELTO\u00ae, apixaban, or dabigatran. Each treatment group was matched separately with warfarin users in a 1:1 ratio and followed for up to two years or until an event, insurance disenrollment or end of follow-up occurred. The primary efficacy outcome was stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) or systemic embolism. Major bleeding was the primary safety outcome.\n\u2022 XARELTO\u00ae was associated with a 32 percent reduction in stroke or systemic embolism (HR=0.68; 95% CI=0.49-0.95) and 31 percent reduction in ischemic stroke alone (HR=0.69; 95% CI=0.48-0.99) compared to warfarin.\n\u2022 XARELTO\u00ae had similar rates of major bleeding compared to warfarin (HR=1.07; 95% CI=0.81-1.32).\n\u2022 Though both apixaban and dabigatran treatment were associated with numerically fewer strokes, neither statistically significantly reduced the risk of stroke or systemic embolism at two years compared to warfarin (HR=0.78; 95% CI=0.46-1.35 and HR=0.94; 95% CI=0.60-1.45).\n\u2022 Rates of major bleeding were also evaluated for apixaban versus warfarin (HR=0.72; 95% CI=0.49-1.06) and dabigatran versus warfarin (HR=0.87; 95% CI=0.63-1.19).\n\n\"This study adds to the growing body of evidence supporting the positive efficacy and safety profile of XARELTO\u00ae across a broad spectrum of patients with NVAF, which now includes the frail population,\" said Paul Burton, MD, PhD, FACC, Vice President, Medical Affairs, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Real-world data like this study are critical to informing and helping physicians best treat their patients' cardiovascular diseases.\"\n\n\n\nAbout the Frailty Study \n\nA total of 19,077 patients were identified using claims data from U.S. MarketScan databases from November 2011 to December 2016. These patients were new users of anticoagulant therapy with XARELTO\u00ae, apixaban, dabigatran, or warfarin, who had not been previously treated with an anticoagulant. They also had at least 12 months of continuous insurance coverage, and were considered frail. Frailty was determined using the Johns Hopkins Claims-based Frailty Indicator scoring algorithm, which weighs 21 criteria identifiable in claims data, including demographics, comorbidities, and physical and cognitive dysfunction.\n\nEach eligible XARELTO\u00ae, apixaban, and dabigatran user was propensity score matched to a warfarin user in a 1:1 ratio, which helped minimize the presence of baseline differences between cohorts. A total of 10,754 patients were included in the retrospective study, with 2,635 taking XARELTO\u00ae, 1,392 apixaban, 1,350 dabigatran, and 5,377 warfarin. This study was supported by Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.\n\nReal-world data have the potential to supplement randomized controlled trial data by providing additional information about how a medicine performs in routine medical practice; however, they have limitations and cannot be used as stand-alone evidence to validate the efficacy and/or safety of a treatment. \n\n\n\nAdditionally, it is possible some of the analyses within this specific study may not have been sufficiently powered based on smaller sample sizes.\n\nAbout Real-World XARELTO\u00ae Research \n\nXARELTO\u00ae is the most-studied oral Factor Xa inhibitor in the world today. More than 200,000 people have been evaluated in published real-world research since the approval of XARELTO\u00ae across all approved indications in the U.S. Post-marketing studies and registries continue to confirm the safety and efficacy of XARELTO\u00ae in routine clinical use across a broad spectrum of patients. There have been no head-to-head randomized trials directly comparing non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants.\n\nOne recent study, REVISIT-US, found XARELTO\u00ae is providing an appropriate balance of benefit and risk with respect to ischemic stroke and found a significant reduction in intracranial hemorrhage in routine clinical practice. These are two of the most serious types of events physicians work the hardest with their patients to avoid, given their potential for irreversible harm.\n\nXARELTO\u00ae (rivaroxaban) is a prescription medicine used to reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in people with atrial fibrillation not caused by a heart valve problem. For patients currently well managed on warfarin, there is limited information on how XARELTO\u00ae and warfarin compare in reducing the risk of stroke.\n\nXARELTO\u00ae is also a prescription medicine used to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and to reduce the risk of blood clots happening again in people who continue to be at risk for DVT or PE after receiving treatment for blood clots for at least 6 months.\n\nXARELTO\u00ae is also a prescription medicine used to reduce the risk of forming a blood clot in the legs and lungs of people who have just had knee or hip replacement surgery.\n\nWhat is the most important information I should know about XARELTO\u00ae (rivaroxaban)?\n\u2022 For people taking XARELTO\u00ae for atrial fibrillation: People with atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart beat) are at an increased risk of forming a blood clot in the heart, which can travel to the brain, causing a stroke, or to other parts of the body. XARELTO\u00ae lowers your chance of having a stroke by helping to prevent clots from forming. If you stop taking XARELTO\u00ae, you may have increased risk of forming a clot in your blood.\n\nDo not stop taking XARELTO\u00ae without talking to the doctor who prescribes it for you. Stopping XARELTO\u00ae increases your risk of having a stroke.\n\nIf you have to stop taking XARELTO\u00ae, your doctor may prescribe another blood thinner medicine to prevent a blood clot from forming.\n\u2022 XARELTO\u00ae can cause bleeding, which can be serious, and rarely may lead to death. This is because XARELTO\u00ae is a blood thinner medicine (anticoagulant) that reduces blood clotting. While you take XARELTO\u00ae you are likely to bruise more easily, and it may take longer for bleeding to stop.\n\nYou may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take XARELTO\u00ae and take other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding, including:\n\u2022 Any medicine that contains heparin\n\u2022 Other medicines to prevent or treat blood clots\n\nTell your doctor if you take any of these medicines. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure if your medicine is one listed above.\n\nCall your doctor or get medical help right away if you develop any of these signs or symptoms of bleeding:\n\u2022 Unexpected bleeding or bleeding that lasts a long time, such as:\n\u2022 Menstrual bleeding that is heavier than normal, or vaginal bleeding\n\u2022 Bleeding that is severe or you cannot control\n\u2022 Bright red or black stools (looks like tar)\n\u2022 Vomit blood or your vomit looks like \"coffee grounds\"\n\u2022 Pain, swelling, or new drainage at wound sites\n\u2022 Spinal or epidural blood clots (hematoma): People who take a blood thinner medicine like XARELTO\u00ae, and have medicine injected into their spinal and epidural area, or have a spinal puncture, have a risk of forming a blood clot that can cause long-term or permanent loss of the ability to move (paralysis). Your risk of developing a spinal or epidural blood clot is higher if:\n\u2022 A thin tube called an epidural catheter is placed in your back to give you certain medicine\n\u2022 You take NSAIDs or a medicine to prevent blood from clotting\n\u2022 You have a history of difficult or repeated epidural or spinal punctures\n\u2022 You have a history of problems with your spine or have had surgery on your spine\n\nIf you take XARELTO\u00ae and receive spinal anesthesia or have a spinal puncture, your doctor should watch you closely for symptoms of spinal or epidural blood clots. Tell your doctor right away if you have back pain, tingling, numbness, muscle weakness (especially in your legs and feet), or loss of control of the bowels or bladder (incontinence).\n\u2022 XARELTO\u00ae is not for people with artificial heart valves.\n\nDo not take XARELTO\u00ae if you:\n\u2022 Currently have certain types of abnormal bleeding. Talk to your doctor before taking XARELTO\u00ae if you currently have unusual bleeding.\n\u2022 Are allergic to rivaroxaban or any of the ingredients of XARELTO\u00ae.\n\nBefore taking XARELTO\u00ae, tell your doctor about all your medical conditions, including if you:\n\u2022 Have ever had bleeding problems\n\u2022 Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if XARELTO\u00ae will harm your unborn baby.\n\u2022 Tell your doctor right away if you become pregnant during treatment with XARELTO\u00ae. Taking XARELTO\u00ae while you are pregnant may increase the risk of bleeding in you or in your unborn baby.\n\u2022 If you take XARELTO\u00ae during pregnancy, tell your doctor right away if you have any signs or symptoms of bleeding or blood loss. See \"What is the most important information I should know about XARELTO\u00ae?\" for signs and symptoms of bleeding.\n\u2022 Are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. XARELTO\u00ae may pass into your breast milk. You and your doctor should decide if you will take XARELTO\u00ae or breastfeed.\n\nTell all of your doctors and dentists that you are taking XARELTO\u00ae. They should talk to the doctor who prescribed XARELTO\u00ae for you before you have any surgery, medical or dental procedure.\n\nTell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Some of your other medicines may affect the way XARELTO\u00ae works. Certain medicines may increase your risk of bleeding. See \"What is the most important information I should know about XARELTO\u00ae?\"\n\nHow should I take XARELTO\u00ae?\n\u2022 Take XARELTO\u00ae exactly as prescribed by your doctor.\n\u2022 Do not change your dose or stop taking XARELTO\u00ae unless your doctor tells you to.\n\u2022 Your doctor may change your dose if needed.\n\u2022 If you take XARELTO\u00ae for:\n\u2022 Take XARELTO\u00ae 1 time a day with your evening meal.\n\u2022 If you miss a dose of XARELTO\u00ae, take it as soon as you remember on the same day. Take your next dose at your regularly scheduled time.\n\u2022 Blood clots in the veins of your legs or lungs:\n\u2022 Take XARELTO\u00ae 1 or 2 times a day as prescribed by your doctor.\n\u2022 For the 15-mg and 20-mg doses, XARELTO\u00ae should be taken with food.\n\u2022 For the 10-mg dose, XARELTO\u00ae may be taken with or without food.\n\u2022 Take your XARELTO\u00ae dose(s) at the same time each day.\n\u2022 If you take the 15-mg dose of XARELTO\u00ae 2 times a day (a total of 30 mg of XARELTO\u00ae in 1 day): Take XARELTO\u00ae as soon as you remember on the same day. You may take 2 doses at the same time to make up for the missed dose. Take your next dose at your regularly scheduled time.\n\u2022 If you take XARELTO\u00ae 1 time a day: Take XARELTO\u00ae as soon as you remember on the same day.

It could also help keep you thinking clearly.\n\nNew research shows that sticking to the Mediterranean diet, previously shown to reduce heart and other health issues, also may help lower the risk of having small areas of dead tissue linked to thinking problems. Known as brain infarcts, they're involved in vascular dementia, the second most common form of dementia, after Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"We've got these diseases of aging that cause disability, cost a ton of money to treat and manage, and wreck people's lives,\" said Dr. Gregory Cole, a professor of medicine and neurology at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was not involved in this new study. \"You've got to get in there and figure out what actually works for prevention, and not have people guessing.\"\n\nA Mediterranean diet includes a lot of fruit, vegetables and fish, olive oil, legumes and cereals, and fewer dishes containing dairy, meat, poultry, and saturated fatty acids than other diets. It also involves small to moderate amounts of alcohol.\n\nThe study relates diet to strokes, said Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, a neurologist at Columbia University Medical Center and lead author of the study. The research will be presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in April.\n\nAn infarct, a kind of stroke, happens when the passage of blood is slowed or completely blocked by clotting. This study looked at people who had never had a clinical stroke, but may have had smaller strokes that went unnoticed. An MRI brain scan can detect these small strokes.\n\nThe study looked at 712 people over the age of 65 living in New York. Participants were asked about their diet and then, about six years later, underwent an MRI. In general, dietary patterns are consistent for at least seven or eight years, Scarmeas said.\n\nResearchers found that people who most closely followed a Mediterranean-like diet were 36 percent less likely to have areas of brain damage, compared with those whose eating habits were furthest from the diet.\n\nThe study shows association, not causation, meaning there could be some other factors linking the Mediterranean diet to resilience against this form of brain damage. For example, other research has found that higher adherence to the diet seems to protect against hypertension, also associated with these brain problems.\n\nBut in this new research, when the scientists controlled for hypertension, the diet was still linked to a lower risk of brain damage. It is possible that the diet protects the brain vessels themselves, irrespective of other problems such as high blood pressure, Scarmeas said.\n\nThe participants who followed the Mediterranean diet the least had an increased risk for having strokes that was similar to people with hypertension. Those who most strongly adhered to the dietary regimen had a level of protection similar to people who did not have hypertension.\n\nScarmeas' previous research has shown that the Mediterranean diet may reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Looking at 2,250 individuals from the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project, researchers found a 40 percent lower risk among those who stuck to this diet, scientists reported in the Annals of Neurology in 2006. The people involved in the brain infarcts study are a subset of that original group.\n\nAs many as 2.4 million to 4.5 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, according to the National Institute on Aging. Between 1 and 4 percent of people over the age of 65 have vascular dementia, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nOther studies have suggested that this food regimen may help in preventing second heart attacks, lowering cancer risk and stopping the need for diabetes drugs in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe new study \"gives you better evidence than ever that this is actually protective, and protective against the development of dementia,\" Cole said.\n\nThe risk factors for vascular disease overlap with those of Alzheimer's disease, he said. These include high blood pressure, high-fat diets, type 2 diabetes and low folate intake. People who have both Alzheimer's and vascular disease -- a condition called mixed dementia -- have a more rapid progression of Alzheimer's disease, Cole said.\n\nA subsequent issue to address is whether a person must follow the entire Mediterranean diet in order to reap these benefits, or whether there are portions of it that contribute positive effects, Cole said. It would be easier for people to focus on adding particular elements to their diets -- for example, by taking fish oil capsules -- rather than trying to readjust their eating habits altogether.\n\nCole's own research deals with fish oil, which is relevant because fish is a component in the Mediterranean diet. The bottom line for dementia is that fish oil may help in the very early stages, but more research must be done to confirm this, he said.\n\nIn a study, his group found that DHA fatty acids from fish oil could delay or deter the onset of Alzheimer's disease in rats or older mice that had been genetically altered to develop the condition. Also, a recent study found that the DHA component of fish oil from algae helped people with minor memory impairment, but this needs to be replicated in order to be more definitive, he said.\n\nWhen Scarmeas' group looked at the individual components of the diet, they found a stronger association between the overall diet and brain damage prevention than with any individual food in the diet, suggesting that the combination all of the elements may be producing the effect, Scarmeas said.\n\nResearchers will continue to follow the participants in the study and check in on them every year and a half, Scarmeas said.\n\nThe next step would be to have controlled experiments concerning food and dementia in which participants are randomly assigned to follow a diet, Cole said. It is complicated in general to compare the benefits of a particular diet with the benefits of not following a different food regimen.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "\u00a0The story has a quote from a clinician who does not appear to be associated with the research to be presented that was reported on.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Propping open clogged arteries with a tiny wire-mesh tube called a stent is no better at reducing the risk of heart attack or death in patients with stable heart disease than treatment with medications, according to a large new study that challenges routine use of a procedure that rapidly became standard medical practice.\n\nThe study of more than 2,000 patients found that those who underwent the expensive procedure, known as angioplasty, in non-emergency situations were no less likely to suffer a heart attack or die than those who took only aspirin and other medicines to lower blood pressure and cholesterol and prevent clots, along with adopting lifestyle changes.\n\nThe study is the first large, well-designed comparison of angioplasty to non-surgical care for patients who are not having a heart attack or in imminent danger of having one.

Nissen, president of the American College of Cardiology. \"I think this is going to shake things up pretty significantly.\"\n\nThe findings underscore the danger of rushing to adopt a procedure before careful studies have been conducted to fully determine its benefits, Boden and others said.\n\n\"There was just this intuitive belief that it would be beneficial,\" Boden said. \"But no one had ever done a proper randomized trial to see whether it actually improved outcomes. In the meantime, a whole industry has been created around this.\"\n\nThe researchers and others stressed that angioplasty clearly benefits patients who are in the throes of a heart attack or are at very high risk for one. But the findings indicate that for a patient whose condition is stable, medical therapy is just as effective at reducing the major risks. Such patients constitute at least one-third of those undergoing the 1.2 million angioplasties performed each year, and perhaps as much as 85 percent.\n\nSome cardiologists who specialize in the procedures, however, argued that the study did not focus on the sickest patients who are most likely to benefit, and that the main purpose of angioplasty in many is to alleviate chest pain, not to prevent heart attacks.\n\n\"I don't think this is going to cause any huge paradigm shift,\" said Gregory J. Dehmer, president of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions. \"This study was limited to a fairly select group of patients with very stable symptoms.\"\n\nBut Boden said that the study did include patients with moderate to severe heart disease and that many such patients undergo the procedure in the belief it will protect them against heart attacks.\n\nIn the procedure, doctors thread a tiny balloon into clogged arteries, inflate the balloon to clear the blockage, and insert a stent -- a tiny wire lattice strut that props the artery open. The procedure costs about $50,000 and is considered safe, though it does carry some risks.\n\nThe findings come on the heels of questions about the safety of new stents coated with drugs to keep arteries from reclosing. Those concerns had led doctors to curtail their use of the newer devices, and the new findings are expected to have a similar effect on angioplasty overall.\n\n\"There was an overexuberance,\" said William O'Neill, a prominent cardiologist at the University of Miami. \"I think we're getting a midcourse correction.\"\n\nThe findings could also help fuel a resurgence of bypass surgery, which has become far less common with the rise of angioplasty.\n\n\"There was this sense that angioplasty would produce the same result as bypass surgery,\" Nissen said. \"I think this will cause a tilt toward more patients with stable conditions choosing medical therapy and more people who have more severe disease getting bypass surgery, which both relieves symptoms and reduces the risk for heart attack and death.\"\n\nThe new study, which was funded mostly by the Department of Veterans Affairs, involved 2,287 patients at 50 centers in the United States and Canada who had chest pain or other symptoms because one or more major arteries supplying blood to the heart had clogged. Half the patients received standard medical treatment involving medication and lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, eating better and exercising. The other half received the same treatment plus angioplasty.\n\nAfter about five years, the number of patients who experienced a heart attack, were hospitalized or died because of their heart problems was virtually identical in the two groups, the researchers found.\n\n\"There was no significant difference,\" Boden said. \"The data are clear.\"\n\nAlthough about one-third of patients who initially got medical treatment later turned to angioplasty, the findings show how much medical treatment of heart disease has improved, Boden said.\n\n\"The paradigm for the last 20 years for patients like this been: 'Mr. Jones, you need a procedure.' End of discussion,\" Boden said. \"I hope this will make people realize that patients have more options. They can safely choose to try medical therapy first.\"\n\nAlthough study patients receiving angioplasty were somewhat more likely to be free of chest pain, known as angina, even that benefit was marginal, Boden said. After nearly five years, 74 percent of those patients were free of chest pain, compared with 72 percent of those who had medical treatment alone.\n\n\"One of the unexpected findings is that it's amazing how remarkably good medical therapy was for relieving angina,\" Boden said.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Several sources are quoted.\u00a0 ", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Oct. 28, 2010 -- A University of Manchester, England, engineering professor has invented a portable breast scanner that could lead to more accurate tests for younger women without the need for X-rays. The scanner is based on radiofrequency technology, which is able to quickly show malignant and benign tumors when linked to a computer. It could be used in doctors\u2019 offices.\n\nRadiofrequency or microwave technology for breast cancer detection is not new, but what Zhipeng Wu, PhD, from Manchester\u2019s School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering has achieved is the speed of results and portability. The patented real-time radiofrequency scanner uses computer tomography and works by using the same technology as a mobile phone, but with only a tiny fraction of its power. Costs are reduced and the electronics fit into a case the size of a lunchbox.\n\nCurrent mammography testing works well for detecting breast cancer in women over 50 with results of up to 95% accuracy. The Manchester team says it is far less effective for younger women, where the detection rate could be as low as 60% for women under the age of 50. This group, the team says, accounts for 20% of all breast cancer cases.\n\nWhile mammography works on breast density, radiofrequency looks at contrasts between normal and diseased breast tissues. The breast is placed in a scanner cup and an image appears on screen. Tumors or other abnormalities show up in red. Wu says in a news release: \u201cThe system we have is portable and as soon as you lie down you can get a scan -- it\u2019s real-time. The real-time imaging minimizes the chance of missing a breast tumor during scanning.\u201d Wu says it will even work through a bra. \u201cAlthough there is still research to be done, the system has great potential to bring a new way for breast cancer diagnosis.\u201d\n\nCarolyn Rogers, clinical nurse specialist at Breast Cancer Care in the U.K., says in an emailed statement: \u201cEvidence is needed to demonstrate the accuracy and uses of this device. The most effective screening tool for detecting breast cancer is mammography and for women of all ages to remain breast aware, reporting any changes to their [doctor].\u201d", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "An independent source was consulted.

They\u2019re all in the brain.\n\nVarious smartphone apps say they offer this kind of vision-improving training; I used one called GlassesOff, the only one I found that was backed by scientific studies.\n\nPerceptual learning can improve the vision of people who already see quite well and those with other conditions. For example, a study tested the approach in 23 young adults, around age 24. Compared with a control group of 20 young adults, the treatment group increased letter recognition speed. Similar training is an effective component in treating amblyopia, also called \u201clazy eye,\u201d which is the most frequent cause of vision loss in infants and children, affecting 3 percent of the population. It may also improve vision in those with mild myopia (nearsightedness).\n\nIt should be acknowledged that some researchers involved in many of these studies have financial ties to GlassesOff. However, other studies with no commercial links obtained similar results, and several scientists I spoke to, including those without ties to GlassesOff, thought the science behind the app was credible.

Then the brain must coordinate activity across sets of neurons to assemble these features into recognizable objects like chairs, faces, letters or words. Reading at our normal pace, the brain has only about 250 milliseconds to do this work until the eyes automatically move onto the next letter or word.

The MedDiet is also low in dairy, has minimal red meat, and uses olive oil as its major source of fat.\n\nLeading author Roy Hardman from the Centre for Human Psychopharmacology Swinburne University of Technology Melbourne Australia and his colleagues evaluated all the available papers between 2000-2015 that investigated if and how a MedDiet may impact cognitive processes over time. In total, 18 out of the 135 articles met their strict inclusion criteria.\n\n\"The most surprising result was that the positive effects were found in countries around the whole world. So regardless of being located outside of what is considered the Mediterranean region, the positive cognitive effects of a higher adherence to a MedDiet were similar in all evaluated papers;\" he said.\n\nAttention, memory, and language improved. Memory, in particular, was positively affected by the MedDiet including improvements in: delayed recognition, long-term, and working memory, executive function, and visual constructs.\n\n\"Why is a higher adherence to the MedDiet related to slowing down the rate of cognitive decline? The MedDiet offers the opportunity to change some of the modifiable risk factors,\" he explained.\n\n\"These include reducing inflammatory responses, increasing micronutrients, improving vitamin and mineral imbalances, changing lipid profiles by using olive oils as the main source of dietary fats, maintaining weight and potentially reducing obesity, improving polyphenols in the blood, improving cellular energy metabolism and maybe changing the gut micro-biota, although this has not been examined to a larger extent yet.\"\n\nMoreover, the benefits to cognition afforded by the MedDiet were not exclusive to older individuals. Two of the included studies focused on younger adults and they both found improvements in cognition using computerized assessments.\n\nThe researchers stress that research in this area is important due to the expected extensive population aging over the next 20-30 years. They envision that the utilization of a dietary pattern, such as the MedDiet, will be an essential tool to maintain quality of life and reduce the potential social and economic burdens of manifested cognitive declines like dementia.\n\n\"I would therefore recommend people to try to adhere or switch to a MedDiet, even at an older age,\" Hardman added.\n\nLike many researchers, Hardman takes his research home: \"I follow the diet patterns and do not eat any red meats, chicken or pork.

Opioid overdoses continue to plague communities nation-wide. The SCSO recognizes this effective medical intervention as another way to help combat the opioid overdose threat to our community.\"\n\nOpioid emergencies, such as an accidental overdose, are a growing public health epidemic. On average, 79 people die from opioids, including prescription opioid analgesics and heroin, everyday in the United States; most occur outside of medical settings, such as in a home.[1],[2] Approximately 136,000 opioid overdose emergency department visits occur each year.[3] Many communities throughout the United States are facing a devastating heroin epidemic. Additionally, there are nearly two times the number of prescription opioid-related deaths as compared to heroin-related deaths.1 On average, 3,300 children five years old and younger are admitted to emergency departments each year due to accidental opioid exposure.[4]\n\nLife-threatening opioid emergencies result in respiratory and/or central nervous system depression. Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression (OIRD) is the most important serious adverse effect of opioids as it can be immediately life-threatening.[5] In addition to the risk of an opioid overdose associated with an opioid use disorder, there may be an increased risk of life-threatening OIRD even when patients take a prescribed dose of an opioid as directed. For example, taking high doses of opioids, taking an opioid in combination with other drugs (e.g., benzodiazepines) or alcohol, or if there is a history of certain medical conditions (e.g., COPD, severe asthma) places individuals at significantly higher risk for life-threatening OIRD.[6],[7],[8] Seconds count when a life-threatening OIRD event occurs. Without rapid intervention, brain injury or death can occur in as little as 4 minutes.[9] Most life-threatening OIRD emergencies occur in the home and are witnessed by family and friends who may be in the best position to intervene quickly.[10]\n\nNaloxone is an opioid antagonist that displaces opioids from the receptors in the brain, temporarily reversing the life-threatening breathing problems that can occur during an opioid emergency.[11]\n\nEVZIO (naloxone HCl injection) Auto-injector is an opioid antagonist indicated for the emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose, as manifested by respiratory and/or central nervous system depression.

The new moms found that the conversations helped relieve symptoms.\n\n\u201cPostpartum depression is a problem for one in seven women, and many of them don\u2019t get help because there\u2019s a stigma and they don\u2019t have time and it\u2019s expensive,\u201d said study leader Dr. Nicole Letourneau, a professor and research chair in parent-infant mental health at the University of Calgary. \u201cTraining peer counselors to do phone counseling is an effective, low-cost and non-stigmatizing way for new moms to get the help they need.\u201d\n\nParticularly for first-time mothers, postpartum depression can be hard to distinguish from the stress and fatigue that come with caring for a new infant around the clock, Letourneau said. Symptoms can include sadness, insomnia, difficulty concentrating and making decisions, feelings of shame or guilt, as well as difficulty bonding with the baby or thoughts about harming the baby.\n\nTo assess the effectiveness of phone counseling for easing these symptoms, Letourneau and colleagues identified 64 mothers with symptoms of major depression within 24 months after delivery and offered them up to 12 weekly peer support calls.\n\nThe average mom with depression was about 26 years old. Most had symptoms of depression before they got pregnant, and many had previously been treated with medication or professional counseling.\n\nThe women who volunteered as peer counselors attended an eight-hour training course and received reference materials about postpartum depression. They also had nurses available for phone consults if they had concerns about anything the moms said during their conversations.\n\nBy midway through the study, 37 new moms had received at least one call from a peer counsellor. On average, the women spoke more than eight times and the calls typically lasted about 38 minutes, the researchers reported in the Journal of Advanced Nursing.\n\nOver the second half of the study, 34 mothers had at least one phone conversation with a peer counsellor. On average, they spoke about three times.\n\nMothers who left the study said they no longer needed support, sought counseling from mental health professionals, or didn\u2019t have time for the phone calls.\n\nWhile all of the mothers were depressed at the start of the study, at mid-point only 32 percent were at risk for depression, and this declined to 15 percent at the end. Furthermore, at mid-point, 60 percent of the mothers had low depression scores; this percentage rose to 75 percent at end.\n\nEven though the small study had several women drop out and lacked a control group of moms who received different treatment, the results are consistent with previous research that has proven peer counseling works, said Dr. Ruta Nonacs, a psychiatrist at the Center for Women\u2019s Mental Health at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.\n\n\u201cIt is a very powerful experience to be able to talk to a woman who has gone through the same thing and come out the other side,\u201d said Nonacs, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cA lot of first-time moms wonder what\u2019s normal, what\u2019s depression, and what to do with the fact that they feel overwhelmed and alone and like their experience looks nothing like the happy moms they see smiling in all of the baby food and diaper commercials.\u201d\n\nBecause postpartum depression is the most common complication of childbirth, it makes sense to explore peer counseling and other interventions that can reach women in rural or suburban areas where access to mental health professionals may be limited, said Dr. Samantha Meltzer-Brody, director of the perinatal psychiatry program at the Center for Women\u2019s Mood Disorders at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\n\u201cMost people in the world have access to a telephone,\u201d said Meltzer-Brody, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cThis study, while small, suggests that peer phone counseling could be a very effective, widespread public health intervention.\u201d", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story quotes two outside sources and notes explicitly that they were not involved in the current study.

Kris-Etherton, PhD, distinguished professor of nutrition at Pennsylvania State University, publish their findings in the Journal of the American Heart Association.\n\nIt is well known that avocados are high in fat, but the majority of an avocado's fat is monounsaturated, which is deemed a \"good\" type of fat. It is known that monounsaturated fats can help lower levels of bad cholesterol, reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\nFor their study, Kris-Etherton and colleagues set out to assess how avocado consumption - by replacing saturated fatty acids, or \"bad\" fats - affected risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases.\n\nThe team recruited 45 healthy participants aged 21-70 years who were either obese or overweight.\n\nEvery participant was required to follow each of three cholesterol-lowering diets for 5 weeks. The diets consisted of a lower-fat diet without avocado, a moderate-fat diet without avocado or a moderate-fat diet with one Hass avocado a day.\n\nPrior to starting each diet, subjects ate what the researchers deem an \"average American diet,\" which was made up of 34% of calories from fat, 16% from protein, while around half of calories were from carbohydrates.\n\nFrom both of the moderate-fat diets, participants gained 34% of calories from fat, of which 17% were from monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). The lower-fat diet provided participants with 24% of calories from fat, of which 11% was from MUFAs.\n\nModerate-fat diet with one avocado a day lowered 'bad' cholesterol by 13.5 mg/dL\n\nThe researchers found that participants' levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) - referred to as the \"bad\" cholesterol - were an average of 8.3 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) lower after following the lower-fat diet without an avocado and 7.4 mg/dL lower after following the moderate-fat diet without an avocado, compared with their baseline average.\n\nHowever, after participants followed the moderate-fat diet with one avocado a day, their LDL levels were found to be an average of 13.5 mg/dL lower than their baseline average.\n\nWhat is more, the team found that a number of additional blood measurements - such as total cholesterol, small dense LDL, triglycerides and non-HDL (high-density lipoprotein) - were better after participants followed the moderate-fat diet with one avocado a day, compared with the other two diets.\n\nAlthough these findings demonstrate that an avocado a day alongside a moderate-fat diet has the potential to reduce bad cholesterol, the team notes that their research was a controlled feeding study. \"That is not the real-world,\" says Kris-Etherton, \"so it is a proof-of-concept investigation.\"\n\nStill, the team believes their findings indicate that people should consider replacing saturated fatty acids in their diet with healthier fats from avocados and other sources. Kris-Etherton adds:\n\n\"We need to focus on getting people to eat a heart-healthy diet that includes avocados and other nutrient-rich food sources of better fats. In the United States avocados are not a mainstream food yet, and they can be expensive, especially at certain times of the year. Also, most people do not really know how to incorporate them in their diet except for making guacamole. But guacamole is typically eaten with corn chips, which are high in calories and sodium. Avocados, however, can also be eaten with salads, vegetables, sandwiches, lean protein foods (like chicken or fish) or even whole.\"\n\nIt should be noted that this research was supported by the Hass Avocado Board, but the researchers say the organization played no other role in the study.\n\nIn January 2014, Medical News Today reported on a study suggesting that consuming half an avocado with lunch each day may satisfy hunger in overweight individuals and help with weight management.\n\nOur Knowledge Center article on the health benefits of avocado reveals some of the other ways the food may be good for us, as well as the potential risks of avocado consumption.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story includes quotes from the principal author that help place the study in context, and it notes that the story was funded by Haas Avocado Board.

The prostate is a walnut-shaped gland that produces semen and it is hard to get to.\n\nDigital rectal exams can tell a specialist that the prostate is getting bigger, but that happens with normal aging as well as with cancer. A blood test for prostate specific antigen or PSA shows when PSA rises, but PSA goes up with either cancer or just normal enlargement of the prostate \u2014 or even if the gland is inflamed, such as from an infection.\n\nBiopsies are difficult and painful to do and may take a portion of healthy prostate, missing any tumors entirely.\n\nAnd prostate tumors can grow slowly. A study last year estimated that more than 1 million men in the United States alone had been needlessly treated for prostate tumors that likely would never have killed them.\n\nThe Progensa test looks for a genetic material called PCA3. It is a string of RNA that does not appear to have any function but that is overexpressed, or overactive, in prostate cancer.\n\nLightly touching the prostate can cause its release and it can then be detected in the urine using the test.\n\nCrawford and colleagues tested Progensa in about 1,900 men who had high PSA readings, an abnormal digital rectal exam or both and who were scheduled to have biopsies.\n\n\u201cIt reflects on the aggressiveness of the cancer,\u201d Crawford said. \u201cIf you had no cancer your PCA3 was at 25 or 20. If you had precursors such as high grade PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) your score was about 38 to 40 and men who had cancer scored about 50 to 55.\u201d\n\nThe test had a specificity of 78 percent, meaning that 78 percent of the men who had cancer indicated by the test actually did. This compares to just 21 percent for PSA alone, the researchers told a meeting of the American Urological Association in San Francisco.\n\n\u201cIf the PCA3 is abnormal, above about 35, you have got an 80 percent chance of having cancer,\u201d Crawford said.\n\nThe test had a sensitivity of 49 percent, meaning it correctly identified 49 percent of cancers. This is far less sensitive than PSA, which catches 87 percent of tumors, but if the two tests are used together they can help rule out the need for unnecessary surgery or radiation.\n\nAmong the 1,946 men studied, 42 percent turned out to have prostate cancer.\n\nThe test was approved for use in Europe in 2006 but is not yet approved in the United States.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Only a single conflicted source was quoted: one of the principal investigators of the study reported on. \u00a0Considering this study was presented at the annual meeting of the American Urological Association, it seems that there were many around who could have offered expert opinion and insight about this test.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "RUTLAND, Vt. \u2014 For the first time in John R. Brown\u2019s two-decade quest for the right medication to make his brain behave, his psychiatrist offered him hope in the form of what seemed like rock-solid science.\n\nBy collecting the former editor\u2019s DNA with a quick cheek swab, a new genetic test retailing at $3,800 would reveal which depression medications Brown would likely respond well to and those he would not.\n\nThe GeneSight test result helped prompt Brown\u2019s psychiatrist to switch him to a new drug in June, making Brown, 40, optimistic that there might be a path back to a job, an apartment, and even a new girlfriend. But three weeks later he was suicidal, checking into a mental hospital at his therapist\u2019s urging.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help but wonder if I should have stuck with the devil I know,\u2019\u2019 Brown now says.\n\nGenetic tests to identify the most effective psychiatric drugs are the hot new technology in the race to create personalized treatments based on people\u2019s DNA. More than 600,000 of these tests have likely been administered in the last three years, based on company websites and research data, to better treat conditions ranging from depression to attention deficit disorder to anxiety. In a nod to the tests\u2019 growing acceptance, the federal Medicare program last year agreed for the first time to pay for the GeneSight test for some depressed patients.\n\nBut a review by the New England Center for Investigative Reporting has found that virtually all the evidence that these psychiatric tests work is based on limited studies funded by the companies themselves or researchers they fund, including all five studies used to promote GeneSight on the company\u2019s website.\n\nThe federal government doesn\u2019t require companies to prove that this and thousands of other tests are accurate before marketing and selling them. Unlike drugs, the Food and Drug Administration does not regulate them, though that may soon change.\n\nSome of the testing firms\u2019 research practices also raise questions about potential conflicts of interest. For example, California-based Proove Biosciences provides a full-time employee to administer and run a study on the company\u2019s test at a Littleton, Mass., mental health clinic. It pays clinicians for time spent related to the study, a relationship that could give clinicians an incentive to steer patients to the test \u2014 and give the company access to insurance reimbursement for those patients.\n\nPatients also cannot find out for themselves if their doctor stands to gain financially by recommending a personalized medicine test. A public federal database created in 2014 to disclose financial relationships between the health care industry and physicians excludes most genetic tests.\n\n\u201cIt is the Wild West,\u2019\u2019 said Mildred Cho, associate director at the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics, who says there is little published evidence on the effectiveness of drug response tests.\n\nEric Lander, a leader of the Human Genome Project and founding director of the Broad Institute in Cambridge, goes further, saying in a New England Journal of Medicine article earlier this year that the mental health testing company claims are \u201cnot harmless and may be quite dangerous.\u201d\n\nIn psychiatry, a field hampered by a lack of definitive tests for conditions and treatments alike, the idea of a genetic test to identify the drugs most likely to be effective is particularly appealing as a way to cut down on the trial-and-error approach to medications that many patients face.\n\nAnd the tests do hold promise. The basic science behind them is built on years of solid research \u2014 analyzing an individual\u2019s genetic make-up to determine how they may respond to drugs. GeneSight\u2019s test was developed using technology from the respected Mayo Clinic and Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center.\n\nOfficials at Assurex Health, the Ohio-based company that makes GeneSight, stand behind their product. They make no guarantee that GeneSight will lead doctors to pick the right medicine for patients, but they point to company studies that show it more than doubles the odds they will. Plus, the officials note, the test underwent close review by a Medicare contractor before the agency agreed to pay for the tests.\n\n\u201cPatients do better,\u2019\u2019 said Bryan M. Dechairo, senior vice president of medical affairs and clinical development for Assurex. \u201cWe continue to do more studies\u201d to show the test\u2019s value.\n\nThe amount of money at stake is enormous. Psychiatric conditions affect 1 in 4 adults every year and 1 in 5 teens, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Finding a test to more precisely target treatment could help troubled people find help more quickly, cut down on side effects, and save money. It can also make hundreds of millions of dollars for the test makers, which helps explain why at least 15 companies are now ramping up mental health testing.\n\n\u201cIt is so much more than just getting the medications right,\u2019\u2019 said Rachel Scott, vice president of clinical research and operations for Pennsylvania-based test maker Genomind. \u201cIt is giving patients the opportunity to step outside the stigma of mental illness, for them to see this is their biology \u2014 and give their clinician some objective information.\u201d\n\nBut psychiatric genetics remains in its infancy. Aggressive marketing and a lack of regulation of tests that have a thin scientific foundation have raised concerns for some bioethicists.\n\n\u201cThe claims of these companies are weak,\u2019\u2019 said Robert Klitzman, a psychiatrist and bioethicist at Columbia University in New York who had a commentary published last week in a mental health journal calling for vigilance in the marketing of genetic mental health tests.\n\n\u201cConflicts of interest in the field are major problems,\u201d he said.\n\nLast fall, the owners of the New England Center for Mental Health in Littleton, an adult and child clinic, were asked to be part of a research study.\n\nCalifornia-based Proove Biosciences wanted the center to join a national study, aimed in part at better understanding how its tests benefited adults with mental health conditions.\n\nThe company would provide the center with a full-time research assistant stationed in an office behind the reception desk. If a clinician and patient decided a Proove drug metabolism test, which analyzes 69 genetic variants, would be useful, the assistant would take the patient\u2019s DNA with a cheek swab, collect insurance information for Proove to be reimbursed, and administer extensive questionnaires to track how the test worked out over time.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to offer our patients a test that could really help them,\u2019\u2019 said Jessica X. Hennessey, director of operations and management at the Center for Mental Health.\n\nThe center received a one-time payment of $600 from Proove for training and is allowed to bill $150 for each hour of clinical research service and services rendered by Littleton staff members related to the study, according to Ernie Corrigan, a spokesman for the center. The Center for Mental Health has billed Proove a little more than $5,600 since then, Corrigan said.\n\nProove officials and Hennessey said clinicians are never compensated based on the type or number of tests they order, and clinicians do not promote the swab test in any way.\n\n\u201cThe tests are only ordered if they are medically necessary,\u201d said Brian Meshkin, Proove\u2019s founder and CEO.\n\nBut the close arrangement raises eyebrows among bioethicists because it can lead to the appearance of clinicians ordering the test to receive compensation for the study.\n\n\u201cThere is a big set of ethical concerns here,\u2019\u2019 said Columbia\u2019s Klitzman, after being told about the Littleton study. He said those concerns are especially pronounced if doctors have financial incentives and \u201corder tests that have no clear proven benefit.\u201d\n\nFederal officials are growing increasingly concerned about such research-physician arrangements in the genetic testing field. Late last year, a large study that included psychiatric drug response by New Orleans-based Renaissance RX was shut down after Medicare halted payments and began a review. A Rhode Island doctor also sued the company, charging, in part, that Renaissance RX enrolled ineligible people in order to bill insurance.\n\nMeanwhile, the Office of the Inspector General for the US Department of Health and Human Services last year singled out compensation agreements related to research studies in a special fraud alert, noting there were growing cases of doctors receiving improper incentives regarding referrals.\n\nThe GeneSight test has gotten the most outside scrutiny among the tests because it faced review by Medicare before the agency agreed to cover it for certain patients with depression.\n\nMedicare contractors were swayed by company-funded studies showing that when these patients took the medications recommended by the test, they had fewer symptoms after eight weeks compared with patients who did not use the test.\n\n\u201cUse of the test to aid in [drug selection] has improved patient responses to treatment by 73 percent . . . these findings support the value of the GeneSight test,\u2019\u2019 according to the coverage decision.\n\nExcitement built in the mental health world that perhaps there was finally a scientific test that could help patients.\n\nBrown heard about the test from his psychiatrist, Susan Gerretson, of the Community Health Centers of the Rutland Region, and found out his federal insurance would pay for it.\n\nWhile his medications of lithium for bipolar disorder and the antidepressant Effexor were holding him steady, he was hardly in a happy place.\n\n\u201cI figured, Why not try it?\u201d he said.\n\nOf the five medications the test suggested he would respond best to, Brown had never tried two of them. After several months of discussion, Gerretson put him on one of those drugs, Fetzima.\n\nEven without the new drug, Brown says it was a challenging time: He turned 40, his old girlfriend called, and he quarreled with his mother.\n\nBut Fetzima \u201cwas a factor\u2019\u2019 in his breakdown, he believes. He paused during an interview this summer at the Brattleboro Retreat, a mental health treatment center, and gave a wry smile. \u201cIt sure didn\u2019t help.\u201d\n\nGerretson declined to talk specifically about Brown\u2019s case, citing privacy concerns. But she said in an e-mail that she believes GeneSight can be helpful as long as a doctor fully understands a patient\u2019s history and conducts his or her own research.\n\n\u201cI never believe what sales representatives try to sell me,\u2019\u2019 she wrote.\n\nYet critics of these tests say it\u2019s impossible for doctors \u2014 or anyone else \u2014 to truly evaluate many of the tests. GeneSight\u2019s proprietary formula for interpreting genetic information has never been independently assessed. The test examines genes well-known to play a role in antidepressant response, but it adds others not suppported by the same level of evidence, some researchers say.\n\nRobert Howland, associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh, wrote a paper last year concluding that the makers of the GeneSight test have overstated the findings of their studies, making outside review more urgent.\n\n\u201cIndependent assessment . . . of the GeneSight test is necessary to overcome the appearance of bias,\u2019\u2019 said Howland.\n\nBut Assurex\u2019s Dechairo said if the company didn\u2019t do the research, no one would. The company has 12 ongoing studies not only for depression, he said, but for bipolar disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia and other medical issues.\n\nTo reach patients, the company markets its tests to the psychiatry world, in part by paying psychiatrists and nurses to talk favorably about their test to peers. The practice is not new in medicine, but, unlike the drug industry, most genetic test makers need not disclose which doctors they pay because they\u2019re not FDA-regulated.\n\nCatherine Poulos, a psychiatric nurse practitioner at East End Mental Health in Hampton Bays, N.Y., advertises the GeneSight test on her website, saying it allows her practice \u201cto use the right drug at the right dose.\u201d But nowhere does it say on the site that she is paid to speak favorably to peers about the test; a patient would have to look at her Linkedin profile to see that. Poulos declined to speak on the record to NECIR.\n\nBut some consultants who use the tests say they do so because they believe in it, not because they get paid.\n\n\u201cIt adds clarity,\u2019\u2019 said Chris Bojrab, a psychiatrist and president of Indiana Health Group, a large behavioral health practice and a GeneSight consultant. He discloses his financial relationship with GeneSight on his website.\n\nThe FDA loophole that allows unregulated tests on the market dates back more than three decades to when the FDA began regulating diagnostic tests. At the time, the agency exempted what was then a small group of tests that were developed, manufactured, and used in a single lab, such as in a hospital.\n\nStarting in the mid-2000s, for-profit companies have used the exemption to develop thousands of complex genetic tests now in the marketplace without FDA review.\n\nThe FDA announced plans last year to regulate these tests over the next nine years. However, there is no timeline to finalize the rules, according to an FDA spokeswoman, and the process is likely to take years.\n\nCommercial labs and academic institutions are pushing back against regulation, arguing the rules will stifle innovation and delay life-saving tests getting to patients. Regardless of the outcome of the fight, many academic scientists say this new era in testing needs independent study. They question if the tests are adding unnecessary costs to health care.\n\n\u201cThese companies look at a very small subset of a very large number of factors\u2019\u2019 that go into treating patients, said Bruce Cohen, a psychiatry professor at Harvard Medical School and director of the program for neuropsychiatric research at McLean Hospital in Belmont. \u201cPeople are making decisions based on unproven tests.\u201d\n\nBrown\u2019s decision was to go back to old medications. For him, the GeneSight test felt more like \u201ca cool piece of science fiction\u201d than a breakthrough. Still living in his mother\u2019s house, he remains determined to rebuild his life.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to figure it out another way,\u201d he said.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "A very strong point for the story.

He is an associate professor at the department of investigational cancer therapeutics at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston.\n\n\"Patients only had one week of exposure to the bacteria, but even with that limited exposure we saw quite interesting and, in some patients, clinically meaningful activity,\" Janku said.\n\nClostridium novyi has been linked to human illness. In 2000, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a handful of drug users in the United Kingdom fell ill or died after their injection sites became infected with the bacteria.\n\nThe strain used in this clinical trial, Clostridium novyi-NT, had been weakened to prevent it from producing its toxin, which can be lethal in humans, Janku said. The NT stands for \"non-toxic.\"\n\nClostridium novyi flourishes in low-oxygen environments. Researchers thought this might make the bacteria a prime candidate for cancer fighting, by keeping the infection focused on the tumor site.\n\n\"Normal tissues, even if they are low on oxygen, they always have enough oxygen to not allow this bacteria to germinate and proliferate,\" Janku explained. \"Cancerous tissue is low in oxygen, most often in the center of the cancers.\"\n\nTo test whether the bacteria could help fight cancer, researchers injected the tumors of 24 patients with a single dose of Clostridium novyi-NT, ranging from 10,000 to 3 million spores.\n\nFifteen of the patients had sarcoma, two patients had melanoma, and seven had a variety of cancers, the researchers said.\n\nThe scientists expected Clostridium novyi-NT to help fight the tumor in two ways.\n\nFirst, the bacterial infection itself could cause direct destruction of the tumor cells, Janku said.\n\n\"If that happens, it actually helps to increase the presence of tumor-specific antigens, which are proteins that make a tumor more obvious to the immune system,\" Janku said. \"It can prime the immune system to attack the cancer.\"\n\nThe bacteria also could activate the immune system to fight the cancer even if the infection didn't kill off tumor cells, Janku added.\n\nPatients in this clinical trial were left with the bacterial infection for one week, and then everyone was given antibiotics to kill off the Clostridium novyi-NT, Janku said.\n\n\"Clostridium is actually quite susceptible to antibiotics,\" Janku noted.\n\nThe bacteria germinated in the cancers of 11 out of the 24 patients, with tumor cells dying off as a result.\n\nTumor shrinkage of greater than 10 percent was observed in 23 percent of patients. However, Janku said this could be an underestimate since the infection causes surrounding tissue to become inflamed, making the lesion appear larger than it actually is.\n\nFollowing bacterial therapy, cancer stabilized in 21 patients. When both injected and uninjected lesions were included, the stable disease rate was 86 percent, the researchers reported.\n\nThe potential for Clostridium novyi-NT to prompt an immune response against cancer is intriguing, said Sacha Gnjatic, who is associate director of the Human Immune Monitoring Center at Mount Sinai in New York City.\n\n\"That's where the promise of this type of therapy lies. You would expect that the injected lesion would have some type of response because you're disrupting the tumor cells,\" Gnjatic said. \"What would be interesting is if this could prime an immune response that would eventually also take care of the non-injected tumors. That's the holy grail of immunotherapy.\"\n\nJanku said he's particularly excited by the ability of the bacteria to battle sarcomas, which are cancers that occur in bone, muscle and soft tissues.\n\n\"Classic immunotherapy which is now approved or being heavily investigated doesn't seem to be working for a majority of sarcomas,\" Janku explained.\n\nResearchers have moved on to the next phase, in which patients taking the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab (Keytruda) will also be treated with a single injection of Clostridium novyi-NT, Janku said. The researchers suspect the two therapies used in combination will create a strong immune response against cancers.\n\nHowever, they will have to keep an eye on potential side effects from Clostridium novyi-NT, Janku added.\n\nTwo patients treated with the heaviest dose of 3 million spores of Clostridium novyi-NT fell ill with sepsis and/or gas gangrene, leading researchers to set the maximum tolerated dose at 1 million spores.\n\nResearchers also found the bacteria in the bloodstream of a couple of patients, meaning that the infection will need to be carefully tracked, Janku said.\n\n\"That didn't result in clostridium seeding anywhere else outside the injected region, but it's a theoretical possibility since we were able to detect it in the blood culture of one or two patients,\" Janku said.\n\nPatients also could be susceptible to immune response side effects, such as low blood pressure or fever, he added.\n\nThe trial results were to be presented Sunday at the International Cancer Immunotherapy Conference, in New York City. The meeting is jointly sponsored by the Cancer Research Institute, the Association for Cancer Immunotherapy, the European Academy of Tumor Immunology, and the American Association for Cancer Research.\n\nResearch presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more about cancer treatment.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story quoted two researchers who were involved in the trial, with no independent sources.

Botulinum toxin type A is sold under different brands, but it\u2019s best known by the Allergan brand-name Botox.\n\nBotox gained fame for smoothing aging skin \u2014 by blocking nerve signals and relaxing muscles under the skin \u2014 but the product has a number of medical uses. In the U.S., Botox is approved to treat conditions like chronic migraine, excessive sweating and certain symptoms of MS: overactive bladder and muscles spasms in the arms.\n\nThe new study, published in the journal Neurology, tested the effects of Botox injections on MS-related arm tremors, which affect up to two-thirds of people with MS. Researchers found that when they gave injections to 23 patients, the treatment typically eased their tremors and improved their writing ability.\n\nRight now, there\u2019s no good way to treat MS arm tremors, said Nicholas G. LaRocca, vice-president of healthcare delivery and policy research at the National MS Society. Physical therapy and exercise have been studied, but are usually not very effective, said LaRocca, who was not involved in the new study. Surgery is sometimes used in severe cases, but it\u2019s risky and may not even have lasting benefits.\n\n\u201cExploring new treatments is important, and it\u2019s heartening to see there\u2019s some promise here,\u201d LaRocca said of the current findings. But there\u2019s still a lot to be learned, he cautioned in an interview.\n\n\u201cThis study is fairly preliminary, and it had a small number of patients,\u201d LaRocca said. Larger studies, of more-diverse groups of MS patients, are needed, he said.\n\nThe study\u2019s lead researcher agreed on the need for more work. \u201cThere are several questions that need to be answered by doing larger and longer-term studies,\u201d Dr. Anneke van der Walt, a neurologist at Royal Melbourne Hospital in Australia, said in an email.\n\nOne is how long the benefits of repeat Botox injections might last: this study tested the effects of just one Botox treatment over three months.\n\nIn real life, the injections would have to be repeated every few months, or possibly every six months for some people, according to van der Walt. Another question is whether the side effects change over time. Muscle weakness was the most common side effect in this study, van der Walt said. It affected 42 percent of the study patients, though it went away within two weeks.\n\nMuscle weakness is a potential concern in MS patients, LaRocca noted, since that problem often comes with the disease itself.\n\nThe study included 23 MS patients with mild to moderate arm tremors. Each patient received a round of Botox injections and a round of placebo injections (containing saline), three months apart. Half of the patients got the Botox first, the other half the placebo.\n\nOn average, the patients\u2019 tremor \u201cscores\u201d had gone from a 5 to a 3 six weeks after Botox treatment \u2014 which essentially means moving from \u201cmoderate\u201d to \u201cmild,\u201d LaRocca said.

The United States has banned or restricted the sale of ephedra products because of concerns about possible complications, such as heart attack, stroke and even death, related to its use as a weight-loss supplement.\n\nThe authors discuss their findings in the Aug. 16 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nThe 2009 H1N1 (\"swine flu\") pandemic sparked influenza cases around the globe, resulting in nearly 18,000 deaths, the authors said.\n\nPer World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, in most instances, Tamiflu was the treatment of choice, where it was available. However, it is often out of reach in less developed parts of the world, such as rural China, where traditional herbal medicines are a likely default treatment.\n\nThe M-Y flu preparation is composed of 12 herbs: ephedrae, zhimu, qinghao, shigao, yinhua, huangqin, chaoxingren, lianqiao, bohe, zhebeimu, niubangzi and gancao.\n\nTo compare the relative effectiveness of M-Y and Tamiflu in treating H1N1 influenza, the authors focused on 410 previously healthy patients who were diagnosed with a \"very mild\" form of the illness.\n\nThe men and women were relatively young, with an average age of 19. They were being treated in 11 different medical facilities across four Chinese provinces during the height of the pandemic, between July and November of 2009, to prevent spreading the flu, not because their symptoms were severe.\n\nWithin 72 hours of the onset of symptoms, the patients were assigned to one of four five-day treatment groups. One group was given 75 milligrams of Tamiflu twice a day in capsule form; a second group received 200 milliliters of M-Y four times a day in liquid form; a third group took the same dosages of Tamiflu and M-Y together; and a fourth group received no treatment.\n\nAll of the herbs were screened for quality, and the M-Y mixture was deemed to meet Chinese safety standards.\n\nThe results: Both M-Y and Tamiflu were effective at eliminating fever, whether administered on their own or in combination.\n\nAll three approaches helped to resolve fever sooner than no intervention whatsoever, the authors said, noting it appeared that fever dissipated fastest when M-Y and Tamiflu were given together. However, none of the treatment methods appeared to be superior in terms of overall viral control, and side effects were minimal in all cases.\n\nEven though the ephedra-containing herbal is not readily available in the United States, the M-Y herbal formula is available in many countries besides China, including Korea, Japan, India and Germany, the study authors noted.\n\nDuffy MacKay, vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs at the Council for Responsible Nutrition, which represents the dietary supplement industry, believes that fears over ephedra's use as a weight-control agent have overlooked \"its more traditional and much safer\" role as a medicine against lung inflammation.\n\nMacKay said that in China, traditional medicine is \"seamlessly integrated\" into everyday medical practice.\n\n\"Here in the U.S., we do things differently,\" he said. \"We have our prescription drugs on the one hand, and then we have dietary supplements on the other.\"\n\nBut, MacKay continued, \"it should also be understood that these two treatments actually work very differently. Tamiflu works to stop viral replication. But the herbal formula is working on symptoms to help people become more comfortable. And those are two very different goals,\" he noted.\n\n\"So our advice,\" MacKay added, \"is that because H1N1 can be very serious, it's very important to see your doctor.

But Tirpak's physician, Dr. Mary Laughlin, turned to something deemed medical waste until recently: umbilical cord blood.\n\nCord blood is rich in stem cells and easier to match than adult bone marrow because the immune cells are not developed. Also, patients can get the treatment in about three weeks -- as opposed to six to eight for bone marrow from an adult donor, said Laughlin, founder and medical director of the Cleveland Cord Blood Center.\n\n\"That can be a critical time interval for a patient who is in remission,\" she said, noting that doctors often fear a patient's relapse while awaiting the transplant.\n\nTraditionally, patients with leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma have first tried to find an adult bone marrow donor either from a close relative or from a national bone marrow registry. But the registry's more than 12 million donors meet the needs of only about 60 percent of Caucasians in the United States and only 5 to 15 percent of minorities, who are underrepresented. Even siblings are not a sure thing, with the chance of matching a brother or sister only 25 percent.\n\nNathan Mumford, who is African-American, tried to find a bone marrow donor after his leukemia was diagnosed not long after he graduated from college.\n\n\"We went through that process, and nobody had a match. Siblings are the best matches. My brother or my sister wasn't a match. My friends, aunts, uncles, cousins, nobody was a match. So, couldn't go that route,\" Mumford said.\n\nAt that point, Mumford said, his choices were to continue chemotherapy and live for, maybe, another year and a half. Or he could try a cord blood stem cell transplant.\n\n\"That was an opportunity,\" said Mumford, who survived Hodgkin's disease as a child. \"That was a chance for me to live. I'm not a quitter. I've never been a quitter, so I wasn't going to quit.\"\n\nMumford received a cord blood stem cell transplant in November 2004. In such transplants, patients have chemotherapy, radiation or both to kill the cancer cells and to suppress the immune system so that the new stem cells are not rejected. Then, the stem cells are injected into the patient's body and travel to the bone marrow cavities, where they create new, healthy marrow. Mumford, who's now 30, says he's never felt better.\n\n\"I just feel amazing,\" he said. \"I have a lot of energy, and I'm just excited about it.\"\n\nMumford lives in Cleveland and runs the Karen E. Mumford Foundation. The nonprofit, named for his mother, who died of breast cancer while he was being treated, provides emotional and financial assistance to cancer patients.\n\nTirpak and Mumford represent a growing number of patients taking advantage of stem cells from cord blood, which can be used in patients with leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma. Cord blood transplants among unrelated donors have risen from 1 percent in 2001 to 24 percent last year, Laughlin says.\n\nNationally, more than 200 hospitals accept cord blood donations. Parents must decide before birth whether to bank a child's cord blood. If they do, it's collected immediately after birth, processed, registered in a national database and kept frozen. If collected and stored for private use, the procedure can cost as much as $2,000 or more, plus annual storage fees.\n\nPublic blood banks collect and store the cord blood free of charge. Those parents get their own child's blood unless it has already been given out as a match for someone else. In that case, other matching blood is made available free of charge.\n\nCord blood stem cell transplants have the same risks as adult bone marrow transplants: the new blood rejecting the host, called graft-versus-host disease. And patients still must endure months of recovery. Well worth it, say Mumford and Tirpak, who received her stem cell injection two years ago.\n\n\"Such a tiny few drops of blood cells really give new birth to people,\" Tirpak said.\n\nOn Saturday, her husband, Jake, finally wore the suit he had been saving for his wife's funeral -- at a family wedding.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The online story quotes only one physician.\u00a0 Another independent expert might have raised some of the questions that we have raised throughout this review.

By introducing the immune system to a potential future enemy, antibodies against that invader are ready to attack when the time comes. In this case, the vaccine introduces a piece of the heroin molecule to the immune system. In response, this protective system manufactures antibodies to the drug, including the components that cause the high.\n\nAs a result, those molecules never reach the brain, preventing the euphoria that may have otherwise resulted. The absence of a high could help recovering heroin users resist the temptation to relapse, the researchers say.\n\nThe current study of the vaccine, published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, follows eight years of laboratory research and studies in rodents that indicated the compound could neutralize heroin at different doses.\n\nHere, the Scripps investigators, working with researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University, tested the vaccine on four rhesus monkeys. The animals were given three doses of the vaccine, which elicited a successful immune response that neutralized heroin given at varying doses. The high-blocking effects of the vaccine were strongest during the first month but continued for more than eight months. The researchers did not observe any harmful side effects from the intervention.\n\nRelated: Opioid epidemic and overdose deaths blamed on pharma in Ohio lawsuit\n\nTwo of the animals had been exposed to the vaccine seven months before for a similar pilot study.

Many of the injuries are related to sports.\n\nIn most cases, concussion symptoms last only a few days. But up to 25 percent of young patients \"go on to have these prolonged headaches, fatigue, nausea, and those symptoms can last sometimes one to four months,\" Hicks says.\n\nAnd, right now, there's no way to know which kids are going to have long-term problems, he says.\n\n\"Parents often say that their biggest concern is, 'When is my child going to be back to normal again?' \" Hicks says. \"And that's something we have a very difficult time predicting.\"\n\nHicks and a team of researchers have been looking for an objective test that might help.\n\nThey knew that, after a concussion, injured brain cells try to heal themselves. As a part of this process, brain cells release tiny fragments of genetic material called microRNAs. Some of these fragments eventually turn up in blood and even in saliva.\n\nThe team did an experiment that involved 50 concussion patients between the ages of 7 and 18.\n\n\"When they came to our medical center and received the diagnosis of concussion, we evaluated them with some standard survey-based tools and then we also got a sample of their saliva,\" Hicks says. Most samples were collected about a week after the injury.\n\nThe team measured levels of many different microRNAs in the samples, and eventually they identified a handful that let them predict how long symptoms would last. They also identified one microRNA that predicted which children would have a specific concussion symptom: difficulties with memory and problem solving, Hicks says.\n\nA saliva test could greatly improve care for young people who don't have obvious symptoms of a concussion, says Manish Bhomia, an adjunct assistant professor at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md.\n\n\"A lot of children get mild concussion and oftentimes it goes ignored,\" he says.\n\nA reliable lab test would help ensure that children who have a head injury don't go back to school, or to the soccer field, before their brain has healed, Bhomia says.\n\nAnd microRNAs offer a promising way to assess concussions in adults as well as children, says Bhomia, whose research involves a range of \"biomarkers\" for traumatic brain injury.\n\nBut saliva may not be the best place to measure microRNAs, Bhomia says.

And, when suspected trouble foods were reintroduced into the diet, two-thirds of the children experienced a relapse in symptoms.\n\n\"A strictly supervised restricted elimination diet is a valuable instrument to assess whether ADHD is induced by food,\" wrote the study authors. \"We think that dietary intervention should be considered in all children with ADHD, provided parents are willing to follow a diagnostic restricted elimination diet for a five-week period, and provided expert supervision is available,\" they concluded.\n\nResults of the study are published in the Feb. 5 issue of The Lancet.\n\nADHD is a common childhood disorder, according to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). Children with ADHD have trouble paying attention, focusing and can be hyperactive. Parents have long suspected that sugary foods might be a culprit in inducing symptoms, but there's not a lot of evidence to support this theory, according to the NIMH. However, food additives and preservatives have recently been singled out as possibly having an effect on children's behavior, though the evidence isn't yet conclusive.\n\nSince some children have negative physical reactions to certain foods -- such as eczema, asthma and gastrointestinal problems -- that affect different organ systems, it has been suggested that foods may also affect the brain in a way that results in adverse behavior, according to information in the study.\n\nTo test this theory, the researchers recruited 100 children from Belgium and the Netherlands. The children were between the ages of 4 and 8, and all had been diagnosed with ADHD. Most of the children were boys.\n\nThe children were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group was placed on the restrictive elimination diet, and the other group served as a control group and received advice on healthy eating.\n\nThe restrictive diet began with a diet called the \"few foods diet,\" which includes just rice, meat, vegetables, pears and water. The researchers then complemented this diet with certain foods, such as potatoes, fruits and wheat. The restrictive diet lasted for five weeks.\n\nDuring the next four weeks, kids in the restricted diet group received two food challenge diets, in which certain foods were reintroduced into the diet. The researchers selected foods that were considered both low- and high-IgG foods.\n\nIgG is an antibody made by the immune system that some alternative medicine practitioners believe is linked to food hypersensitivities; however, IgG testing is controversial among many mainstream physicians and even some naturopaths, according to background information in the study.\n\nSome complementary medicine practices test for IgG and recommend eliminating foods high in IgG, explained Dr. Jaswinder Ghuman, who wrote an accompanying editorial in the same issue of the journal.\n\nForty-one children completed the restrictive phase of the diet. Of those, 78 percent had a reduction in their ADHD symptoms, compared with no improvement in the controls. Nine children (22 percent) didn't respond to the diet. On an ADHD symptom scale that ranges from 0 to 72 points, with a higher score indicating more severe symptoms, the average reduction was 24 points, according to the study.\n\nThirty children who had shown a response on the restrictive diet went on to the challenge test. Nineteen of those children had a relapse in symptoms on the challenge test. What's more, it didn't appear to matter if the children with challenged with a low- or high-IgG food.\n\n\"Measuring IgG levels in kids doesn't seem helpful,\" Ghuman said, but it does look as if the elimination diet may help some children.\n\n\"If parents have noticed that a child's behavior seems to get worse with certain foods, it may be worth considering,\" said Ghuman, who is an associate professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at the University of Arizona in Tucson.\n\n\"But, for this diet to work, you have to be very consistent with it, and you have to pay attention to nutrition.

Hundreds of patients who received the model have had to undergo new operations to replace it. Also, scar tissue often builds up around intravenous wires, a process that can make removing and replacing them difficult or dangerous.\n\nDr. Bardy said in a telephone interview that the deaths of several patients many years ago because of wire-related injuries were a factor in his interest in developing the new device.\n\n\u201cYou are looking at a therapy that can avert, we hope, complications and be as effective,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the study published Wednesday, Dr. Bardy and others reported that the new device had undergone several successful initial trials, including one in which it was used for a year in about 60 patients.\n\nThe device is being developed by Cameron Health, a small company in San Clemente, Calif., that was co-founded by Dr. Bardy.

So, the researchers theorized that the poor performance of the supplements may simply reflect the overwhelming power of the medications.\n\nStudy author Daan Kromhout, from the division of human nutrition at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, is to present the findings Sunday at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Stockholm; the study will appear online in the New England Journal of Medicine simultaneously.\n\nIn the study, researchers focused on a group of more than 4,800 Dutch heart attack patients between the ages of 60 and 80, slightly more than three-quarters of whom were men.\n\nAll had experienced a heart attack at some point in the decade leading up to the study, and all were taking blood pressure medications, anti-clotting drugs and statins.\n\nAt the study's start, the patients were instructed to consume (over a period lasting a little over three years) one of four different types of margarines: one supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids; one supplemented with the plant-derived ALA; one supplemented with both omega-3 fatty acids and ALA; and one with no supplements.\n\nThe amount of supplementation added to the various margarines was deemed to be \"low-dose.\" During the study, the patients consumed an average of 18.8 grams of margarine per day, which meant ingestion of an average of 226 milligrams of EPA combined with 150 milligrams of DHA omega-3 fatty acids and/or 1.9 grams of ALA.\n\nBy the study's end, almost 14 percent of the heart attack patients had experienced another \"major cardiovascular event,\" with some cases ending in death.\n\nNone of the low-dose supplements seemed to stave off such events in most of the patients. One exception appeared to be among women ingesting ALA; researchers saw a 27 percent reduction in the risk for further cardiac complications, although that reduction did not quite reach statistical significance.\n\n\"The bottom-line finding of the Alpha Omega Trial is that [omega]-3 fatty acids did not reduce the primary endpoint major cardiovascular events,\" Kromhout said, noting that the ALA finding needs further confirmation.\n\nDr. Murray A. Mittleman, director of the cardiovascular epidemiology research unit at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said he was \"not that surprised by these results.\"\n\n\"Other studies have shown no benefit from omega-3, other than specifically protecting against cardiac death linked to arrhythmia among patients who have just survived a heart attack,\" Mittleman noted. It is during this acute post-attack period, he explained, when patients are most vulnerable to a subsequent event.\n\n\"But here, in some cases the patients they looked at are years following their first heart attack when they start taking these supplements,\" he stressed. \"So, that's a big difference in what kind of patient they're examining. And they're also not just looking at preventable fatalities but all heart-related events that follow. And on top of that, the supplement doses they use here are very low, much lower than those used in prior studies.\"\n\n\"So it might be big differences in study design that account for this new finding,\" Mittleman cautioned. \"In any case, I would say this is absolutely worth further investigation.\"\n\nDr. Gregg C. Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, agreed.\n\n\"It is possible that improvements in other treatments for heart attack patients have made fish oil supplementation less important for reducing cardiovascular risk,\" he acknowledged. \"But it's also possible that the different dosing used in this study relative to previous work made a difference in the outcome. The dosing here may have been just too low, whereas higher doses given immediately following an initial heart attack might have been protective.\"\n\n\"So I would say,\" Fonarow added, \"that this is by no means the final word regarding omega-3s and cardiovascular health.\"\n\nFor more on omega-3 fatty acids, visit the National Institutes of Health.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "\u00a0The story included comments from several individuals without direct ties to the study reported on but with active research programs examining the potential of benefit from omega-3 fatty acids.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "(CNN) Sometimes, Ellis Glover would be forced to leave her friends and sit at a lunch table where no one was eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.\n\n\"I wanted to sit with my good, good friends, but I couldn't,\" the 10-year-old said. \"If you're a kid and you have a food allergy, it's harder on you. You're missing out on a lot of stuff other children can have. I always want to try peanut stuff.\"\n\nMom Monica Glover said the family discovered Ellis' peanut allergy when she was about 3. The tipoff: a skin reaction around her mouth after she was given food with a small amount of peanuts in it. \"We were lucky to have discovered it that way. That was a mild reaction,\" Glover said, and a doctor confirmed the allergy through tests.\n\nThe discovery was \"distressing,\" Glover said. Accidental exposure to peanuts has happened, resulting in \"severe stomach cramps and vomiting,\" she said. \"Essentially, we have to live in fear all the time of Ellis being inadvertently exposed to peanuts and having a reaction that is potentially life-threatening.\"\n\nGlover seized the opportunity to participate in a study on the safety and effectiveness of an experimental treatment that could give her daughter protection against accidental exposure to peanuts. Despite the risk, it was \"a gift,\" she said, adding that her family hoped their efforts might help \"lots of other children.\"\n\nThe risk paid off: Two-thirds of the kids in the study were able to eat the equivalent of two peanuts without any symptoms after following the months-long experimental treatment regimen, the researchers found.\n\nEllis is one of the majority of children for whom the treatment works. \"It's been a huge success,\" her mother said.\n\n\"It does not make the allergy to go away,\" Vickery said. \"The purpose is not to get them to be no longer peanut allergic and allow them to eat whatever they want.\"\n\n\"I'm telling patients when I see them that my hope is that patients will have access by late next summer, something like that,\" Vickery said. He added that although the study proved the treatment's effectiveness and safety only in children, adults would probably benefit in the same way.\n\nTo test the experimental therapy, 66 research centers in 10 countries recruited 551 participants who ranged in age from 4 to 55 and who all had a peanut allergy. Most -- 499 participants -- were between the ages of 4 and 17.\n\n\"We were extremely well-informed about the entire process,\" Glover said. \"You start at a super low dose and work your way up. You take it at the hospital under observation. Then, you take it at home every day. \"\n\nThree-quarters of the study participants were given the treatment in increasing amounts every two weeks until reaching maintenance, when they received the equivalent of one peanut daily. The remainder of the participants were given a placebo. At the conclusion of the study after a year, all of the participants faced an \"exit food challenge\": They ate, under a doctor's supervision, the equivalent of two peanuts.\n\nTwo-thirds of the treatment participants were able to tolerate this exit dose without a severe reaction. Half tolerated even twice that amount: a four-peanut dose.\n\nOverall, participants experienced fewer side effects during the study than the researchers had anticipated. \"It's intuitive that that process would trigger some allergic symptoms in many patients,\" Vickery said. A third completed the study with no more than mild side effects, such as stomachache.\n\nEllis experienced stomach cramps and vomiting multiple times during the study, usually on days when her dose was increased to raise her tolerance. \"Having stomach cramps did not feel very good,\" she said. Still, she usually vomited, and the cramps passed quickly.\n\nOnce, she felt her throat constrict, and \"it was harder for me to breathe,\" she said. She'd gone into anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction. The hospital staff reacted immediately and gave her a shot of epinephrine. \"I felt safe with all the doctors and nurses around me. They can help you get through it,\" she said.\n\nA little more than 11% of the children dropped out of the study due to severe side effects. Among children receiving the treatment, 10% required rescue epinephrine during the exit challenge, compared with 53% in the placebo group.\n\n\"These treatments really have the potential to transform people's lives,\" Vickery said, \"and I have seen it happen firsthand: the sense of relief [families] get when a child becomes desensitized.\"\n\nTrying to be 'bite safe'\n\n\"It's what a lot of families call trying to be 'bite safe.' it's not that you're curing the allergy; it's not that you're going to be able to eat peanut butter sandwiches,\" said Sicherer, who was not involved in the study. \"It's really just to have a better threshold so that if you accidentally ate something that had a little bit of peanut in it, maybe you wouldn't have a reaction or the reaction wouldn't be so bad.\"\n\nThough the immunotherapy treatment is simply a matter of gradually increasing your tolerance to peanuts, you could have a severe reaction at home. \"This is not something to try at home,\" Sicherer said.\n\nAimmune has made peanut into a \"pharmaceutical-grade\" product, he said. \"Most people think of it as medicinalized food.\" Doctors and patients both know exactly how much you're getting, he said, \"and that's important because if you're reactive to, say, a 50th of a peanut, you don't want to have a mistake where you're suddenly getting a 10th of peanut.\"\n\nAssuming the treatment wins FDA approval, Sicherer said, the conversation between doctors and patients will be, \"Is it better to just avoid the food and ask a lot of questions at restaurants and be real careful, or do something like this and still don't eat the food and ask the questions in the restaurant, but at least know you have a bit of a safety valve?\"\n\nThere are more than a few caveats when it comes to the treatment regimen. For one, it's \"a commitment,\" he said. You cannot take a dose before exercising, and you can't skip doses, or you might have a severe reaction when you pick it up again.\n\nGlover noted, \"It's somewhat disruptive. You have to do it every day. Generally, we would take it after dinner.\" After giving the medicine, she added, parents must carefully monitor their children, preventing them from becoming too active or too hot.\n\nSicherer said, \"The family that does this really, really, really has to be a rule follower. It's not easy.\" It would still be worth it to many, he said.\n\nIf this ends up being the first approved treatment, if it is covered by insurance and if details of whom it works for best were all worked out and the risks and benefits were clear, \"that would be so amazing, because we haven't really had anything like that before,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not everything we would hope for, but it's still fantastic to be able to raise someone's threshold from a teeny tiny amount of peanut to a couple of peanuts or more,\" said Sicherer, who believes that other allergy products will be developed in time: \"I can tell my patients that this might be the right thing for them, but if not, we're looking at things that might be easier and better down the road.\"\n\nGlover acknowledges that \"it's not a perfect solution. I would say it's been some work to go through this study, just in terms of a time commitment.\" Still, if it had taken twice the amount of time, she would have done it: \"It's peace of mind.\"\n\nEven though she dislikes the medicine's taste, Ellis also believes it is worth it. \"It's definitely better,\" she would say to another kid with peanut allergy: \"You know you can be around your friends when they have peanut butter on them.\"", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story includes several expert sources, including a doctor who was not involved in the study and who does not appear to be funded by potential treatment-makers.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "WASHINGTON (Jan. 11, 2015) -- Symptoms of mild to minimal depression were associated with early indicators of heart disease in a research letter published today in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, but the study found regular exercise seems to reduce the adverse cardiovascular consequences of depression.\n\nDepression has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease and other physical ailments, and depression is commonly associated with worse outcomes for patients with heart disease and other conditions. In addition, as many as 20 percent of people hospitalized with a heart attack report symptoms of depression, while patients with heart disease have three times the risk of developing depression compared to the general population.\n\nResearchers from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta set out to learn more about the relationship between depressive symptoms and heart disease.

For people who worked out more, no additional benefits were observed.\n\nThe study could not prove a cause-and-effect relationship between exercise and the risk of depression, but the authors say it strongly suggests one\u2014especially because they controlled for other potential factors, including age, gender, social support, smoking, drinking and body mass index.\n\nIf their hypothesis is right, they say, 12% of depression cases could be prevented if everyone got just one hour of exercise a week.\n\nThat exercise doesn\u2019t have to be intense, either, they say.

However there is no data available in Australian adolescents beyond 24 months post-surgery.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about a group of adolescents with severe obesity and significant health and psychological problems related to their increased weight \u2013 this is not for everyone,\u201d says corresponding author and Paediatric Endocrinologist Dr Alexia Pe\u00f1a, who is a Senior Lecturer with the University of Adelaide\u2019s Robinson Research Institute.\n\nThe study found that weight and BMI improved significantly at all follow-up times following surgery from three months through to 45 months and, in some cases, as long as five years. BMI loss was between 7.1 and 14.7 kg/m2.\n\n\u201cThe median BMI reduction of 10 kg/m2 with the lap band is a good result when compared to BMI reduction using the few medications available or lifestyle measures, which is around 1-3 kg/m2,\u201d says Dr Pe\u00f1a. \u201cLap band surgery is reversible and allows time for adolescents to mature to make a more informed decision on a permanent surgical procedure if required later on in life. This is not the case for other surgeries currently offered for obesity management.\n\n\u201cIt is also important that teenagers undergoing this surgery have access to an experienced surgeon as part of a multidisciplinary paediatric team of doctors and Health professionals to ensure there is long-term regular follow-up.\u201d\n\nPaediatric surgeon Mr Sanjeev Khurana, who did all the lap band surgeries between 2009 and 2013, says lap band surgery is a reversible surgical procedure that can be safely used in teens with severe obesity.\n\n\u201cAlthough gastric banding has been controversial and is currently less used in adults with severe obesity, lap band surgery is one of the most studied surgeries for obesity management, has a high safety record and can be a temporary option to manage severe obesity during adolescence,\u201d says Mr Khurana, who is also a Senior Lecturer in the University of Adelaide\u2019s Discipline of Paediatrics.\n\n\u201cOur findings support lap band surgery as a safe and effective option for management of adolescents with severe obesity \u2013 provided it is performed by an experienced surgeon and managed afterwards in a paediatric multidisciplinary environment with regular follow-up until adulthood.\u201d", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Funders are not mentioned in the release although that information is provided in the text of the journal article.

Traditionally, it has measured variables like the speed and variability (pulse) of blood flowing through the arteries. But those measurements haven't been enough to accurately detect concussion.\n\nFor this study, researchers used an advanced version of TCD ultrasound to get a more complete picture of just how the blood moves through the middle cerebral artery, one of the three major arteries in the brain.\n\nResearchers compared a group of 66 high school athletes in contact sports who had been recently diagnosed with a concussion to a control group of 169 high school student athletes from both contact and non-contact sports. Examples of collision sports included in the study were football, soccer, basketball, hockey, water polo and lacrosse. The non-contact sports included were cheerleading, cross country, cycling, tennis and track. Both the control and concussion groups were approximately 30 percent female.\n\nEach of the concussed athletes had their brain blood flow measured with the advanced ultrasound headset within an average of six days after the injury. They were also given a general concussion evaluation and had their blood pressure checked.\n\nThe study found that the advanced version of TCD ultrasound was able to differentiate between healthy and concussed athletes 83 percent of the time. This is in contrast to traditional TCD ultrasound measurements like change in cerebral blood flow reactivity which differentiated between the two 60 percent of the time, average blood flow speed which differentiated 55 percent of the time and blood flow resistance which differentiated 53 percent of the time.\n\n\"This research suggests that this advanced form of ultrasound may provide a more accurate diagnosis of concussion,\" said Hamilton. \"While more research is needed, the hope is such a tool could one day be used on the sidelines to help determine more quickly whether an athlete needs further testing.\"\n\n\"This important work provides insight into a tool that may yet prove useful in the recognition and management of concussion,\" said Jeffrey Kutcher, MD, FAAN, with the The Sports Neurology Clinic in Brighton, Michigan. \"The potential of having an accessible technology that detects a physiological change following brain trauma is very exciting. However, what these detected blood flow changes mean to a patient's clinical care is still unclear.\"\n\n\"This is an important area of research. Testing of the TCD technique at the sideline at the time of injury will be an important next step to determine its ultimate utility,\" said Randolph S.

Longo tested the impact of fasting for five consecutive days every month, believing that when the body thinks it's in a state of fasting, it shuts down and goes into standby mode.\n\n\"As cells are killed and the body goes into standby, your stem cells switch on,\" says Longo. Once switched on, the stem cells can regenerate the lost cells and organ mass -- leaving you shiny and new.\n\nWhen cells in the body age, their ratios change and Longo believes the body's reaction -- and repair methods -- to fasting help restore them to when you were younger. \"You're killing the bad cells and regenerating with cells that are more functional.\"\n\nPeople consumed approximately 1000 calories on day one and 725 calories for the remaining four days, but these numbers alone didn't determine the benefit.\n\n\"It's not just about reducing calories\", says Longo. His diet is designed to include specific percentages of protein, fat and carbohydrates, for maximum effect. The food items used, however, were specific to the trial and if translated to the public would involve designing meals made up of the right combination of nutrients.\n\nAfter three months, the benefits were a reduction in body weight as well as certain risk factors for cardiovascular disease. There was also an increase in certain stem cells in the body.\n\n\"The diet is turning on the body's ability to renew itself,\" says Longo.\n\nThe team have since calculated that following the diet every three months could provide enough of an impact as effects are thought to last up to six months.\n\nHow does it work?\n\n\"When you fast, you lower protein and certain amino acids and you control pathways [in the body],\" says Longo. The pathways he refers to are known as TOR, PKA and IGF pathways, which when controlled can switch on certain reactions inside the body causing immune cells to die and organs to shrink.\n\nThis activation, or reduction, of pathways is why the components of the diet, such a proteins, must also be controlled. \"You won't activate the correct pathways,\" says Longo.\n\n\"When you make IGF less active, it reduces risk factors linked to diabetes and cardiovascular disease,\" says Miguel Toribio-Mateas, Chairman of the British Association for Applied Nutrition and Nutritional Therapy.\n\nAccording to Toribio-Mateas, the results confirm earlier theories that \"some hormone-like growth factors that are required during development to grow, then become promoting agents of aging after development and sexual maturity have been reached\". He also believes the benefits are down to improved efficiency on a cellular level.\n\n\"Cells have a list of things to do every day,...like getting rid of toxins\" says Toribio-Mateas. If their workload is then disrupted by the need to store excess calories, certain products can accumulate. \"Regulating calories can have a very positive effect,\" he says. To him, diet underpins longevity.\n\nUnlike the 5-2 diet, which requires two days of low calories at any point in the week, Longo's diet involves fasting for five consecutive days, which requires much more willpower.\n\n\"Five days is safe: going on for longer is difficult to do outside of a clinic,\" says Longo.\n\nMore work needs to be done to fine tune the diet and determine meals that meet the criteria. Longo has since founded his own nutrition company. L-Nutra, to sell products that serve this purpose, which may be seen as a conflict of interest. He states that profits are going back into funding further research by his team.\n\n\"The results of the study are encouraging and warrant more research in this area,\" says Toribio-Mateas.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Whoo boy.

Men also had a risk reduction from frequently eating berries.\n\n\"For total flavonoids, the beneficial result was only in men. But, berries are protective in both men and women,\" said the study's lead author, Dr. Xiang Gao, a research scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health and an associate epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\n\n\"Berries could be a neuroprotective agent. People can include berries in their regular diet. There are no harmful effects from berry consumption, and they lower the risk of hypertension too,\" Gao added.\n\nResults of the study are published online April 4 in the journal Neurology.\n\nParkinson's disease is a degenerative condition that affects the central nervous system. It causes movement disorders, such as tremors, rigidity and balance problems. About 500,000 Americans have Parkinson's disease, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.\n\nFlavonoids are substances found in plant foods that help prevent damage to the body's cells, known as oxidative damage. Anthocyanins are a type of flavonoid plentiful in such berries as strawberries and blueberries.\n\nFor the study, the researchers reviewed nutrition and health data from almost 50,000 men enrolled in the Health Professional Follow-Up Study and more than 80,000 women participating in the Nurses' Health Study.\n\nThe researchers looked at dietary intake of five major flavonoid sources: tea, berries, apples, orange juice and red wine.\n\nOver 20 to 22 years of follow-up, 805 people developed Parkinson's disease -- 438 men and 367 women.\n\nWhen researchers compared those who ate the most flavonoids with those who ate the least, they found that only men saw a statistically significant benefit, lowering their risk of Parkinson's by 40 percent.\n\nGao said it wasn't clear why only men benefited from the extra flavonoid intake, but he noted that other studies have also found differences between men and women. Gao said it's not clear if there's a biological mechanism causing these differences, or another factor.\n\nBut, when the researchers looked at the dietary compounds individually, it was clear that berries could benefit both men and women, lowering the risk of Parkinson's disease by about 25 percent for those who had at least two servings of berries a week.\n\nGao said that anthocyanins protect the cells from oxidative damage and they also have an anti-inflammatory effect, which may be how berries help to reduce Parkinson's risk.\n\nThe study findings should be interpreted cautiously because the participants were mostly white professionals, and the results might not apply to other ethnic groups. Also, recollections of dietary intake may be faulty, and it's possible that other properties of fruits and vegetables might have influenced the results, the authors said.\n\nDr. Michael Okun, medical director of the National Parkinson Foundation, said, \"It is exciting to see research emerging about modifiable dietary issues that may affect the risk of getting diseases such as Parkinson's.\"\n\nBut, he added, it's important for people to realize that this research isn't applicable to people who already have the disease.\n\nHe also said it will be important to confirm these findings in other studies and learn the mechanism of how berries and other flavonoids appear to offer some protection against Parkinson's disease.\n\nLearn more about Parkinson's disease from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story quoted an independent expert, who cautioned that people who already have Parkinson\u2019s disease won\u2019t benefit from eating berries or other flavonoid-rich foods.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The study followed more than 1,600 people over the age of 60 for five years.

When it comes to the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease, the oral drug levodopa has long been considered the gold standard, improving quality of life and longevity. But as the disease progresses, the effects of the medication can partially wear off more quickly after each dose, leaving people to experience \u201coff\u201d time, which are periods of immobility related to temporary unresponsiveness to medication. Parkinson\u2019s symptoms, such as slowness and muscle rigidity, often make movement difficult. \u201cIf a person with Parkinson\u2019s disease can reduce their \u2018off\u2019 times, that can have a great impact on their everyday life,\u201d said study author Regina Katzenschlager, MD, of Danube Hospital, affiliated with the Medical University of Vienna, Austria. \u201cIn some patients in the trial, the insecurity of unpredictable periods of incapacity was completely alleviated.\u201d The drug apomorphine, first produced in 1865, was first used to treat advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease in the United States in 1950. Its use grew in the 1990s when European doctors starting using subcutaneous infusions of the drug to treat fluctuations in mobility that could not be controlled by the pills. Despite its use in many countries of the world, high-level evidence from randomized, blinded studies of its effectiveness and safety has up until now been lacking. In this phase III study, researchers recruited 107 people with advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease from 23 centers in seven countries. Participants were randomly selected to receive either apomorphine subcutaneous infusion or a placebo saline infusion. The infusion was administered over a period of 14 to 18 hours each day via a small portable pump similar to the sort used in the treatment of type 1 diabetes. The study found that those who were given apomorphine had a significantly greater reduction of \u201coff\u201d time than those who were given the placebo infusion, with, on average, 2.5 hours less \u201coff\u201d time per day, while those who received the placebo infusion had an average 30 minutes per day reduction in \u201coff\u201d time. This improvement was apparent within the first week of treatment. At the same time, for those who received apomorphine, there was an increase of \u201con\u201d time without the abnormal involuntary movements known as dyskinesias that are often observed with levodopa. Participants were also asked to evaluate how well they thought the treatment worked. Those who received apomorphine gave their treatment higher scores at week 12 than those who received the placebo infusion. In the apomorphine group, 71 percent of patients felt improved, compared to 18 percent on placebo, whereas 19 percent worsened on apomorphine compared to 45 percent on placebo. Apomorphine was generally well tolerated and there were no serious side effects. \u201cIt is our hope that these findings confirming the efficacy of apomorphine infusion will encourage doctors in the United States to offer this treatment to their patients and assess its efficacy in their own clinical practice,\u201d said Katzenschlager.

After a recovery period of approximately two months \u2014 during which the woman\u2019s chest skin heals, blood supply replenishes, and the expanders are gradually inflated to stretch the skin \u2014 the patient returns for an outpatient surgical procedure to replace the tissue expanders with permanent breast implants. In addition to exceptional cosmetic results, the technique is likely to improve clinical outcomes as evidenced by ongoing research that shows women who undergo this procedure experience less pain and a shorter recovery period.\n\n\u201cOver the past decade there have been dramatic improvements in breast reconstruction that utilize various types of surgical innovations, implants, and biologic tissue,\u201d notes Dr. Small. \u201cIt is very rewarding as a reconstructive surgeon to continuously refine these procedures for our patients.\u201d\n\nMs. Burt chose the Valley breast surgery team after carefully researching her treatment options for DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ), a diagnosis that is often debated among clinicians as to whether it should be classified as breast cancer at all. In DCIS, abnormal cells have not spread beyond the milk ducts into adjacent breast tissue or lymph nodes. After consulting with several breast surgeons and reconstructive surgeons, Ms. Burt opted for a nipple-sparing mastectomy performed by breast surgeon Tihesha Wilson, M.D., Assistant Medical Director of Valley\u2019s Breast Center. Immediately following in the operating room, Dr. Small performed the breast reconstruction. \u201cThis was a long journey,\u201d says Ms. Burt, a publicist for the San Francisco-based Fat Wreck Chords music company. \u201cDr. Wilson was more than patient with me as I first chose active surveillance for one year and then decided to undergo a double mastectomy when another area of DCIS was identified in November 2015. I am also grateful for Dr. Small\u2019s willingness to \u2018look outside the box\u2019 and for his determination to perform my reconstruction in a way that would give me the best results with the least amount of recovery time. I want to also commend the pathologists at Valley, who were exceptional in their diagnostic results.\u201d Dr. Wilson and Laura Klein, M.D., Medical Director of the Breast Center, have extensive experience in performing nipple-sparing mastectomy, a technically demanding surgery that is performed within aesthetically appealing minimally invasive incisions. With expertise in minimally invasive oncoplastic breast surgery, Dr. Wilson has also studied complementary medicine and provides her patients with a holistic, integrative approach to breast care. \u201cIt\u2019s important to listen to each woman\u2019s needs and then to decide together what is the best approach to treatment, so that in the end the cancer will be gone and the woman can move on with her life,\u201d says Dr. Wilson.\n\nThe Valley Breast Center provides comprehensive diagnostic, surgical, and support services using a multidisciplinary approach.

You could stockpile the vaccine and wouldn't have this wait to make a new pandemic-specific vaccine,\" she said.\n\nThe vaccine would be an important step in treating seasonal flu, not just pandemics.\n\n\"Flu kills every year. It's not just swine flu. Normally it's the very old or very young that die from flu, but every year there are deaths from influenza A,\" said Gilbert.\n\nIn the U.S alone it's believed about 36,000 people die from seasonal flu-related causes in an average year, according to the CDC.\n\nThe initial results are positive, says Peter Palese, professor and chair of microbiology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, but more research is needed before the new treatment is approved.\n\n\"I think it's a very interesting and very elegant approach and the data so far looks very, very good,\" he said.\n\n\"But although the vaccine has been give to humans, unfortunately there is no evidence presented to say if it really results in protection against infection.\"\n\nGilbert agrees more work is required before the vaccine becomes available, estimating a wait of at least five year, but says the results are a fundamental next step in the treatment of flu.\n\n\"It's fairly certain flu vaccines are going to change a lot in the next few years,\" she said.\n\n\"Whether it's this vaccine or another one someone else develops, I don't think we'll be continuing with the type of flu vaccines that we have at the moment.\"", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "", "answer": 1}, {"article": "We've long known that the Mediterranean diet is good for the heart.

But there are still questions about marijuana\u2019s long-term safety as a pain reliever, he said.\n\nWare and his colleagues recruited 21 adults who were suffering from chronic neuropathic pain after an injury or surgery. Three times a day, for five days, participants took a 25 milligram hit of one of four treatments: marijuana that was 2.5 percent, 6 percent, or 9.4 percent tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or a 0 percent placebo. All patients rotated in random order through the four different treatments, with a nine-day break between each one.\n\nDuring each treatment, participants were asked about their pain, sleep patterns, mood, and overall quality of life.\n\nPatients smoking 9.4 percent THC marijuana reported lower pain scores than when smoking the placebo - on average, 5.4 versus 6.1 on a scale from 0 (\u201cno pain\u201d) to 10 (\u201cworst possible pain\u201d). They also reported that they slept better, and were less anxious and depressed than when they were on the placebo.\n\nWhen smoking marijuana with moderate doses of THC, participants generally reported improved symptoms, but there was no significant difference in their relief from these doses compared to relief from the placebo treatment. There was also no difference in the quality of life or mood scores that participants reported when they were on any of the four treatments.\n\nThe highest dose of THC produced the most side effects, which included headaches, dry eyes, and a burning sensation in the regions where patients had pain.\n\nIn the second, third and fourth rounds of treatment, most - but not all - patients were able to tell when they had been on either the highest THC dose or the placebo. Most patients did not report feeling \u201chigh\u201d at any point during the study.\n\nAbout 1 to 2 percent of adults in the U.S. suffer from chronic neuropathic pain - pain that occurs when nerve fibers are damaged by injury or disease, and lingers even after the original wound has healed.

Each of the 25 patients enrolled in the study had two bad knees, but did not know which knee received the stem cells.\n\nGiven that the stem cell-treated knee was no better than the control-treated knee \u2014 both were significantly better than before the study began \u2014 the researchers say the stem cells\u2019 effectiveness remains somewhat uninterpretable. They are only able to conclude the procedure is safe to undergo as an option for knee pain, but they cannot yet recommend it for routine arthritis care.\n\n\u201cOur findings can be interpreted in ways that we now need to test \u2014 one of which is that bone marrow stem cell injection in one ailing knee can relieve pain in both affected knees in a systemic or whole-body fashion,\u201d says the study\u2019s lead author, Shane Shapiro, M.D., a Mayo Clinic orthopedic physician.\n\nJournalists, sound bites with Dr. Shane Shapiro are available in the downloads below.\n\n\u201cOne hypothesis is that the stem cells we tested can home to areas of injury where they are needed, which makes sense, given that stem cells injected intravenously in cancer treatments end up in the patients\u2019 bone marrow where they need to go,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is just a theory that can explain our results, so it needs further testing.\u201d\n\nAnother explanation is that merely injecting any substance into a knee offered relief from pain.\n\n\u201cThat could be, but both this idea and the notion that a placebo effect could be involved would be surprising, given that some patients are still doing very well years after their study treatment ended,\u201d says Dr. Shapiro.\n\nHe adds that these findings are important because while use of a patient\u2019s own stem cells for regenerative therapy is extraordinarily popular, the treatments may be untested and are often poorly regulated.\n\nStem cell clinics often offer expensive treatments for conditions that range from multiple sclerosis, lung and heart disease, to cosmetic treatments, such as facelifts. None of these techniques have been studied because clinics maintain that use of a patient\u2019s own cells is not a drug.\n\nBut, depending on how they are processed and used, stem cells can, in fact, be regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as biological products or drugs requiring rigorous safety and efficacy approval processes. In early September, the FDA held scientific meetings to clarify how to regulate such practices.\n\n\u201cWe feel that if we are going to offer any stem cell procedures to our patients, the science needs to be worked out,\u201d Dr. Shapiro says.\n\nThe study was conducted in Mayo\u2019s Human Cell Therapy Lab. Researchers extracted 60 to 90 milliliters of bone marrow from each patient, then filtered it, removed all blood cells, and concentrated it down to 4 to 5 milliliters. The solution, which contained tens of thousands of stem cells, was injected into a patient\u2019s knee using ultrasound-guided imagery.\n\n\u201cWe actually counted all of the stem cells with markers that are accepted by the FDA, and we made sure they would be able to survive inside the patient,\u201d Dr. Shapiro says. \u201cCounting is expensive. Most clinics just draw the cells from bone marrow or fat and inject them back into the patient without checking for stem cells, hoping that patients get better,\u201d he says.\n\nDr. Shapiro and his colleagues are currently designing new studies that will test whether the stem cells home to distant areas of injuries, as well as exploring other implications suggested in their findings.\n\nStudy investigators include Mayo Clinic in Florida senior author Mary L.

The authors presented their findings February 2 at the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) Forum 2018 in San Diego.\n\nThe findings could influence how neurologists prescribe the medication. \"Neurologists have been looking for safer ways to administer natalizumab infusions to their patients, but there hasn't been clear data on whether decreasing dosing frequency improves safety,\" says first study author Lana Zhovtis Ryerson, MD, assistant professor of neurology at NYU School of Medicine and an attending neurologist at NYU Langone's Multiple Sclerosis Comprehensive Care Center. \"Our safety findings are clinically and statistically significant, and we believe that extending the dosing schedule of natalizumab is practice changing and may save lives.\"\n\nNatalizumab, a monoclonal antibody, is used to prevent MS relapses, improve quality of life, and slow worsening disability. The medication is indicated to be prescribed in 300-milligram infusion doses every 4 weeks.\n\nTaking the medication longer than two years, however, may increase risk PML, which is caused by the John Cunningham virus (JCV). There have been 756 PML cases reported worldwide as of January 2018, with a global incidence rate of 4.19 per 1,000 PML cases in people treated with natalizumab. Patients who test JCV antibody-positive are typically either told to not to start natalizumab, or have had treatment stopped after two years, when risk was deemed to be too high.\n\nThe new study, however, reports safety data through up to 72 months, or 6 years, when the extended dosing regimens were applied, with risk reduction for PML as high as 94 percent.\n\nResearchers reviewed data on all patients who have been exposed to JCV who are enrolled in TOUCH, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-mandated Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program for natalizumab that requires manufacturers to document all uses of a medication to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. Since the optimal extended dose schedule is not known, researchers chose to look at the data in multiple ways, with the primary definition looking at extended dose history in the last 18 months, the secondary definition looking at extended dose occurring at any time in the dosing history, and for tertiary definition looking primarily at how extended dose history affects PML risk. The results showed clinically and statistically significant risk reductions with all definitions.\n\nThe new study did not look at drug efficacy comparing extended to standard doses. However, previous research led by Dr. Zhovtis-Ryerson's group found extending the dose up to 8 weeks did not negatively affect the medication's efficacy in a retrospective sample of 2,000 people. The authors are planning prospective efficacy studies of extended dose natalizumab.\n\nNatalizumab is manufactured by Biogen Idec and Elan, and sold under the name Tysabri\u00ae.

Chan School of Public Health, the U.S. National Cancer Institute, and more than 20 other medical centers and organizations finds that higher circulating vitamin D concentrations are significantly associated with lower colorectal cancer risk. This study strengthens the evidence, previously considered inconclusive, for a protective relationship. Optimal vitamin D concentrations for colorectal cancer prevention may be higher than the current National Academy of Medicine recommendations, which are based only on bone health. The study appears online in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nVitamin D, known for its role in maintaining bone health, is hypothesized to lower colorectal cancer risk via several pathways related to cell growth and regulation. Previous prospective studies have reported inconsistent results for whether higher concentrations of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the accepted measure of vitamin D status, are linked to lower risk of colorectal cancer. The few randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation and colorectal cancer completed thus far have not shown an effect; but study size, supplementation duration, and compliance may have contributed to their null findings.\n\n\"To address inconsistencies in prior studies on vitamin D and to investigate associations in population subgroups, we analyzed participant-level data, collected before colorectal cancer diagnosis, from 17 prospective cohorts and used standardized criteria across the studies,\" said Stephanie Smith-Warner, PhD, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and co-senior author on the article. The analysis included over 5,700 colorectal cancer cases and 7,100 controls from the United States, Europe, and Asia. A single, widely accepted assay and laboratory was used for new vitamin D measurements and calibration of existing vitamin D measurements. \"In the past, substantial differences between assays made it difficult to integrate vitamin D data from different studies,\" explained Regina G. Ziegler, PhD, a National Cancer Institute epidemiologist and co-senior author on the article. \"This calibration approach enabled us to systematically explore risk over the broad range of vitamin D levels seen internationally.\"\n\nCompared to participants with circulating vitamin D concentrations considered sufficient for bone health, those with deficient concentrations of vitamin D had a 31% higher risk of colorectal cancer during follow-up, which averaged 5.5 years (range: 1 - 25 years). Similarly, concentrations above bone health sufficiency were associated with a 22% lower risk. However, risk did not continue to decline at the highest concentrations. These associations persisted even after adjusting for known colorectal cancer risk factors. Protective associations were seen in all subgroups examined. However, the association was noticeably stronger in women than men at concentrations above bone health sufficiency. The lifetime risk of colorectal cancer is 4.2% (1 in 24) in women and 4.5% (1 in 22) in men. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women in the United States, with about 140,250 new cases and 50,630 deaths expected during 2018.\n\n\"Currently, health agencies do not recommend vitamin D for the prevention of colorectal cancer,\" said Marji L. McCullough, ScD, American Cancer Society epidemiologist and co-first author of the study. \"This study adds new information that agencies can use when reviewing evidence for vitamin D guidance and suggests that the concentrations recommended for bone health may be lower than would be optimal for colorectal cancer prevention.\"\n\nVitamin D can be obtained in the diet, particularly from fortified foods, from supplements, and from sun exposure. Experts recommend vitamin D be obtained through diet whenever possible because excessive ultraviolet radiation is a major risk factor for skin cancer.\n\nArticle: Circulating Vitamin D and Colorectal Cancer Risk: An International Pooling Project of 17 Cohorts.

A new study identifies patterns of communication that can help couples affected by Alzheimer\u2019s maintain a sense of connection, which could improve quality of life for both partners.\n\nPrevious research on communication in couples affected by Alzheimer\u2019s has tended to focus on deficits, said study author Christine Williams, professor and director of the PhD in Nursing program at Florida Atlantic University\u2019s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing. Identifying patterns that help couples maintain their bond could make it easier for caregiving spouses to find meaning and improve satisfaction with their marriage.\n\n\u201cNo one is looking at it from the perspective of what these couples are doing right, what is helping,\u201d said Williams, whose findings were published in the International Journal for Human Caring. \u201cSome past research has involved a caregiver giving directions and seeing if his or her spouse [with Alzheimer\u2019s] can follow. A relationship is obviously so much more than that.\u201d\n\nMembers of Williams\u2019s research team visited 15 couples in their home once a week for 10 weeks. The couples, who were recruited from a day program for people with memory disorders and their spouses, were receiving coaching in communication, with caregivers learning to listen, to avoid arguing, to not treat their spouse like a child. Twice during the 10 weeks, the couples were asked to discuss a topic of their choosing while the researcher left the room. A total of thirty 10-minute conversations were recorded.\n\nIn analyzing the recordings, Williams identified 10 communication patterns that caregiving spouses used to connect with their partners and show affection. These patterns showed the caregivers applying what they\u2019d learned through coaching in creative ways, she said. They included sharing news about friends or relatives or plans for the day as a way to involve their spouse in day-to-day events; waiting patiently and keeping eye contact while spouses searched for words; and finding alternate ways to communicate \u2014 for example, singing songs together when attempts to engage the spouse in certain topics failed.\n\nThe caregiving spouses seemed to value their partners\u2019 efforts to communicate as much as or more than the actual content of their conversations. They were willing to listen to stories they had heard before, and resisted correcting their partners\u2019 versions of past events. This showed that they \u201cvalue the relationship more than being right,\u201d Williams said.\n\nSome of the caregivers did voice frustration or tried to teach their partners information they had forgotten. Future research might focus on interventions that could help diffuse these frustrations, the paper noted. Yet Williams hopes that the more supportive and positive communication patterns that many of the caregivers showed will help nurses coach spouses and family members affected by Alzheimer\u2019s. Previous research has found that communication decline among people with dementia is a significant source of stress to caregivers, and most say they need education about communication.\n\n\u201cThe reality is, a person with dementia isn\u2019t going to have a dramatic breakthrough and remember things forgotten,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAt the same time, people with Alzheimer\u2019s do have moments of clarity or show affection when it\u2019s unexpected.

Besides colonoscopy, these included flexible sigmoidoscopy (an invasive procedure that penetrates less far than colonoscopy); CT colonography (a scan of the colon); traditional fecal occult blood tests (looking for blood in stool); and the recently approved Cologuard DNA-based stool test.\n\nThe panel said there were no comparison studies that suggested that any of the screening methods were any more effective than others. There are varying amounts of proof supporting the effectiveness of each, and each method has its advantages and limitations, the panelists said.\n\nAnd what about colon cancer screening for the elderly?\n\nIn its statement, the panel said that \"for some adults ages 76 to 85, the benefits of screening are smaller, and the potential for harm greater. However, some people in this age group may benefit, especially if they have never been screened before and are healthy enough to undergo treatment if cancer is found.\"\n\nFor this older group, the USPSTF recommends that decisions on screening be made during consultations between the patient and his or her doctor.\n\nAll of the recommendations are specific to symptom-free people 50 years of age or older with an average risk colorectal cancer, the panel stressed.

Many of the electrodes sit in or near memory areas, and the wait can take weeks in the hospital. Cognitive scientists use this opportunity, with patients\u2019 consent, to present memory tests and take recordings.\n\nThis approach \u2014 called direct neural recording, and piggybacking entirely on the clinical placement of the electrodes \u2014 has become the leading edge of research into the biology of human memory. This study used data from 150 patients, and had 20 collaborators from institutions around the country, including Emory University, the University of Washington, the Mayo Clinic and the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nIn a series of experiments, the researchers had patients memorize lists of words and later, after a distraction, asked them to freely recall as many of the words as they could.

The average age of the study participants was 52 and the average body-mass index was 39 (30 and over is considered obese). Orlistat is marketed as Xenical, a prescription medication, and Alli, available over the counter.\n\nThe low-carb diet began with a carbohydrate intake of less than 20 grams of carbohydrates a day. The group taking orlistat received a 120-milligram dose of the drug three times daily and got less than 30 percent of their calories from fat.\n\nOver 48 weeks, the low-carbohydrate group lost 9.5 percent of their body weight, while the orlistat group lost 8.5 percent. \"Good\" cholesterol (HDL) and triglyceride levels improved in both groups.

Even low levels of dehydration can seriously compromise normal physiological function, yet recent studies looking at hydration in laboring women via the rates of intravenous (IV) fluid showed conflicting results. By pooling the data of several studies, Thomas Jefferson University researchers showed that a higher rate of IV fluids not only decreased c-section rates, but also shortened the overall length of labor by one hour, as well as shortened the pushing phase. The results were published online as an accepted article in Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica.\n\n\"The results are compelling and strongly argue for a change in practice,\" says Vincenzo Berghella, M.D., the Director of Maternal Fetal Medicine and Professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University. \"We have already begun changing practice at Jefferson to give women more fluids in labor, to allow them to have the best chance of delivering vaginally.\"\n\nDr. Berghella and colleagues compiled data from seven small clinical trials that collectively included a total of 1,215 women. Of those, about half (or 593 women) received IV fluids at a rate of 250 milliliters per hour, and the other half (622 women) received fluids at the lower rate of 125 milliliters per hour. General practice in the United States is to administer IV fluids at 125 milliliters per hour during labor.\n\nWith the data pooled, the researchers could see a clear difference in outcomes for women in the two groups. Women getting the faster fluid rate (250 milliliters per hour) were less likely to get a cesarean section. The higher fluid rate also reduced the overall time of labor by an average of 64 minutes, and shortened the pushing phase by nearly 3 minutes, on average.\n\n\"We've known that it's important for women to stay well hydrated during pregnancy and labor. This study suggests that IV fluids could help women maintain hydration at appropriate levels, reduce the likelihood of c-section, and decrease length of labor,\" says Dr. Berghella. \"Recently, we also showed that letting women eat more liberally in labor, especially in early labor, has benefits including shorter labor, and no identifiable risks.\"\n\nToday, approximately one in three births in the United States occurs via c-section, despite an increased attention by national and international obstetric societies on safely reducing the practice.

Now a dangerous stare-down as Iran dares world powers to do something about it.\n\n \n\n Who will blink first? \n\n \n\n After limping out of Florida and into the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Ernesto is roaring back. Is it about to slam into the Carolina coast as a hurricane? I'll speak with Max Mayfield, the director of the National Hurricane Center. \n\n \n\n And it's 5:00 p.m. here in Washington. A possible cancer breakthrough helps a father fight off a deadly disease and realize his dream. I'll ask a pioneering researcher what it could mean for your family. \n\n \n\n Wolf Blitzer is off today.\n\n \n\n I'm John King. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.\n\n \n\n A momentous day. The deadline for Iran to halt its nuclear program has come and gone. The U.N. watchdog agency reports Iran continues its uranium enrichment activities. President Bush is warning there must be consequences for Iran's defiance, but Iran's president warns his nation will not yield to pressure. \n\n \n\n Trying to rally support for the war in Iraq and his anti-terror policies, President Bush says America is now battling the successors to fascists and communists. Conjuring up images of older wars, he made a new vow to press on until victory. But even as he spoke, a wave of new bomb and martyr attacks rocked Baghdad, leaving dozens dead and hundreds hurt.\n\n \n\n Standing by, CNN's Brian Todd and our White House corespondent, Suzanne Malveaux. \n\n \n\n But we turn first to Aneesh Raman, live in Tehran -- Aneesh. ANEESH RAMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: John, Iranian officials have tonight dismissed this IAEA report as baseless, as illegal. This, as it is now official Iran has not met the U.N. deadline. \n\n \n\n (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n \n\n RAMAN (voice-over): Defiant to the end, Iran's president, speaking this morning to huge crowds in northwest Iran, left no doubt his country will not suspend its nuclear program. \n\n \n\n \"This nation,\" he said, \"will not tolerate tyranny and will not give in to a cruel pressure and violation of its rights, even a bit.\"\n\n \n\n People in this agriculture region are some of Ahmadinejad's strongest supporters, cheering every phrase. Here, for some, he is a hero. And they reveled in their president's continued challenge to debate U.S. President Bush. \n\n \n\n \"They say they want the public to know all of the news and facts,\" he says, \"and decide for themselves. But when we offered to debate the world's problems and corruption and let the world judge for themselves, they rejected.\"\n\n \n\n But it is Iran's rejection of the U.N. deadline to stop its nuclear program that matters today. And in Tehran, as shops open for business despite fears of businesses go down of sanctions, here as well there was defiance. \n\n \n\n \"We have undergone sanctions for 27 years,\" says Hussein. \"We are not afraid of sanctions. Iranians can live off of bite of bread and live in cramped dwellings.\"\n\n \n\n There are many here who do fear sanctions outright. And while today's deadline was big news in Iran, Iranians have known this day was coming, have known they can do little to affect their government's choices. They can only now hope against the worst.\n\n \n\n \"If a military invasion against Iran is a possibility,\" says Barham (ph), \"it's to the Iranians' benefit to resolve the problem peacefully.\"\n\n \n\n A military invasion is not seen as something that will come any time soon. But Iran's government has made it clear through war games that have been ongoing for weeks now that it will defend against any attack. \n\n \n\n (END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n \n\n RAMAN: Iranian officials do not think sanctions are inevitable. They are heading to Europe next week to call for new talks. So tonight, in Iran, they do not seem to think that time has run out -- John. \n\n \n\n KING: Aneesh Raman for us in Tehran.\n\n \n\n Aneesh, thank you very much. Now, there's no telling where this crisis may turn. But for now, Iran has made itself a major player on the world stage. \n\n \n\n Here's CNN's Brian Todd to explain -- Brian. \n\n \n\n BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: A major player, John, without actually having a nuclear weapon yet and without membership in any security alliance like NATO. That, analysts say, speaks to the intelligence and resilience of Iran's leadership. \n\n \n\n (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n \n\n TODD (voice-over): Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's position against the West may never have been stronger. Start with the nuclear issue. If Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapon, experts say, the implications are enormous. \n\n \n\n DAVID ALBRIGHT, FMR. U.N. WEAPONS INSPECTOR: What is Egypt going to do? What is Saudi Arabia going to do? I mean, will Saudi Arabia, you know, appeal to Pakistan for some kind of nuclear assistance? \n\n \n\n TODD: But Iran is already a military threat on the ground, with one of the largest troop forces and ballistic missile stocks in the Middle East. And by supporting Hezbollah in its fight against Israel, analysts say, Iran has become hugely popular on the so-called Arab street, where to many it has punctured a hole in the belief that Israel's military is unbeatable. \n\n \n\n From Lebanon, turn east, toward two countries bordering Iran where U.S. boots are on the ground. \n\n \n\n AFSHIN MOLAVI, NEW AMERICA FOUNDATION: In many ways, we in the United States have become Iran's neighbors because we have troops in Iraq and troops in Afghanistan. And Iran has significant influence over these two countries that we view as important fronts in the war on terror. \n\n \n\n TODD: In southern Iraq, analysts say, Iran has adopted its so- called Hezbollah model, providing Shia groups with money and social services to essentially compete with U.S. influence the way Hezbollah did after Israel invaded Lebanon in the early '80s. And with the world's third largest oil reserves serving two of the world's largest oil consumers, India and China, Iran's got undeniable leverage to drive prices. \n\n \n\n So what does Tehran want? \n\n \n\n VALI NASR, AUTHOR, \"THE SHIA REVIVAL\": Ultimately, they want to drive the point home to the U.S. that, you know, they matter, you cannot just isolate them, you cannot change their regime. You have to deal with them. \n\n \n\n (END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n \n\n TODD: And now many analysts say Iran's leaders are in a unique position to force the West to deal with them. They've emerged with a stronger hand after the Israel-Hezbollah conflict and are operating with the belief that few nations want to really punish them over the nuclear issue -- John. \n\n \n\n KING: A great look into a high-stakes showdown. Brian Todd, thank you very much. \n\n \n\n Now, the United States has made it clear it will seek sanctions against Iran, but as the Bush administration ways its next move, the president is also dealing with another major international challenge in moving ahead with a new campaign to rally support for the war in Iraq. \n\n \n\n Let's turn now to our White House correspondent, Suzanne Malveaux -- Suzanne.\n\n \n\n SUZANNE MALVEAUX, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, John, when it comes to Iran, of course, there are some administration officials who are quietly saying, look, you know, the deadline has come and gone. And they believe that it was a waste of time to begin with, these negotiations with Iran. Kind of an \"I told you so\" attitude about this whole thing. Some believing it wasn't even important to talk to Iran and try to go through this process. \n\n \n\n But having said that, they have gone through the process. Iran now on the record that it remains defiant. \n\n \n\n There are others in the administration who are thinking, look, having said that, we need to buy some time here, we need to make sure that the rest of the U.N. Security Council members, the P5, plus Germany, are on board here with tough economic sanctions. It is really the only thing this administration can do, is to try to convince the rest of the world that Iran is a dangerous regime and that they have to have the kind of sanctions that have teeth. \n\n \n\n President Bush today addressing that very issue. But it is far from certain whether or not that's going to happen. \n\n \n\n (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n \n\n GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It is time for Iran to make a choice. We've made our choice. We will continue to work closely with our allies to find a diplomatic solution. But there must be consequences for Iran's defiance and we must not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. \n\n \n\n (END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n \n\n MALVEAUX: So, certainly, John, what you're going to see in the next couple of weeks, high-stakes diplomacy in front of the cameras, behind the cameras, of course, to try to convince Russia and China to move forward with the kind of tough sanctions they believe will change Iran's behavior. But a lot of the feeling here is that this is an exercise that's gone on for years. And essentially, they knew that it would come to this, that Iran would remain defiant, and so they want to push forward those sanctions. On the other front, of course, Iraq, President Bush kicking off, launching this new -- his third public relations strategy, or campaign, if you will, to try to convince the American people that this war on terror is worth it. It comes at a time, of course, November midterm elections right around the corner, the anniversary of September 11th. And lots of criticism -- lots of criticism from Democrats, even some Republicans, to pull out those troops sooner, as opposed to later.\n\n \n\n President Bush today really framing this argument in the larger, broader context, the war on terror, as one that is an ideological struggle, one that he compared to past struggles against communism and fascism. \n\n \n\n (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n \n\n BUSH: The security of the civilized world depends on victory in the war on terror, and that depends on victory in Iraq. So the United States of America will not leave until victory is achieved. \n\n \n\n (END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n \n\n MALVEAUX: And, of course, John, we have heard that before from the president, making the case that Iraq is the central front in this war on terror. Many historians, however, debate that, saying they don't believe that's a credible argument. They believe that that is somewhat of an exaggeration -- John.\n\n \n\n KING: Two major challenging facing the president. At least two at the moment. \n\n \n\n Suzanne Malveaux for us at the White House.\n\n \n\n Suzanne, thank you very much.\n\n \n\n And from political storms to those of nature, right now Tropical Storm Ernesto is flirting with hurricane strength, causing many to worry it also could be flirting with disaster. \n\n \n\n Let's get the latest on where this storm and where it could soon be. CNN meteorologist Reynolds Wolf is at the CNN hurricane center in Atlanta. \n\n \n\n Hey, Reynolds.\n\n \n\n REYNOLDS WOLF, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Hey, John.\n\n \n\n (WEATHER REPORT)\n\n \n\n KING: And time now for \"The Cafferty File.\"\n\n \n\n Jack's of course in New York.\n\n \n\n Hi, Jack.\n\n \n\n JACK CAFFERTY, CNN ANCHOR: John, things to add to the list of stuff that doesn't shock me. \n\n \n\n Iran, of course, ignoring that U.N. deadline to stop enriching uranium. The president there, Ahmadinejad, hasn't been keeping his feelings on that issue a secret. The IAEA confirmed today that Iran is continuing its nuclear activities. \n\n \n\n President Bush this morning said there must be consequences for Iran's failure to comply with the U.N. deadline. Consequences, of course, can take different forms. \n\n \n\n Presumably, the next step will involve going to the U.N. to get sanctions imposed on Iran. The problem with that is that China and/or Russia probably won't go along. And without both of their support it won't -- it won't happen. \n\n \n\n Of course military action is another possibility.\n\n \n\n Why do I think the U.S. won't have any better success putting together a coalition of the willing to fight Iran than it did for Iraq? And, of course, that sure has turned out well, hasn't it?\n\n \n\n So here's the question: Do you think the Bush administration plans at some point to attack Iran?\n\n \n\n E-mail your thoughts to CaffertyFile@CNN.com or go to CNN.com/CaffertyFile -- John. \n\n \n\n KING: We'll have a hearty political debate about that one. \n\n \n\n Thank you, Jack.\n\n \n\n And up ahead, he's a key Republican breaking ranks with the president over the war in Iraq. Congressman Chris Shays now wants a timetable for bringing U.S. troops home. He's standing by to join us live.\n\n \n\n Also, promising results from a clinical trial that left some patients cancer-free. We'll talk about it with CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta.\n\n \n\n Plus, details of the find that has art lovers screaming with joy. \n\n \n\n Stay with us. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.\n\n \n\n (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n \n\n (JOINED IN PROGRESS) \n\n \n\n REP. CHRISTOPHER SHAYS (R), CONNECTICUT: Let me just be very clear. \n\n \n\n First, I totally support the war in Iraq. I believe we have to be engaged militarily, economically, politically 100 percent. I believe it would be an absolutely outrage if we left Iraq right now or prematurely. We would simply -- I'm getting talk -- people are talking in the background, guys. KING: Let's try again, sir, and see if you can figure that out. \n\n \n\n SHAYS: I'm hearing talk in the background. \n\n \n\n KING: Congressman Shays, we're going to take a quick break. We'll come right back to you. We'll try to work out our technical gremlins.\n\n \n\n We'll take a quick break here in THE SITUATION ROOM. We'll be right back.\n\n \n\n (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \n\n \n\nKING: We're having some technical issues. We are trying to reestablish our interview with Republican congressman Chris Shays of Connecticut. We hope to get back to that momentarily.\n\n \n\n In the meantime, though, our Zain Verjee joins us to look at other stories making news right now.\n\n \n\n Hi, Zain.\n\n \n\n ZAIN VERJEE, CNN ANCHOR: Hi, John.\n\n \n\n He says he's a man of god, but he'll soon spend time in purgatory. Warren Jeffs will soon be leaving Las Vegas. \n\n \n\n The wanted man with many wives who was nabbed on Monday has waived his right to extradition. He's expected to be transferred to a Utah jail named Purgatory. There he's going to face charges of rape as an accomplice for allegedly arranging a marriage between an underage girl and an older man. \n\n \n\n It's supposed to test the strength of the nation's defenses, but today it was too sensitive to stand up to bad weather. Fog foiled a test of the nation's missile defense system today.\n\n \n\n The fog was in Alaska, where a missile was to launch. That missile was to be intercepted by a missile launched from a military base in California. The test is now planned for tomorrow. \n\n \n\n And from one postponed launch to another. Today NASA announced that it's going to try and launch the space shuttle Atlantis on Wednesday. This, after a planned launch was delayed by a lighting strike and bad weather this week.\n\n \n\n Atlantis would resume construction of the International Space Station. The first time NASA would do so since the 2003 Columbia disaster -- John.\n\n \n\n Zain Verjee, thank you very much.\n\n \n\n And we think we've resolved our technical issues. We're going to try to go back now to Congressman Christopher Shays, Republican of Connecticut, a congressman who has been to Iraq 14 times, a strong supporter of the war, now someone who says the administration's policies must change, there should be a timetable to bring U.S. troops home.\n\n \n\n Congressman Shays, I hope you can hear me without the interference at the moment.\n\n \n\n SHAYS: I hear you fine.\n\n \n\n KING: My apologies for that.\n\n \n\n SHAYS: Thank you.\n\n \n\n KING: My apologies for that. Let us try again. \n\n \n\n Let me go back to where I began.\n\n \n\n SHAYS: Sure.\n\n \n\n KING: You were, as you note, a strong supporter of the war at the beginning. You now say there should be a timetable. \n\n \n\n Just a few weeks ago you said this: \"Only about 40 percent of Iraq is under the military's control. You have 60 percent still not under control. To have a timetable is absolutely foolish.\"\n\n \n\n As you know, your opponent and other critics would say, \"What in Iraq has changed in three weeks?\" The only thing that has changed is Christopher Shays political position running for reelection in Connecticut. \n\n \n\n SHAYS: Yes. Thanks for the question. You left out an important part. \n\n \n\n The people who were talking about a time period were saying leave immediately, or leave in six months, or leave in a year, with nothing to do with the capability of the Iraqis to defend themselves. We attack them, we abolish their army, their police and their border patrol, and it would be an outrage to leave before they have their army, their police and their border control. But the key point is, we know how long it will take to train their army, their police and their border control. \n\n \n\n And when they have their army, their police and their border patrol, then we can leave. But to leave when we only have 40 percent would be an absolute outrage. \n\n \n\n My point to you is, we need to drive this issue. We need to get the Iraqis to do their job. We need to get them to take action. \n\n \n\n And since January, they have done nothing other than create a government, and the government has done nothing. The political leaders are now, as we speak, on vacation, not doing the heavy lifting. \n\n \n\n KING: Well, then let me -- I understand the distinction you're making, not immediately, but let's set a timetable. The president says anyone who talks like that is irresponsible. \n\n \n\n What do you say to the president of the United States? \n\n \n\n SHAYS: Well, I think the president has an opinion, but I think he's dead wrong. It's a timeline not about when a war ends, because who knows when the war ends. The fighting will still continue. It's a timeline to transfer the power to the Iraqis. \n\n \n\n KING: Now, the president obviously is making this argument now in an election year context in which you know full well Iraq has soured the mood of much of the electorate. And many say the Republican hold in Congress is in jeopardy because of that. \n\n \n\n I want you to listen to something the president said today in his speech to the American Legion in Salt Lake City. \n\n \n\n (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n \n\n GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: As veterans, you have seen this kind of enemy before. They are successors to fascists, to Nazis, to communists, and other totalitarians of the 20th century. And history shows what the outcome will be.\n\n \n\n (END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n \n\n KING: Now, I know you thought some of the remarks of Secretary Rumsfeld to the same audience earlier in the week were \"over the top,\" in your words. What about what the president said there? And what's the distinction? \n\n \n\n SHAYS: Well, I'm not sure exactly the difference of what the president is saying to Rumsfeld. What I did not like about Rumsfeld was his talk about the Nazi party. \n\n \n\n I actually believe with all my heart and soul that this is a war we can win provided the Iraqis have the same kind of timelines that they had in '05. They made tremendous success when we transferred power in '04. They had election in January. They created a group to write the constitution. \n\n \n\n They had a deadline for the constitution. They had a deadline for ratifying the constitution. They had a deadline for electing the government under the new constitution.\n\n \n\n They have had no deadlines since January and they have done nothing. And it is important that we motivate them, because the bottom line is, if they're not motivated, we can do anything we want and we won't succeed. \n\n \n\n KING: So the president, in your view, needs to set some firm deadlines for the Iraqi government and a deadline for starting to bring U.S. troops home. \n\n \n\n What do you make of the context of this in this political campaign? We're two months from the election. I know it's a major policy debate, but it is the defining political challenge in this country right now. \n\n \n\n Should the president -- he's out there giving a series of three speeches. He's out there talking about Iraq.\n\n \n\n They think at the White House it is important to talk to the American people about Iraq. Some Republican campaign strategists would prefer they just quiet down and let you run on local issues in Connecticut.\n\n \n\n What do you think? \n\n \n\n SHAYS: Well, I think Iraq is the primary issue. I think that we're fighting Islamist terrorists. I think it's connected to the war on terror. And I think we need a dialogue. \n\n \n\n If we have a disagreement about that as Americans, we need to sort it out. That's what you need in debates. \n\n \n\n We had a debate on the presidency last time on whether someone earned three Purple Hearts or whether, in fact, the president has fulfilled his National Guard service requirements. We need debates that are far more meaningful than whether someone is motivated to take a position for politics. \n\n \n\n Why not look what that person is saying? What do we do to get the Iraqis to start to do some heavy lifting? \n\n \n\n This president should be reaching out to Democrats to say, we need to find common ground as Americans. We need to speak with one voice. \n\n \n\n You want a timeline? I think your timeline is too quick. I don't want a timeline, where can we find common ground? \n\n \n\n I think the common ground is with what I'm suggesting. A timeline based on what Iraqis can logically take our place. \n\n \n\n They know then they have to do the heavy lifting. Americans know that there is some limit to what we're going to do. The Iraqis need to have a timeline on reconciliation, a timeline on the constitution, a timeline on getting the provincial elections to happen. \n\n \n\n KING: You're in a tough race, Congressman Chris Shays. This is a White House that is known for playing hardball politics from time to time, and they don't like it that you have drawn a distinction with this president when it comes to Iraq policy because they think it could cause some other Republicans to break when they see a guy who's been there 14 times, a senior Republican in Congress taking issue with the White House. \n\n \n\n Has there been any talk of retaliation? Any talk of cutting off money? What has the White House said to you? \n\n \n\n SHAYS: Well, let me just say this: they understand my position. But the bottom line is, if we want to win the war in Iraq, we need to motivate the Iraqis to do some heavy lifting. \n\n \n\n We need to get them back from vacation, we need to have them make tough decisions. And that, to me, is the bottom line. I go where the truth takes me. Whether or not I win an election or lose an election is irrelevant to me. This war is far too important to lose. \n\n \n\n KING: Congressman Chris Shays of Connecticut, thank you for joining us today, sir. And again, my apologies for the technical issues. I could see you had a little bit more as we continued the conversation, but you did a better job than I do when I deal with them. \n\n \n\n So, Congressman, thank you very much.\n\n \n\n SHAYS: Thank you.\n\n \n\n KING: Thank you, sir. Take care.\n\n \n\n And coming up, now a tropical storm, but it seemingly wants to be a hurricane. Ernesto is lashing the Carolinas and Virginia. We'll have the latest on where it is and where it's likely going. \n\n \n\n And it's not a cure, but it's said to be a step toward a solution. A new treatment for cancer. So exciting to experts, they're calling it the first major success in battling cancer with gene therapy. \n\n \n\n (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \n\n \n\n KING: Wolf Blitzer is off today. I'm John King. You're in the SITUATION ROOM. \n\n \n\n For more on Tropical Storm Ernesto now, let's go to Reynolds Wolf. He's in the CNN hurricane headquarters in Atlanta as the storm moves north -- Reynolds.\n\n \n\n REYNOLDS WOLF, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Absolutely. Here's the latest we have for you. \n\n \n\n The storm is slowing lifting its way to the north. Already, it's brought heavy rainfall to parts of Charleston, South Carolina, as well as the North Carolina coast. The storm expected to make its way right to the South Carolina/North Carolina border just south of Wilmington as we make our way to -- I'd say about 8:30, 9 p.m. or so Eastern Time. That's when the storm is expected to make its way on shore.\n\n \n\n Now, there has been quite an increase in power over the last 24 hours. In fact, the storm was coming off the coast of Florida as a very weak depression but since then, it has strengthened to a powerful tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 70 miles per hour. \n\n \n\n And there is the chance the storm could become a hurricane, Category 1 hurricane, as it makes its way on shore around 9 p.m., 8 p.m. this evening. \n\n \n\n Now as you take a look at the path we have from the National Hurricane Center, he storm is expected to weaken once it comes on land. And it should weaken from, say, a tropical storm to a depression as we get to Friday afternoon.\n\n \n\n And then as it surges its way north and then veers off towards the Great Lakes, the northwest, it is expected to be a depression. Although it will be weak, although winds will not be that strong and that much of an issue, the heavy rain could be catastrophic in many places. \n\n \n\n Keep in mind, the ground in many places is saturated through Virginia, up into West Virginia, into portions of Pennsylvania. But not only that, the ground's is very rocky, which doesn't absorb that moisture really well. With rainfall totals which could exceed eight inches, perhaps as much as a foot of rainfall in some places, flooding is not going to be a possibility. It is going to happen. And that's one thing we really want you to be aware of. \n\n \n\n But this is not the only storm we're dealing with in the tropics. In fact John, we have Hurricane John. This is out in the Pacific. This storm continues to spin. It is not a tropical storm. This is a hurricane, a Category 2 storm. It has weakened since its last update and is expected to be staying at that Category 2 storm level as it makes its way through Cabo San Lucas, bringing heavy surf, heavy rainfall and with that, again, just the possibility of a big storm surge. \n\n \n\n We're talking about six to eight feet, perhaps higher in some places. Then the storm will veer off to the west by 2 p.m. Saturday. So, if you have any travel plans to Cabo San Lucas over the next 12 to 24 hours, this is time to call your travel agent and certainly make some different plans. No question about it. \n\n \n\n But we're going to keep an eye on both coasts for you. That's what we do here at the hurricane center at CNN. We're going to be keeping an eye on, of course, the east as well as the West Coast. \n\n \n\n That's the latest we have for you. Let's send it back to you in Washington. \n\n \n\n KING: All right, Reynolds. We'll check back with you in a little bit.\n\n \n\n But now we're going to get a little bit more on Tropical Storm Ernesto. Let's go to Pawley Zion, South Carolina. Anderson Burns from our affiliate, WCIV, is live for us on the coast -- Anderson. \n\n \n\n ANDERSON BURNS, WCIV CORRESPONDENT: Yes, this has been one of those things where I've been watching the weather forecasters sort of try and guess which way this thing is going. Very unpredictable.\n\n \n\n Well, I can tell you, having been out here since the thing started early this morning, it's the same thing when you're on the beach watching it. This thing is literally changing by the second. Every 30 seconds, the surf changes, the height of the waves. \n\n \n\n Right now we're looking at very rough surf. Six, seven feet off -- surf is coming in. Crashing waves, very violent also very beautiful. \n\n \n\n But just three minutes ago it almost looked as if the sun was coming out. And that, I guess, seems to be the pattern going on here. The storm right now is 75 miles due east of Charleston and it's heading northeast. So we should pass by Pawleys Island, around 9, 10 p.m.\n\n \n\n And after that things should obviously lighten up a bit. But let's be honest: These folks who live along South Carolina went through Hugo. Folks here are basically having parties. We've been getting a lot of food, a lot of drinks. It's been a lot of fun out here. So I think the theme for folks here, it's been more fun than fear. But we'll have to see what happens in the next few hours. \n\n \n\n Back to you.\n\n \n\n KING: Anderson, thank you very much. Let's hope the path of that storm makes that the right choice. Anderson Burns for us from Pawleys Island, thank you very much.\n\n \n\n And still to come here, it's in no way a cure, but doctors are calling it a success in the battles against cancer. A new therapy that saved the lives of two men with an aggressive forms of the disease. Our doctor, \n\n \n\n And Jack Cafferty is wondering, is Iran thumbing its nose at the world? Could the United States be planning to respond with an attack? Jack has your e-mails.\n\n \n\n Stay right here. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.\n\n \n\n (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n \n\n KING: Results from a clinical trial should give hope to the 60,000 Americans diagnosed with the skin cancer, melanoma each year. \n\n \n\n CNN senior medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta joins us with the fascinating details -- Sanjay.\n\n \n\n DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, John.\n\n \n\n I love these stories, because this is a good story. Today we get a chance to talk about a new form, potentially, of cancer therapy. It is early. It is in its infancy, as you will hear. But you almost get the sense that a page has turned in the world of cancer therapy. \n\n \n\n (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n \n\n GUPTA (voice-over): Mark Origer shared the dreams of many fathers I've met: to walk his daughter down the aisle on her wedding day. But melanoma almost took that away from him. \n\n \n\n He was diagnosed with the deadly skin cancer in 1999. After an operation it went away, but it came back three years later. And by 2004, his doctors in Wisconsin could find nothing that would slow its spread. It moved into its liver. \n\n \n\n MARK ORIGER, CANCER PATIENT: I was just pretty much devastated when I found out that I did not respond. Right around that time my daughter got engaged. And I knew there was going to be a wedding coming up, and there was a concern. I wanted to be there. \n\n \n\n GUPTA: The chance of that happening wasn't very good. But then, Mark's dreams intersected with the dreams of a doctor halfway across the country. Doctor Steven Rosenberg is a cancer fighting pioneer at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. \n\n \n\n When he was a young doctor in Boston, he saw a patient fight off cancer without any treatment. \n\n \n\n DR. STEVEN ROSENBERG, NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE: And it got me to thinking about the fact that here this patient's body had learned how to destroy its own cancer. And I've spent the last 25 years trying to figure out how to make that happen again.\n\n \n\n GUPTA: Not with a knife or chemotherapy or even radiation, but by teaching deep inside the body and teaching the human immune system to kill cancer all on its own. A remarkable idea. And one that doctors put to the test in clinical trials with mark and 16 other patients diagnosed with melanoma. \n\n \n\n Doctors took some of their immune cells, called lymphocytes, the warriors of the immune system, and added the genes of a virus that would seek out tumors, attach to them and destroy them. \n\n \n\n In 15 patients the treatment didn't work. But in two so far, the cancer seems to have completely disappeared. Mark was the first. And this week when we meet him more than a year and a half after the treatment, he found out he's still cancer-free. \n\n \n\n ROSENBERG: Mark, as you know, is one of the first patients to respond to this new treatment. So we're thrilled, as I know he is. \n\n \n\n ORIGER: Yes. Absolutely. \n\n \n\n GUPTA (on camera): How does it feel to be the first? \n\n \n\n ORIGER: It feels unique; it does. It feels like quite an honor. \n\n \n\n GUPTA (voice-over): Although the approach is still in clinical trials, the results are published in the journal \"Science\". \n\n \n\n ROSENBERG: This is a highly experimental treatment that we've used in only a few patients. But it represents a proof of the principle for the first time, to my knowledge, that you can actually genetically manipulate the human body and cause disease regression. \n\n \n\n GUPTA: And yes, Mark's other dream also came true, as well. On September 17, 2005, he walked his daughter Katie down the aisle, virtually cancer-free. \n\n \n\n ORIGER: It's a celebration, a celebration of life. It's the beginning of my daughter's life, new life, beginning of my new life. I think I shed more tears than anybody. \n\n \n\n (END VIDEOTAPE) GUPTA: We've been talking about gene therapy for so long and the potential promise of gene therapy. This is an amazing story, you know. Again, it almost feels like a page has turned, John, in the world of cancer therapy. \n\n \n\n KING: Quite uplifting. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, you stay right there, because I want your help as we bring in the man behind this promising new treatment. Dr. Steven Rosenberg joins us from the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. \n\n \n\n Doctor, thank you for joining us, No. 2. No. 2, congratulations on what at least is the beginning of what could quite be something. \n\n \n\n I want to ask you a question. And then bring Dr. Gupta back into this and get the layman out of the way so he can ask some smart questions. According to the report, it worked on two patients, didn't work on 15 others. Is there something different about the 15 that didn't work on? Or maybe better put, is there something in the two it did work on that leads you to the next development? \n\n \n\n ROSENBERG: It's important to emphasize this is a highly experimental treatment that's still in the course of development. Of course, all of the patients that we treated in this report in \"Science\" were treated two years ago. We waited to publish it to see if, in fact, the tumors that disappeared would stay away, and they have. \n\n \n\n We've used viruses to introduce new genes into cells to make them into cancer fighting cells, and we can do it much better two years later. So, my hope is, as we continue to improve this technology, the response rates are going to go up. \n\n \n\n KING: Jump on in, Sanjay.\n\n \n\n GUPTA: Dr. Rosenberg, what is the sort of next step here? We talk about melanoma, obviously, specifically. What is your vision? Do you think this is something that can be used for other cancers ultimately, as well? \n\n \n\n ROSENBERG: The critical finding here was the ability to take a normal lymphocyte out of the blood of a patient. These are the immune fighting cells. They're white blood cells. And convert a normal cell that could not recognize the cancer, and by genetic engineering techniques convert it into a cell that could recognize the cancer. \n\n \n\n Now in this paper we published in \"Science\", we show that we could insert genes that could make these normal lymphocytes recognize melanoma, and when we gave them to patients, they could in some patients cause those tumors to regress. \n\n \n\n We have now found viruses that can introduce molecules into normal lymphocytes that can convert those cells into cells that can recognize breast cancer, colon cancer, other kinds of common cancers. But we haven't yet begun to treat those patients. Those are clinical trials that we hope to start in the next several months. KING: Dr. Rosenberg, John King again. I want to jump in. You say clinical trials you hope to start in the next several months. If there's somebody watching right now who has cancer, or a family member who has cancer and they want to take part in those trials or they want to see if there's any experimental treatment available for them, what's the answer?\n\n \n\n ROSENBERG: I would emphasize that these are very early studies. This is a highly experimental treatment only available here at the clinical center for the National Cancer Institute. \n\n \n\n When we do begin treating patients with other kinds of cancers it will be in small numbers of patients that will be studied very intensively so we can learn how to -- to improve it. But we'll only be treating a small number of patients, and those trials won't begin for many months. \n\n \n\n KING: I ask one more layman's question, then go back to the doctor to close this. But you're in a difficult position, I assume. You're optimistic. You think you're on to something, but you don't want to raise hopes up too much. How difficult is that as a challenge? And what would you say to someone out there who's saying right now am I a year away, maybe, from there being a cure? \n\n \n\n ROSENBERG: Cancer patients deserve optimistic doctors. And I'm optimistic. This is an example of how basic scientific research is being translated into findings that can help cancer patients. And it emphasizes how important modern research is in molecular biology.\n\n \n\n I think as we continue to learn about the processes that are involved in gene insertion into cells and how they function, we're going to improve this whole area of gene therapy quite dramatically. I believe this is just a start. It's a treatment very much in the infancy of its development. And I'm quite optimistic we're going to be able to improve upon it in our studies here at the NCI, but by other investigators around the world, as well. \n\n \n\n KING: Go ahead, Doc.\n\n \n\n SANJAY: And is Mark Origer, is he cured now, Dr. Rosenberg? \n\n \n\n ROSENBERG: We treated Mark in December of 2004. So he's been a little over a year and a half disease-free. We're going to continue to follow him. It's very hard to talk about cure, since we've only begun these treatments almost two years ago. And so we're going to have to follow Mark very carefully. We see him every three months, and we'll continue to do that for the next five years. \n\n \n\n GUPTA: And let me just say, as well, John, I don't know if you know this, but this has been 30 years of Dr. Rosenberg's work. He told me that 30 years ago he met a patient that sort of gave him this idea, and a lot of that's culminated today. So congratulations, as well, Dr. Rosenberg. \n\n \n\n KING: And one last question, Dr. Rosenberg. As you go forward now, is it a question, do you need more money, more support, more help? Or do you have everything you need right now to see how far you can take this?\n\n \n\n ROSENBERG: We're working around the clock to try to improve this. I'm just one member of a big team that's involved in performing these studies here at the National Cancer Institute. We're working as hard as we can. We have the resources we need here at the NCI to perform the work we need to do. \n\n \n\n KING: Dr. Steven Rosenberg, remarkable work at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. Thank you, sir. \n\n \n\n Dr. Sanjay Gupta, thank you for bringing it to us. \n\n \n\n GUPTA: Thank you.\n\n \n\n KING: It's nice to have a little uplifting talk. Very difficult challenge for many Americans, many around the world. Thank you doctors, both. Thank you both. \n\n \n\n And up ahead, a region rocked by war, staring at a chance for peace. The United Nations Security Council moves to end the conflict and killing, and chaos in Darfur. Will the government sign on? \n\n \n\n And priceless pieces of art stolen in a bold heist. They've now been found. We'll tell you who they're by and where they turned up.\n\n \n\n You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.\n\n \n\n (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n \n\n KING: Our Zain Verjee joins us now to look at some other stories making news. \n\n \n\n Hi, Zain. \n\n \n\n VERJEE: Hi, John. \n\n \n\n Sudan is rejecting a resolution passed today by the United Nations Security Council. It would vastly increase the number of peacekeeping troops in Sudan, sending more than 17,000 to the Darfur region. That's where the U.S. government says a genocide campaign has killed thousands of people and displaced millions. \n\n \n\n Israel says it's turned over control of a small border area in Southern Lebanon to Lebanese and international troops. Officials say it's a symbolic move paving the way for a new United Nations force. \n\n \n\n Meanwhile, a conference on rebuilding Lebanon's ended with $940 million pledged by government as well as aid groups. That's almost double what Lebanon had requested to repair damage from a month of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. \n\n \n\n Just a short while ago, Israeli commandos stormed the British embassy in Tel Aviv and captured an armed suicidal man, ending an eight-hour standoff. Israeli media report that the man is a Palestinian from Ramallah and an informer for the Israeli Security Services who's having financial problems and seeking asylum from Britain. \n\n \n\n Art experts in Norway are examining two recovered paintings by the artist Edvard Munch. They were stolen two years ago this month in a bold armed heist of the Munch Museum in Oslo. One of them is a version of the artist's famous work, \"The Scream\". Police aren't really giving any details, though, of how they were recovered -- John. \n\n \n\n KING: Nice to see \"The Scream\" back in the right hands. \n\n \n\n VERJEE: Yes, I do that all of the time. \n\n \n\n KING: This place has that effect. Zain Verjee, thank you very much. \n\n \n\n Federal regulators have issued a new warning for consumers who buy prescription drugs online. The Food and Drug Administration has identified some large Canadian-based web sites it alleges sold counterfeit versions of some popular drugs.\n\n \n\n Our Internet reporter, Jacki Schechner, is standing by with the details -- Jacki. \n\n \n\n JACKI SCHECHNER, CNN INTERNET REPORTER: John, the FDA is focused specifically on this Canadian company, Mediplan Global Health, which says that it has filled more than two million prescriptions for U.S. consumers over the last seven years. \n\n \n\n They run online web sites like RXNorth.com and CanadianDrugStore.com, and the FDA says that some of the medication that has come through this company's shipment may be counterfeit. They say they intercepted thousands of shipments, and there are some counterfeit samples in these 10 categories of drugs. \n\n \n\n You can go to the FDA. Everything from cholesterol lowering drugs to high blood pressure drugs. They also have a list of the web sites that they're concerned about. \n\n \n\n We spoke to Mediplan today. They say they are voluntarily removing these types of drugs from their repertoire until they can retest them and confirm their integrity. They're working with the FDA to find out more specifics -- John. \n\n \n\n KING: Jacki Schechner. News you need. Thank you very much.\n\n \n\n Up next, as Iran ignores the United Nations' nuclear deadline, Jack Cafferty wants to know, do you think the Bush administration plans to attack Iran? Stay with us.\n\n \n\n (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n \n\n KING: Let's check back in with Jack Cafferty in New York. \n\n \n\n Hi, Jack. \n\n \n\n CAFFERTY: John, President Bush this morning said today Iran will face consequences for not complying with the U.N. deadline to stop nuclear activities. The question is, do you think the Bush administration plans at some point to attack Iran? \n\n \n\n Mike writes from in Wisconsin, \"Nothing is out of the question with this warmongering Cowboy in Chief and his posse of rubber-neck 'yes' dolls. Keep the electorate scared in the hopes of winning another election by producing more false intelligence to serve as a stepping stone to another catastrophic failure.\"\n\n \n\n John in Georgia: \"If we bombed Iran a couple of weeks before the election, that would strike my patriotic nerve, and I would definitely vote Republican again.\" \n\n \n\n Roxie writes from Minnesota, \"Jack, President Bush empowered Iran by taking out Iran's two enemies, the Taliban and Iraq. I do not forgive President Bush for such a major failure of foreign policy. I never voted for him, but unlike Iraq, which I never believed was a threat to the world, Iran does represent a significant danger to the world. I will support any actions to Bush ad administration takes to keep nuclear technology out of the hands of the radical Islamic leaders of Iran.\"\n\n \n\n Ed in Texas: \"Only if Karl Rove thinks it will help them win the midterms.\"\n\n \n\n Chris writes, \"George Bush can't stop short now. The world will be a better place for all without terrorism and it all starts in Iran. You go, George. I'm your biggest fan. One thing, though. I'm Canadian!\"\n\n \n\n Andy writes from Virginia, \"Jack, the question fascinated me so much I went to the Vegas home page. The over/under on war with Iran is off the big board. Vegas thinks it's a sure thing.\" \n\n \n\n And one guy wrote: \"Yes, Jack, it's going to happen in October. It's a surprise.\" \n\n \n\n If you didn't see your e-mail here, go to CNN.com/CaffertyFile, where you can read more of them on the Internet -- John. \n\n \n\n KING: A spirited debate. Thank you, Jack.\n\n \n\n Smokers are breathing in more nicotine than they were six years ago. That's according to a new report from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. \n\n \n\n How are the major tobacco companies responding? Well, if you're looking for an answer online, you may be out of luck. Jacki Schechner explains -- Jacki. \n\n \n\n SCHECHNER: Well, John, we went online to see what was available for consumers with regard to big tobacco. And the Philip Morris web site is up and running. But the R.J. Reynolds web site and the Lorillard web site are not. Both have notices on their web site, saying that they are under review by the company. \n\n \n\n We put in multiple calls to both companies, and Lorillard couldn't find anyone who would speak with us. But R.J. Reynolds says this has nothing to do with the Massachusetts study. It actually has to do with the U.S. District Court ruling that ruled in favor of the Department of Justice, saying that tobacco companies were intentionally deceiving the public when they talk about smoking and health. \n\n \n\n So R.J. Reynolds says it pulled down its web site to reevaluate what statements it should have online regarding public health, or reworking the web site in light of the decision and they -- what they say is the upcoming appeal. \n\n \n\n As for that Massachusetts study about the increase in the amount of nicotine we are inhaling when we smoke, you can go to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. They have that full study online -- John.\n\n \n\n KING: Jacki Schechner. That study still there. Jacki, thank you very much.\n\n \n\n And remember, we're here every weekday afternoon from 4 to 6 Eastern, and we're back on the air at 7 p.m. Eastern.

If a person simply stands, the muscles accommodate and do most of the work, he said - with no benefit to the bone.\n\nAn estimated 10 million Americans, 80 percent of them women, have osteoporosis, sometimes referred to as the \"bone-thinning disease.\" Another 34 million are at risk because they have low bone density.\n\nWalking has not been shown to restore bone that is already lost to osteoporosis, but it can help preserve the bone density that a person has, said Dr. Carol Hartigan, a spine specialist at New England Baptist Hospital. Everyone loses some bone with aging - women abruptly at menopause when estrogen levels decline, men more slowly as male hormones decline over time.\n\nBeyond walking, weight lifting and other resistance training may improve bone mineral density in the lower back, and maintain bone density in the hips. Resistance equipment that addresses this area includes the back extension, abdominal and leg press, hip abduction and adduction, and hamstring and gluteal press machines. Other exercises - such as front and lateral raises with free weights - focus on the spine at chest level.\n\nIf you already have osteoporosis, check with your doctor before embarking on a weight lifting program because if you try to lift too much weight too soon, you could fracture a bone.

Four years after the procedure, patients over 65 who had coronary artery bypass surgeries (called CABG or \"cabbages\") were almost 20 percent less likely to die.\n\nPut another way, 21 percent of stented patients had died after four years compared with 16 percent of surgery patients.\n\nIs that a big difference? Well, the study's lead author tells Shots that it might be enough to \"tip the balance a little bit, but not overwhelmingly so.\"\n\nThe National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, which funded the study with new \"stimulus\" money from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, is more bullish on the implications.\n\n\"We would hope a study as powerful as this one will inform decision-makers to rethink the direction they're going in,\" the NHLBI's Dr. Michael Lauer told Shots. He says it's been worrying that so many doctors have been opting for stenting over surgery.\n\nStudy author Dr. William Weintraub, chief of cardiology at Christiana Care Health System in Newark, Del., is presenting the data at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology in Chicago. The study also appears online in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nIt draws on data from more than 86,000 patients across the nation who underwent CABG operations and nearly 104,000 patients who had coronary stenting. They had blockages in either two or three coronary arteries but did not require emergency procedures.\n\nAlthough the pro-surgery outcome is not a game-changer, Weintraub says it might cause some doctors and patients to consider surgery. And he says it supports those who now opt for CABGs.\n\n\"It's a very big deal to recommend coronary surgery to patients,\" Weintraub says. \"I think doctors work very hard to weigh what's best for their patients. When doctors recommend surgery, these data suggest that that decision is a good one.\"\n\nBut Dr. Laura Mauri says in an accompanying editorial that the new study can't settle any debates. Only studies that randomly assign comparable patients to surgery or stenting can do that. Mauri is an interventional cardiologist \u2013 i.e., a specialist who does coronary stenting \u2013 at Brigham and Women's Hospital inBoston.\n\nWeintraub notes it's \"very difficult and expensive\" to do randomized studies on this question \u2013 and to make the comparison groups truly comparable. And while such a study is being done, the technology (especially stenting technology) changes.

They recommended any pregnancy after weight-loss surgery be considered high-risk and receive stricter monitoring.\n\n\"The number of women who are obese in early pregnancy has increased dramatically over the last decades,\" said study author Kari Johansson, a postdoctoral researcher and nutritionist at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. \"Consequently, there has been a dramatic rise in the number of women becoming pregnant after bariatric surgery,\" she added.\n\n\"The positive effects of bariatric surgery on health outcomes -- such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease -- are reasonably well-studied, but less is known about the effects on pregnancy and [post-delivery] outcomes,\" Johansson pointed out.\n\nThe study was published online Feb. 26 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nU.S. health officials say more than one-third of American adults are obese, with a body mass index (BMI, a height-weight calculation) of 30 or higher.\n\nNearly 179,000 obese people underwent weight-loss surgery in the United States in 2013, according to the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery. While various techniques may be used, the surgery restricts the amount of food the stomach can hold and/or reduces the intestines' absorption of calories and nutrients from food.\n\nJohansson and her colleagues used data from nationwide Swedish health registries to compare pregnancies between nearly 600 women who had given birth after bariatric surgery and more than 2,300 women who hadn't had the surgery but had the same BMI.\n\nOnly 2 percent of women who had weight-loss surgery developed gestational diabetes, compared to 7 percent of the other group, the researchers said. The surgical group was also much less likely to give birth to larger-than-normal babies.\n\nHowever, the weight-loss surgery group was twice as likely to give birth to babies considered small for their gestational age, and their pregnancies were also of slightly shorter duration. Additionally, the surgical group experienced a slight bump in the rate of stillbirths, the study found.\n\nThe investigators didn't examine what might have caused smaller babies among bariatric surgery recipients, or higher stillbirths. But Johannson said those outcomes might be due to reduced nutrient absorption resulting from the surgery, with a fetus not receiving sufficient nutrition.\n\n\"It has been reported that gastric bypass [a form of bariatric surgery] increases the risk of protein, iron, vitamin B12, vitamin D and calcium deficiencies,\" she said. \"Also, many women in our study may have been continuing to lose weight when they became pregnant. Continued weight loss may affect fetal nutrition and could influence growth.\"\n\nBecause obesity is linked to poor outcomes for expectant mothers and babies -- including birth defects, gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, premature birth and even childhood obesity -- efforts to lose weight before pregnancy are important, said Dr. Aaron Caughey, chair of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health and Science University's School of Medicine.\n\nBut Caughey, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new research, said women considering weight-loss surgery should make the decision based on the long-term health benefits of the procedure -- not on potential pregnancy-related benefits.\n\n\"I don't think pregnancy should be the thing that tips the scale,\" said Caughey. \"I don't think the evidence from this study is enough to say now that you should absolutely get this surgery so you have a better pregnancy outcome.\"\n\nCaughey agreed with the researchers that any pregnancy occurring after weight-loss surgery merits a higher level of monitoring and should be considered high-risk.\n\nHe also noted that some experts advise women who undergo weight-loss surgery before pregnancy to delay conceiving until 12 to 24 months after the procedure, the period when the most rapid weight loss occurs.\n\n\"I think a conversation with someone who takes care of complicated pregnancies, a maternal-fetal medicine doctor, is a good idea,\" Caughey said.\n\nThe American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery offers more about weight-loss surgery.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The article quotes the independent source who wrote the editorial that came with the research article.

Made from parallel strands of the protein collagen, it refracts light to focus images on the retina.\n\nAlthough the fragile film is easily destroyed by trauma or infection, replacement human corneas can be used to restore vision, although this depends on a steady supply of donors.\n\nA team led by Griffith and Per Fagerholm, an ophthalmology professor and eye surgeon at Linkoping University in Sweden, conducted the study by removing diseased tissue from the corneas of 10 patients and replacing them with biosynthetic implants designed to mimic a normal human cornea.\n\nFor the process they used recombinant human collagen, a substance synthesized in the laboratory to mimic human tissue and supplied by the San Francisco biotech firm FibroGen Inc.\n\nThe patients were monitored for two years after surgery. The researchers found that, eventually, the cells and nerves from nine of the 10 patients regrew completely and packed themselves into the implant, resulting in a kind of \u201cregenerated\u201d cornea that looked and functioned like normal, healthy eye tissue.\n\nThe biosynthetic corneas also became sensitive to touch and the treated eyes began producing normal tears, the researchers said.

And this strategy \u2026 could potentially be used,\u201d said Dr. Jean-Michel Molina, head of infectious diseases at Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris and the lead author of the study.\n\nMolina insisted he would never support long-term use of antibiotics to prevent STIs, but said that the approach might be an effective short-term strategy when paired with other control approaches, like more frequent STI testing among high-risk populations.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want this strategy to be used widely in any person, clearly,\u201d Molina said. \u201cBut if you can select a group with a high incidence rate of syphilis or chlamydia, and you want to try to reduce the rate of syphilis quite quickly in this group of people, you may think that this strategy could be used for a couple of months.\u201d\n\nRates of syphilis in particular have risen steadily in recent years; the rate in 2015-2016 \u2014 8.7 cases per 100,000 people \u2014 was the highest since 1993, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. The rate of infection increased in every age group over the age of 15, in both men and women, and in all ethnic groups.\n\nMolina\u2019s study was recently published by the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was one of its funders.\n\nThe researchers randomly assigned 232 men to one of two groups. One of the groups was given antibiotics \u2014 the drug doxycycline \u2014 to take if they had unprotected sex. They were told to take two pills per encounter, and no more than six in a week, ideally within 24 hours and no later than 72 hours after the intercourse. In reality, the median use among the men was about 6.8 pills per month.\n\nThe men were tested regularly for STIs, and in the nine or so months they were followed, the rates of some sexually transmitted infections fell dramatically in the treatment group. The overall reduction of all STIs was 47 percent, but that average was dragged down by the fact that doxycycline doesn\u2019t cure gonorrhea.\n\nThere was, however, a 70 percent reduction in chlamydia infections and cases of syphilis decreased by 73 percent. The authors noted, however, that the study length was short and they can\u2019t tell if the strategy would work as well over the long term.\n\nThe results can\u2019t be taken in isolation, others experts warned. Using doxycycline this way could drive the bacteria that cause the infections to develop resistance to the drug, warned Dr. Brad Spellberg, an infectious diseases specialist and chief medical officer at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center in Los Angeles.\n\nSpellberg also said people who used the drug this way would be exposing the bacteria they have in their gastro-intestinal tracts \u2014 their own gut flora \u2014 to regular doses of doxycycline. And those bacteria too could develop resistance to the drug, leading to a host of other health problems.\n\nThe full picture of the knock-on effects of exposing your gut flora to antibiotics is still coming into focus, said Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics, and Policy and a leading voice on the dangers of mounting antibiotic resistance. He noted a recent report in the journal Science revealed that some cancer immunotherapy drugs worked less well in people who had recently taken antibiotics.\n\nMolina noted that antibiotic resistance to doxycycline has not been seen in chlamydia or syphilis, despite the fact that the drug has been used to treat these infections for decades. Still, he said the possibility it could arise cannot be discounted.\n\nA commentary published with the study argued that reducing infection rates in men who have sex with men and who are highly sexually active might lower STI infection rates more generally in a community.\n\nAuthors Christopher Fairley and Eric Chow, of Australia\u2019s Melbourne Sexual Health Center at Monash University, said pressure from patients to be given doxycycline on a preventative basis might be substantial, given that the drug is also prescribed in six-month courses to treat acne. Like Molina and his co-authors, they said STI preventive use at this point is premature.\n\nLaxminarayan did not dismiss the notion of this type of use out of hand, however. \u201cI certainly think that for a small subset of the population, if this helps prevent syphilis, then it certainly is worth exploring further,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he said additional studies should be conducted first to try to get a better picture of the potential consequences of using doxycycline this way, including the risk of resistance developing, the potential that it might further erode condom use, and any other unintended consequences.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "A strength of the story is that it includes multiple independent sources.

This suggests that including the scans in routine care would not lead to a surge in costly tests or additional heart surgery, the researchers say.\n\nPatients who are at risk of a heart attack are frequently diagnosed with a test called an angiogram. This involves inserting tubes into the body and heart to check the flow of blood and identify any obstructions that could pose a heart attack risk.\n\nCTA scans enable doctors to look at the blood vessels from the outside the body, without the need to insert tubes into the heart. The scans are cheaper, quicker and safer than angiograms.\n\nThe study had previously found that around a quarter of patients had their diagnoses reclassified after receiving the scan, prompting new treatments in many cases.\n\nThis is the first study to look at the impact of the scans on long-term survival rates.\n\nLead researcher Professor David Newby, of the BHF Centre for Cardiovascular Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: \"This relatively simple heart scan ensures that patients get the right treatment.

Hands-only CPR is simpler and easier to remember and removes a big barrier for people skittish about the mouth-to-mouth breathing.\n\n\"You only have to do two things. Call 911 and push hard and fast on the middle of the person's chest,\" said Dr. Michael Sayre, an emergency medicine professor at Ohio State University who headed the committee that made the recommendation.\n\nHands-only CPR calls for uninterrupted chest presses - 100 a minute - until paramedics take over or an automated external defibrillator is available to restore a normal heart rhythm.\n\nThis action should be taken only for adults who unexpectedly collapse, stop breathing and are unresponsive. The odds are that the person is having cardiac arrest - the heart suddenly stops - which can occur after a heart attack or be caused by other heart problems. In such a case, the victim still has ample air in the lungs and blood and compressions keep blood flowing to the brain, heart and other organs.\n\nA child who collapses is more likely to primarily have breathing problems - and in that case, mouth-to-mouth breathing should be used. That also applies to adults who suffer lack of oxygen from a near-drowning, drug overdose, or carbon monoxide poisoning. In these cases, people need mouth-to-mouth to get air into their lungs and bloodstream.\n\nBut in either case, \"Something is better than nothing,\" Sayre said.\n\nThe CPR guidelines had been inching toward compression-only. The last update, in 2005, put more emphasis on chest pushes by alternating 30 presses with two quick breaths; those \"unable or unwilling\" to do the breaths could do presses alone.\n\nNow the heart association has given equal standing to hands-only CPR. Those who have been trained in traditional cardiopulmonary resuscitation can still opt to use it.\n\nSayre said the association took the unusual step of making the changes now - the next update wasn't due until 2010 - because three studies last year showed hands-only was as good as traditional CPR. Hands-only will be added to CPR training.\n\nAn estimated 310,000 Americans die each year of cardiac arrest outside hospitals or in emergency rooms. Only about 6 percent of those who are stricken outside a hospital survive, although rates vary by location. People who quickly get CPR while awaiting medical treatment have double or triple the chance of surviving. But less than a third of victims get this essential help.\n\nDr. Gordon Ewy, who's been pushing for hands-only CPR for 15 years, said he was \"dancing in the streets\" over the heart association's change even though he doesn't think it goes far enough. Ewy (pronounced AY-vee) is director of the University of Arizona Sarver Heart Center in Tucson, where the compression-only technique was pioneered.\n\nEwy said there's no point to giving early breaths in the case of sudden cardiac arrest, and it takes too long to stop compressions to give two breaths - 16 seconds for the average person. He noted that victims often gasp periodically anyway, drawing in a little air on their own.\n\nAnonymous surveys show that people are reluctant to do mouth-to-mouth, Ewy said, partly because of fear of infections.\n\n\"When people are honest, they're not going to do it,\" he said. \"It's not only the yuck factor.\"\n\nIn recent years, emergency service dispatchers have been coaching callers in hands-only CPR rather than telling them how to alternate breaths and compressions.\n\n\"They love it.

Currently, guidelines reserve breast MRI screening for women who have a strong family history or other specific breast cancer risk factors. MRI screening has not been considered necessary for women at average risk, and there has been resistance to expansion of MRI into this population due, in part, to concern over higher costs.\n\nHowever, with breast cancer remaining a major cause of cancer death in women, there is good reason to pursue the search for improved screening methods, according to the study's lead author, Christiane Kuhl, M.D., chair of the Department of Radiology at RWTH Aachen University in Aachen, Germany.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2013, Dr. Kuhl and colleagues studied breast MRI's impact on 2,120 women, ages 40 to 70, with less than a 15 percent lifetime risk of breast cancer. The women had normal screening mammograms and, in the case of those with dense breast tissue, normal screening ultrasound. Breast MRI detected 60 additional breast cancers, including 40 invasive cancers, for an overall supplemental cancer detection rate of 15.5 per 1,000 women. Of the 60 cancers detected in the study group over the observation period (7,007 screening rounds), 59 were found only using MRI, one was found also by mammography, and none by mammography or ultrasound alone.\n\nAccording to Dr. Kuhl, the results suggest that MRI can serve as a useful supplemental screening tool for women at average risk, especially those with dense mammographic tissue, and that MRI is superior to supplemental ultrasound for this purpose.\n\nThe results also highlight the ability of MRI in the detection of more aggressive types of cancer.\n\n\"The faster a cancer grows and the better it is in seeding metastases, the better will it be picked up early by MRI,\" Dr. Kuhl said. \"In our cohort, cancers found by MRI alone exhibited features of rapid growth at pathology.\"\n\nThis ability is especially important in women with dense breast tissue in which aggressive cancers may be missed on mammography. Left undetected, these cancers will grow to become clinically palpable cancers, also known as interval cancers. The new study showed that, consistent with previous research, breast MRI can depict these rapidly growing cancers with high reliability.\n\nAccording to Dr. Kuhl, interval cancers exhibit an adverse biologic profile and are the main driver of breast cancer mortality. Additional cancers detected by MRI screening in the study had a skewed distribution towards a higher-than-normal prevalence or incidence of rapidly growing (grade 3) cancers.\n\n\"The interval cancer rate in our study was zero percent. Not a single cancer was undetected that became palpable,\" she said. \"This suggests that MRI finds breast cancers that also mammography would find, but MRI detects them earlier, and it finds the cancers which, if MRI had not been done, would have progressed to interval cancers.\"\n\n\"Supplemental Breast MR Imaging Screening of Women with Average Risk of Breast Cancer.\" Collaborating with Dr. Kuhl were Kevin Strobel, M.D., Heribert Bieling, M.Sc., Claudia Leutner, M.D., Hans H.

In some cases, researchers report, the benefits of massage lasted for six months or longer.\n\nResearchers headed by epidemiologist Daniel Cherkin, a senior investigator at Group Health Research Institute in Seattle, enrolled 401 people with chronic low back pain and no identifiable reason for the pain.\n\nStudy participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatments. One group received full-body relaxation massage. A second received targeted deep tissue massage. The third group got the usual care \u2014 medication and physical therapy.\n\nIn relaxation massage, often referred to as Swedish massage, a variety of maneuvers are used to promote a feeling of relaxation throughout the body and muscles. Structural massage, commonly referred to as deep tissue massage, targets specific pain related tissues, ligaments and joints.\n\nAfter 10 weeks, the results were dramatic: Nearly two-thirds of the patients who received either type of weekly massage said their back pain was significantly improved or gone altogether. Only about one-third of patients receiving the usual care experienced similar relief.\n\n\"We found that both types of massage were equally effective in helping people improve their function and diminish their symptoms,\" Cherkin says. He says massage relieved the pain for six months or more.\n\nPrior studies of massage for back pain had tested only structural forms of massage, not relaxation massage. But relaxation massage is more widely available, and it's often less costly.\n\nPeggy O'Brien-Murphy was among the study participants. In her late 60s, a retired state employee, O'Brien Murphy tried just about everything to get rid of the pain in her lower back.

After each session she walked around the block, standing straighter and walking further each time. By the end, she felt \"back to normal,\" with a \"spring to my walk and some energy in it!\"\n\nFor O'Brien-Murphy, the massage-therapy experience has been life-changing: She has traveled to China, where she walked all over without problems, and she's already planning her next trips.\n\nNo one knows exactly how massage works to relieve pain, says Dr. Richard Deyo of Oregon Health Sciences University, who also took part in the study.\n\n\"It may be that it helps with relaxation of muscles that are tense,\" Deyo says. \"But it may also be there are simply more generalized effects of relaxation \u2014 in the caring and attention and someone laying hands on \u2014 that may all be important.\"\n\nResearchers say future studies should look more closely at the benefits of massage and focus on cost-benefit analysis.\n\nAs for O'Brien-Murphy, she remains free of back pain, but not without some effort on her part.

Cornelius Melief, from the Leiden University Medical Center, Netherlands, said in an accompanying News & Views article that controlled, randomized Phase II clinical trials will be needed to work out if the vaccines are effective. He added, however, that the studies confirm the potential of cancer vaccines.\n\nElizabeth Williams, from the School of Biomedical Sciences at Queensland University of Technology, tells Newsweek the two studies \u201cdescribe tantalizing complementary and consistent results in Phase 1 trials in melanoma patients using vaccines.\"\n\n\"The vaccines are personalized for each individual\u2019s tumours by harnessing technologies that enable the comprehensive analysis of the molecular fingerprint of the tumour,\u201d she says. \u201cThe data shows that it is a safe and well tolerated strategy that stimulates relevant anti-tumor immune responses.\u201d\n\nHowever, the treatment has its downsides: \u201cAs the vaccine therapies are designed and generated specifically for each individual there is a lag time from enrollment to commencement of treatment\u2014approximately four months\u2014which may be too long from some patients with advanced cancer. As technologies and processes continue improve this is likely to be reduced,\" she continues.\n\n\u201cIt is still unknown whether these vaccines will extend the survival of cancer patients, or whether they are more effective than other recently developed immunotherapies. Additional clinical trials will be required to determine the utility of these individualised neoepitope vaccines.\u201d\n\nCatherine Pickworth, science communication officer at Cancer Research UK said: \u201cThe promising results from these two small, early-stage studies show that personalized cancer vaccines designed to treat skin cancer are safe to use, and that for some patients, they can successfully harness the power of the body\u2019s own immune system to kill cancer cells. The next step will be to test these personalized vaccines in larger clinical trials to see if they are better than existing treatments, if they improve survival, and what their long-term side effects could be.\u201d", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story incorporates insights from a few independent sources.

The vaccine has been tested, but never under real-world conditions in regular doctors\u2019 offices.\n\nThe study, led by Hung Fu Tseng, a research scientist at Kaiser Permanente in Southern California, compared about 75,000 vaccinated members of the Kaiser Permanente Health plan with about 225,000 similarly aged members who weren\u2019t vaccinated.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know how well the vaccine actually performed in the community setting,\u201d Tseng told Reuters Health.\n\nShingles is a viral disease produced by the chicken pox virus, a common childhood disease, and is characterized by pain and a blistering rash along the nerves that have housed the dormant virus.\n\nMost shingles patients are older adults, but people with a weak immune system or those under stress may also develop it.\n\nEveryone in the study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, was at least 60 years old, and the researchers didn\u2019t include anybody for whom the live vaccine is not recommended.\n\nUsing electronic health records, researchers tracked patients for up to three years after vaccination.\n\nAbout six out of every 1,000 people vaccinated got shingles each year, compared to 13 of every 1,000 unvaccinated patients. Researchers calculated that for every 71 people who were vaccinated, one case of shingles was prevented.\n\nBut researchers cautioned that because they did not follow patients over the longer term, they didn\u2019t know how effective the vaccine is years later.\n\nDespite the FDA\u2019s approval, the vaccine has not caught on as much as some had hoped.\n\nCost is one hurdle, with the vaccine sometimes costing up to $200 for people whose insurance doesn\u2019t cover it. It also requires stringent storage and handling.\n\n\u201cThe human cost of shingles is enormous,\u201d said Michael Oxman, who studies infectious diseases at the University of California, San Diego, and was involved in a previous study of the vaccine.\n\n\u201cAdult medicine is really geared toward diagnosis and treatment of existing diseases.

But the amount of calcium in arteries can give a good idea of the presence or extent of coronary artery disease.\n\nDr. Krumholz and Dr. Khurram Nasir, a preventive cardiologist at Baptist Health South Florida, who conceived the new study, reasoned that research on heart scans had not been designed to help doctors make treatment decisions they face today.\n\nCurrent guidelines have vastly increased the number of people who are eligible to take statins. Many people, though, are reluctant to take them. So, the investigators asked, could a scan identify those whose actual risk is lower than what was calculated?\n\nThe study subjects were nearly 4,000 men and women ages 45 to 84 and included blacks, whites, Hispanics and Asians who were recruited in 2000 through 2002. According to today\u2019s guidelines, half had risk scores high enough that a statin would be recommended or should be considered. But guidelines then were more conservative, and in accordance with them, the subjects did not take the drugs. All had heart scans, and half had no calcium visible on the scans. The subjects were followed for 10 years.\n\nIt turned out that the actual incidence of heart attacks or disabling chest pain in those with zero calcium was half or less than what the risk calculator predicted.\n\nFor example, a person who, according to the current risk calculator, has a 12 percent risk of a heart attack in the next decade should take a statin, the guidelines say. But if that person has a calcium score of zero, the actual risk turned out to be 4 percent, below the 7.5 percent threshold for recommending a statin according to the guidelines and below the 5 percent risk for considering a statin.\n\nDr. Nasir said he has been using the study\u2019s findings in his clinic. First, he asks patients for whom statins are recommended according to the current guidelines if they would want to avoid taking the drugs if they turn out to have a calcium score of zero and an actual risk of less than 5 percent.

The other patients were given a combination of four chemotherapy drugs, (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, fluorouracil and leucovorin) known as FOLFIRINOX. The treatments lasted for six months. The purpose of the study was to record the overall survival rates of each group.\n\nResearchers found that even though people on the FOLFIRINOX had a longer average survival rate of 11.1 months, versus the gemcitabine group with 6.8 months, the quality of life for patients on FOLFIRINOX was not as good. At least 5% of patients on the drug combination suffered from low white blood cell counts, fatigue, serious diarrhea, a loss of feeling in their feet and hands, as well as hair loss. After six months, only 31% of patients on FOLFIRINOX reported a decent quality of life, compared with 66% of those on gemcitabine.\n\nInvestigators concluded that although the FOLFIRINOX did improve survival rates over gemcitabine, the toxicity of the drug combination caused numerous negative side effects.

This is huge,\u201d said Regina Vidaver, executive director of the National Lung Cancer Partnership.\n\nThe researchers said their findings could save thousands of lives. Lung cancer kills 1.2 million people a year globally and it will kill 157,000 people in the United States alone this year, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nThe trial of more than 53,000 current and former heavy smokers, aged 55 to 74, found the \u201cspiral\u201d CT scans apparently catch tumors before they have spread.\n\n\u201cTo me this is a game changer,\u201d Vidaver said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe will have what breast cancer has now, which is a lot of survivors.\u201d\n\nThe researchers have some caveats.

They were followed for five years.\n\nThe researchers waited until an independent panel could document a 20 percent reduction in cancer deaths, or could determine that there was no significant benefit.\n\nAs of last month, 354 people who got CTs had died of lung cancer, compared to 442 who got ordinary X-rays. This worked out to a 20.3 percent lower risk of dying for the spiral CT group, and researchers stopped the study.\n\nCaught early, lung cancer can be cured surgically, but it causes vague symptoms and usually is not diagnosed until it has spread.

Dr. Nagele's work focuses on utilizing autoantibodies as blood-based biomarkers to accurately detect the presence of myriad diseases and pinpoint the stage to which a disease has progressed. By detecting Alzheimer's disease long before symptoms emerge, Dr. Nagele hopes those with disease-related autoantibody biomarkers will be encouraged to make beneficial lifestyle changes that may help to slow development of the disease.\n\n\"There are significant benefits to early disease detection because we now know that many of the same conditions that lead to vascular disease are also significant risk factors for Alzheimer's. People found to have preclinical disease can take steps to improve their vascular health, including watching their diet, exercising and managing any weight and blood pressure issues to help stave off or slow disease progression,\" Nagele said.\n\nWhile the cause of Alzheimer's remains elusive, it is clear that maintaining a healthy blood-brain barrier is a critical preventative measure. Diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, stroke and being overweight jeopardize vascular health. As blood vessels in the brain weaken or become brittle with age, they begin to leak, which allows plasma components including brain-reactive autoantibodies into the brain. There, the autoantibodies can bind to neurons and accelerate the accumulation of beta amyloid deposits, a hallmark of Alzheimer's pathology.\n\nThe blood test developed by Dr. Nagele has also shown promise in detecting other diseases, including Parkinsons's, multiple sclerosis and breast cancer. His team's research on the role of autoantibodies explains that:\n\u2022 All humans possess thousands of autoantibodies in their blood;\n\u2022 These autoantibodies specifically bind to blood-borne cellular debris generated by organs and tissues all over the body;\n\u2022 An individual's autoantibody profile is strongly influenced by age, gender and the presence of specific diseases or injuries; and\n\u2022 Diseases cause characteristic changes in autoantibody profiles that, when detected, can serve as biomarkers that reveal the presence of the disease.\n\nIn Alzheimer's, the brain begins to change years before symptoms emerge. Detecting Alzheimer's antibodies at the preclinical stage would give patients an opportunity to work with their physician to make lifestyle changes or receive available treatments before they become symptomatic. Potentially, this early intervention could help those with preclinical Alzheimer's avoid or delay the most devastating symptoms.\n\n\"As osteopathic physicians, we constantly tell patients that a healthy lifestyle is the best medicine for preventing disease. We also know that many people tune out messages about nutrition and exercise until a health crisis gets their attention,\" said Jennifer Caudle, DO, assistant professor of family medicine at Rowan University. \"I can't think of a single patient who wouldn't take steps to prevent the progression of Alzheimer's if they could directly affect their prognosis.\"\n\nToday, there is no definitive FDA-approved blood test for Alzheimer's, which affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans. It is among the top 10 causes of death in America.\n\nDr. Nagele's research has been supported by grants from the Michael J. Fox Foundation and the Osteopathic Heritage Foundation.\n\nOMED 15 is a five-day event offering clinical and research updates in 15 specialties, with an emphasis on osteopathic principles and practices.\n\nThe osteopathic philosophy of medicine takes a whole person approach to prevention, diagnosis and treatment, giving its practitioners a distinct model for clinical problem solving and patient education.

Breast cancer afflicts 1 in 8 women in their lifetime and 1 in 25 die from this disease. Although a number of randomized trials demonstrate the clear benefits of mammography screening in women up to age 74 on reducing mortality, data are sparse in women over the age of 74, especially minorities. In 2010, 41 percent of breast cancer deaths occurred in the more than 19 million women who are between the ages of 65 to 84 years.\n\nIn a new study published in the American Journal of Medicine, Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., senior author and first Sir Richard Doll Professor and senior academic advisor to the dean in the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine at Florida Atlantic University, indicates that black and white women ages 75 to 84 years who had an annual mammogram had lower 10-year breast cancer mortality than corresponding women who had biennial or no/irregular mammograms.\n\nAmong elder women, the American Cancer Society and the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommend regular mammography for ages 65 to 74.\n\nAlthough many guidelines rely on self-reports, Hennekens and his collaborators from Baylor College of Medicine and Meharry Medical College, used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program file linked to the Medicare administrative claims file, which allowed them to identify screening mammography use from 1995 to 2009 from 64,384 non-Hispanic women (4,886 black and 59,498 white). These linked files also permitted them to explore breast cancer mortality differences between elderly black or white women who self-selected for regular annual or biennial mammography screening. The researchers selected 69 as the lower age limit because Medicare coverage of the general population begins at age 65, and the exposure of interest was regular mammography screening in the four years immediately preceding breast cancer diagnosis.\n\nThree mutually exclusive categories were defined: no or irregular mammography; biennial mammography; and annual mammography. They looked at data from non-Hispanic, white or black women; Hispanics were not included because Hispanic white women have substantially lower mortality than non-Hispanic whites, and the number of Hispanic blacks is small. The researchers also measured socioeconomic status looking at median household income, the percentage of individuals living below the poverty level, and whether or not they had a high school education.\n\u2022 White women who had died tended to be older, to have a later stage diagnosis, to have received chemotherapy, and to have a higher socioeconomic status.\n\u2022 White women who died were less likely to have undergone surgery and receive radiation therapy.\n\u2022 Similar characteristics were seen in black women as in white women.\n\u2022 69- to 84-year-old women receiving regular annual screening mammography during the four years immediately preceding breast cancer diagnosis had consistently lower five-year and 10-year risks of breast cancer mortality than women with no or irregular screening regardless of race.\n\u2022 10-year risks were more than three times higher among white and more than two times higher among blacks aged 69 to 84 years with no or irregular screening compared with annual screening.\n\nHennekens notes that further research is needed, but that in the future, the use of regular claims-based surveillance for mammography as a source of data may offer some unique advantages over self-reports.\n\nFrom 1995 to 2005, according to Science Watch, Hennekens was the third most widely cited medical researcher in the world and five of the top 20 were his former fellows and/or trainees. In 2012, Science Heroes ranked Hennekens No. 81 in the history of the world for having saved more than 1.1 million lives, which placed him two ahead of professor Jonas Salk ranked No. 83 for the development of the polio vaccine.

According the CDC, the south and central areas of the country are seeing the most flu infections, with doctors also reporting higher than normal amounts of people with flu-like symptoms.\n\n \n\n Between now and the springtime -- allergy season -- as many as half of us will get a respiratory illness. About a third of those will be the flu.\n\n \n\n A lot of people ask, well, what's the difference? Fever, muscle ache and exhaustion aren't common with colds, but are with flu. Runny nose, sneezing and sore throats are hallmarks of colds, but show up only occasionally with the flu.\n\n \n\n So, how does a person stay germ-free this winter?\n\n \n\n Most important, wash your hands frequently.

That may amount to only 100 or 200 calories difference a day, but there's your several pounds over the winter.\n\n \n\n FEIG: Winter months can also be dreary. The lack of daylight affects the way our body metabolizes food. Hormonal changes take place as the levels of a chemical called serotonin drops in the brain due to lack of sunshine and activity.\n\n \n\n TALLMADGE: When the lack of sunlight causes changes in your serotonin levels, you may start craving more carbohydrate foods -- more sweets, more fattening carbohydrate foods.\n\n \n\n FEIG: So what can you do to avoid winter weight gain? Dieticians and doctors say, rev up your metabolism. Try a winter sport or take a brisk walk. Even going to the gym and doing light weight training can keep the pounds at bay.\n\n \n\n Watch what you eat and drink, especially the alcohol. Hot toddies can keep you warm, but they are loaded with calories.\n\n \n\n And watch the carbs. Lack of serotonin can make you crave goodies that you normally would not eat.\n\n \n\n And let the sunshine in and get out. Get at least 40 minutes of sunlight a day.

If you have a dose of hot sauce every time you eat junk food, you'll avoid the junk food to avoid the pain.\n\n \n\n CLIFFORD WOOLF, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL: One of the major features of pain is to learn to avoid danger. And by taking a swig of Tabasco, you're switching on that avoidance mechanism.\n\n \n\n GUPTA: Researchers say a chemical in hot peppers causes that burning sensation. It's called capsaicin. They already know it can lower blood pressure, cholesterol, even fight some cancers.\n\n \n\n Now they've found that burning sensation of arthritis is like the discomfort you feel after eating chili peppers. Those similarities could help scientists to zero in on what really causes arthritic pain and lead to the development of better painkillers.\n\n \n\n WOOLF: The current analgesics in many patients do not actually reduce their pain. And the other is, many of them have excessive side effects.\n\n \n\n GUPTA: And scientists are studying more hot stuff, like wasabi and hot mustard, to see how those might also unravel the puzzle of pain.\n\n \n\n As for Dr. Antoniades, he thinks he's solved his weight problem. A dose of hot sauce, a little pain and no weight gain.\n\n \n\n (END VIDEO)\n\n \n\n GUPTA (on-camera): Capsaicin is already being used in topical creams to ease pain. But this is the first time scientists are looking at it as a model for pain instead of a remedy.\n\n \n\n Now, on to a story about losing weight, but for a different reason. In this day and age, do politicians have to be thin to win?\n\n \n\n Dan Lothian has the details.\n\n \n\n (BEGIN VIDEO)\n\n \n\n DAN LOTHIAN, CNN BOSTON BUREAU CHIEF: When it comes to picking a president, would you vote for this candidate, or this candidate?\n\n \n\n It's the same person, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who announced he's forming an exploratory committee for the 2008 presidential race. Your choice could reveal what some say is an uphill battle for overweight candidates.\n\n \n\n UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: People look at looks. Let's face it, they do. People are judged on their looks.\n\n \n\n LOTHIAN: Some point out Huckabee jumped into the presidential race after an astounding weight loss, shedding 110 pounds over the last few years.\n\n \n\n This is Huckabee in 2003, and now.\n\n \n\n MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS: Well, I think image is important. But more important is that people see that you can set goals, that you have a sense of discipline and focus.\n\n \n\n LOTHIAN: While diabetes and dire warnings from his doctor forced the two-term Republican governor to confront his weight problem, could the new look lead to more votes?\n\n \n\n ELAINE KAMARCK, DEMOCRATIC CONSULTANT: It's not about looking like Hollywood. It's really about being vigorous enough to convince people that you're healthy and you're up to what can be a very demanding job.\n\n \n\n LOTHIAN: Other politicians have seemingly taken notice, like Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue, who made political hay of his weight loss, and Virginia Lieutenant Governor Bill Bolling, who went public with his big effort to slim down.\n\n \n\n Catherine Steiner Adair, a clinical psychologist at Harvard, says the young people she studied tend to see someone who's thin as in control, intelligent, and just the opposite for someone who's overweight.\n\n \n\n CATHERINE STEINER ADAIR, CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST, HARVARD: We're actually teaching weightism as a form of prejudice in our country, that's just as harmful and cruel and hurtful to people as is racism or sexism.\n\n \n\n LOTHIAN: So, how does so-called weightism play out in presidential politics? America's most notable obese president was William Howard Taft, but he held office nearly a century ago.\n\n \n\n Bill Clinton wasn't obese, but comedians had a field day poking fun at his fast-food habits.\n\n \n\n HUCKABEE: I think they want their leaders to be real and authentic. They don't expect them to be perfect.\n\n \n\n LOTHIAN: It's too soon to tell if Huckabee's weight loss will help him gain votes. But ultimately, experts say, voters should test candidates on how they weigh in on the issues, not on how they weigh in on a scale.\n\n \n\n Dan Lothian, CNN, Boston.\n\n \n\n (END VIDEO)\n\n \n\n GUPTA: Dan, thanks. Interesting report.\n\n \n\n We have more HOUSE CALL just ahead. Is the air around you making you sick? A possible link between pollution and women's heart disease.\n\n \n\n And Elizabeth Cohen brings us the latest on how to look younger, including a permanent fix for wrinkles with no cutting needed.\n\n \n\n All that's coming up on HOUSE CALL.\n\n \n\n (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n \n\n GUPTA: Heart disease kills more women than men each year. That's a fact.\n\n \n\n But according to the American Heart Association, fewer than one in five physicians recognize that -- startling.\n\n \n\n And now a new Mayo Clinic study goes right to the heart of the problem. It shows not only are not enough female hearts studies, but even when they are, the research is not reported by sex, leaving female patients behind. By not separating the findings by gender, it makes it hard to pick up on any differences.\n\n \n\n Now, a new study shows the air we breathe could increase the risk of heart disease and death among women. Research published in the \"New England Journal of Medicine\" measured how the fine particles in air pollution impacted post-menopausal women's hearts.\n\n \n\n What they found was surprising. For every 10-unit increase in fine pollution, the women had a 75 percent increase in their risk of death from heart disease.\n\n \n\n Now, when we say 10 units, know that these particles are so small that 30 units are about equal to the thickness of a strand of human hair.\n\n \n\n Here to explain what this means is Dr. Lori Mosca. She's director of preventive cardiology at New York Presbyterian Hospital. She's also associate professor of medicine at Columbia University.\n\n \n\n Welcome, doctor.\n\n \n\n DR. LORI MOSCA, DIRECTOR OF PREVENTIVE CARDIOLOGY, NEW YORK PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL: Thanks, Sanjay. It's a pleasure to be here.\n\n \n\n GUPTA: Yes. Thanks for being here on HOUSE CALL.\n\n \n\n You know, these particles, they're so tiny -- put it together for us. How do those little particles actually increase someone's risk of heart disease?\n\n \n\n MOSCA: Well, we believe that these fine particles may damage the blood vessels and really affect their function, and also may increase blood pressure, inflammation, clotting. And they've also been associated with an increased risk of diabetes and obesity.\n\n \n\n But one interesting finding is that they have been associated with a dramatic increase in the risk of death due to heart disease. And this may be related to them causing an irregular heart rhythm, which can lead to sudden cardiac arrest.\n\n \n\n GUPTA: Do women seem to be more likely to suffer from the effects of these small particles?\n\n \n\n MOSCA: Well, you know, it's been shown, Sanjay, in previous research that women did have a greater risk associated with these fine particulate matter pollutants.\n\n \n\n However, this particular research study only included women. So we're not really sure if this larger effect is just because we're getting better at the science in terms of measuring pollution and the association with heart disease, or if it's a true gender difference.\n\n \n\n GUPTA: You know, Dr. Mosca, I know you're a preventive cardiologist. I'm always struck by this idea that only one in five physicians even recognize that women and heart disease is such an issue.\n\n \n\n What do you say about that? Where are we missing the boat here?\n\n \n\n MOSCA: Well, you know, it's interesting you brought up that study. That was actually my research paper, a study that I published for the American Heart Association. And I was absolutely shocked at that.\n\n \n\n We've worked so hard to raise awareness of heart disease in women and we've come a long way with the public, but it appears we still have a lot of work to do with ourselves, Sanjay. Even doctors need more education.\n\n \n\n GUPTA: Well, let me -- it's a good point -- let me ask one more question about these particles.\n\n \n\n As you're thinking about it, and people are listening to this, is there anything they can do to protect themselves? Are people in urban centers always going to be more at risk than people who live out in the country?\n\n \n\n MOSCA: Well, it was very interesting in this study, that the variation in air pollution that was found within a city was actually greater than what was found between cities.\n\n \n\n So, I think, you know, that points out to us that wherever we live there's probably areas that are more healthy compared to others.\n\n \n\n So what I suggest is that my patients and my friends, who tend to -- and myself, you know, when I exercise, I try to go to areas where traffic -- where there's not heavy traffic. We know that these fine particles that are in the air, that cause that pollution and that heart disease and stroke, are more likely to be found where there are industrial emissions, where there's combustion of gas and diesel.\n\n \n\n I mean, smog -- we need to pay attention to these levels. And these can actually be monitored on the Environmental Protection Agency Web site.\n\n \n\n GUPTA: Outstanding points. Dr. Lori Mosca, who is joining us from Florida, by the way, thank you very much for talking with us this morning. MOSCA: You're welcome. My pleasure.\n\n \n\n GUPTA: Now let's take a look at more of this week's headlines, coming up in \"The Pulse.\"\n\n \n\n (BEGIN VIDEO)\n\n \n\n JUDY FORTIN, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Researchers report in the \"American Journal for Sports Medicine\" that youth soccer players had 1.6 million E.R. visits over a 13-year span to 2005. They found girls go to the hospital more often for their injuries, but boys are more likely to be admitted.\n\n \n\n A report in the journal \"Neurology\" says that Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis are more common than previously believed. It's unclear if more people are suffering from the diseases, or if detection has simply improved.\n\n \n\n Intensive care unit doctors who spend time talking with a grieving family could be helping more than they think. A study in the \"New England Journal of Medicine\" reveals relatives suffered less anxiety and depression after a loved-one's death, if doctors spent as long as 30 minutes speaking with them about death-related issues.\n\n \n\n Judy Fortin, CNN.\n\n \n\n (END VIDEO)\n\n \n\n GUPTA: All right. Thanks, Judy.\n\n \n\n Coming up, fighting Father Time. New ways to plump up those wrinkles with something that could be permanent. We've got the before and the afters. You're not going to want to miss it.\n\n \n\n And later on the show, report cards for a child's weight. A good thing, or an avenue for more teasing? We take a closer look.\n\n \n\n All of that's ahead on HOUSE CALL.\n\n \n\n (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n \n\n GUPTA: We're back with HOUSE CALL.\n\n \n\n How much younger do you wish you looked? Thirteen years younger. That's the average for women, according to a recent survey by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.\n\n \n\n But forget the face lift. The majority seeking a younger looking face want something less dramatic.\n\n \n\n Elizabeth Cohen now with some new treatments that might help.\n\n \n\n (BEGIN VIDEO)\n\n \n\n DR. LISA AIRAN, COSMETIC DERMATOLOGIST: Trish? Hi. You can come on back. ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Forty- something single mom, Trish Glazer, isn't ready for a face lift, but is ready to look younger.\n\n \n\n TRISH GLAZER, PATIENT: I hope the filler is going to take away the shadows that I don't like and a couple of the lines that I'm unhappy with. And then I'll leave here just looking really great for my age.\n\n \n\n AIRAN: Could you tell me what's bothering you today?\n\n \n\n COHEN: This is what's bothering Glazer, wrinkles around her nose and mouth. She wants them filled in or plumped up.\n\n \n\n And cosmetic dermatologist, Dr. Lisa Airan, is using new facial fillers to do it: one, Radiesse, a synthetic material recently approved by the FDA; another, Juvederm, which contains a substance naturally found in our bodies. Until now, Restylane was the dominant player in the filler market.\n\n \n\n AIRAN: Not everyone's ready for surgery at a certain age, but it's less of a commitment to come in and get an injectable filler.\n\n \n\n COHEN: Fillers are often used on those lines from your nose to your chin called nasal labial folds, and on the frown lines, around the mouth and the lips.\n\n \n\n While results are immediate, they usually last just four to six months. That's why some beauty junkies are excited about ArteFill, billed as the first permanent filler. It's composed of tiny beads wrapped in collagen. But doctors warn, it's not a good choice for first-time users.\n\n \n\n AIRAN: My recommendation would always be to do something that's of a shorter duration, six months or a year, prior to moving to something that's long-lasting or permanent.\n\n \n\n COHEN: But remember, whatever filler you choose, insurance won't pay for it, and it can get very expensive. One visit can cost hundreds, even thousands, of dollars.\n\n \n\n While known side effects are minimal, experts warn it's not as straightforward as plump-and-go.\n\n \n\n DR. ALAN MATARASSO, AMERICAN SOCIETY OF PLASTIC SURGEONS: It's really a buyer beware situation with these products, because they go through a different process of approval than drugs do.\n\n \n\n COHEN: In less than 30 minutes, Glazer was sold. She thought she looked fresh with, if anything, her wallet, not her face, showing fatigue.\n\n \n\n (END VIDEO)\n\n \n\n COHEN (on camera): Now, as we mentioned, facial fillers can be very expensive, which means that they're lucrative for doctors. We've even heard now that dentists and gynecologists are getting into the act of giving people these shots.\n\n \n\n So, who do you look for? What you want to look for is a certified plastic surgeon or a cosmetic dermatologist. You want someone who gives these shots all the time, not just as a side business.\n\n \n\n You also want to ask if the facility where you're going to be getting the shots can handle emergencies, because sometimes things do happen, and you want to make sure that you're at a place that can handle something happening.\n\n \n\n Now, another thing to keep in mind is that you will have some swelling along the injection sites when you get these fillers for a couple of days, for two or three days. So that means that you want to make sure that you don't have some big event planned for the next day. You want some time for your face to come back to normal, as it were -- Sanjay.\n\n \n\n GUPTA: Elizabeth definitely doesn't need any of that stuff. I, on the other hand -- I don't know, I'm going to have to get that checked out. Thank you, Elizabeth.\n\n \n\n There's more to come on HOUSE CALL, including outrage over some schools' treatment of kids.\n\n \n\n (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n \n\n VICKI ELLIOTT, JASMINE'S MOTHER: To receive a letter from the teacher usually says, I got in trouble.\n\n \n\n (END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n \n\n GUPTA: This little girl wasn't in trouble. Instead, the letter talked about her weight. Find out why so many schools are taking similar steps.\n\n \n\n (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n \n\n GUPTA: Welcome back to HOUSE CALL.\n\n \n\n Some school districts around the country are adding a new kind of report card for kids -- fit or fat.\n\n \n\n While kids are becoming more and more overweight, schools are struggling with their role in combating childhood obesity.\n\n \n\n The question is, would you want a report card sent home about your child's weight?\n\n \n\n (BEGIN VIDEO)\n\n \n\n GUPTA (voice-over): Jasmine Talmon (ph) is a happy eight-year- old. She's always enjoyed school.\n\n \n\n But when she got a note in class a few weeks ago, she worried. VICKI ELLIOTT, JASMINE'S MOTHER: To receive a letter from the teacher usually says, I got in trouble. And she wanted to know what it said.\n\n \n\n GUPTA: What Jasmine received was not a letter saying she'd done anything wrong; it was a notice, telling her mother that her daughter was at risk of becoming obese.\n\n \n\n Like many schools across the country, Jasmine's school district in Barnstable County, Massachusetts, is not taking body mass index, or BMI readings, of their pupils in some schools.\n\n \n\n BMI is used to determine body fat. Jasmine was right on the line at 66 pounds. But her mother said the note did nothing but humiliate her.\n\n \n\n ELLIOTT: Why was she receiving a letter, and not everybody got one?\n\n \n\n GUPTA: Because childhood obesity is at epidemic proportions nationwide, many states are now instituting BMI laws for public school children. At least 20 governors have introduced legislation and seven states have passed laws making it mandatory that parents be given their children's BMI scores, with information advising them to check with their pediatrician.\n\n \n\n KENNETH STANTON, UNIVERSITY OF BALTIMORE: This is a change in behavior that we have to implement. It's social engineering. As objectionable as that sounds, we're trying to influence people's attitudes.\n\n \n\n GUPTA: Former Arkansas governor, Michael Huckabee, who lost 110 pounds himself, was the first to push through BMI legislation in the state back in 2003. In three years, Arkansas has actually seen its statewide childhood obesity numbers start to level off.\n\n \n\n HUCKABEE: Now, we're not where we want to be, but we've stopped the runaway train.\n\n \n\n GUPTA: But some parents say it's an invasion of privacy. They feel it's up to parents to work with their children on weight issues. And giving out BMI scores only puts pressure on kids to be slim.\n\n \n\n Health experts disagree, saying it's time that parents realize that obesity is a lifetime illness that can cause serious lifetime problems.\n\n \n\n (END VIDEO)\n\n \n\n GUPTA (on-camera): It's going to be a controversial issue for a long time to come, I think. And since Jasmine received her letter, the Barnstable school board announced it would send BMI reports home to parents through the mail and not single out certain children in the classroom.\n\n \n\n Stay where you are.

Higher soy intake was also associated with less reported fatigue. The breast cancer survivors studied included 173 non-Hispanic white and 192 Chinese Americans including US-born Chinese and Chinese immigrants.\n\nResearchers say breast cancer survivors often experience side effects from cancer treatments that can persist months or years after completion of treatment. For example, because many treatments designed to prevent breast cancer recurrence inhibit the body's production or use of estrogen, the hormone that can fuel breast cancer growth, breast cancer patients often experience hot flashes and night sweats, among other side effects.\n\nThe lead author on the study, Sarah Oppeneer Nomura, PhD, of Georgetown Lombardi, said that while further research is needed in larger study populations and with more detailed dietary data, this project addresses an important gap in research on the possible role of lifestyle factors, such as dietary habits, in relation to side effects of treatments.\n\n\"These symptoms can adversely impact survivors' quality of life and can lead them to stopping ongoing treatments, she says. \"Understanding the role of life style factors is important because diet can serve as a modifiable target for possibly reducing symptoms among breast cancer survivors.\"\n\nWhen study participants were evaluated separately by race/ethnicity, associations were significant among white breast cancer survivors; however; while a trend was seen in the benefit for Chinese women, results were not statically significant. Researchers explain Chinese women typically report fewer menopausal symptoms. Most of them also consume cruciferous vegetables and soy foods, making it difficult to see a significant effect in this subgroup. Indeed, in this study, Chinese breast cancer survivors ate more than twice as much soy and cruciferous vegetables.\n\nWhether the reduction in symptoms accounts for longtime use of soy and cruciferous vegetables needs further investigation, says the study's senior author, Judy Huei-yu Wang, PhD, of Georgetown Lombardi's Cancer Prevention and Control Program.\n\nResults obtained in preclinical studies in animals show that biologically active compounds present in both soy and cruciferous vegetables cause breast cancer cells to grow, but have opposite effects in animals that consume these compounds well before cancer is diagnosed and continue consuming them during and after cancer treatments.\n\nUntil more research is conducted, breast cancer patients should not suddenly start eating soy, if they have not consumed it before, says Leena Hilakivi-Clarke, PhD, a professor of oncology at Georgetown Lombardi and a co-author of the study.\n\nResearchers also found suggestive associations with lower reporting of other symptoms, including joint problems, hair thinning/loss and memory less in women who consumed more soy foods, but these associations did not reach statistical significance.\n\nPhytochemicals, or bioactive food components, such as isoflavones in soy foods and glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables may be the source of the benefit, researchers say. Isoflavones bind to estrogen receptors and exert weak estrogenic effects, among other effects. Glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables influence levels of metabolizing enzymes that can modulate inflammation and levels of estrogen, possibly attenuating treatment-related symptoms.\n\nCo-authors of the study include Chiranjeev Dash, MBBS, MPH, PhD, Leena Hilakivi-Clarke, PhD, and Yun-Ling Zhen, MPH, PhD, from Georgetown Lombardi; Yi-Tin Hwang, PhD, from National Taipei University, Taiwan; Scarlett Lin Gomez, MPH, PhD, from the Cancer Prevention Institute of California; Teresa T.

Good job.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A Veterans Affairs database study of more than 83,000 patients found that men whose low testosterone was restored to normal through gels, patches, or injections had a lower risk of heart attack, stroke, or death from any cause, versus similar men who were not treated.\n\nThe study also found that men who were treated but did not attain normal levels did not see the same benefits as those whose levels did reach normal. The study was published online Aug. 6, 2015, in the European Heart Journal.\n\nThe findings may sway the ongoing debate over testosterone therapy's benefits and risks, especially for the heart. Studies over the past few years have yielded mixed results, although part of that might stem from differing patient populations and research methods.\n\nFor example, the new VA study excluded men with a history of heart attacks or strokes, although it did include those with existing heart disease. A much-cited VA database study that was published in JAMA in 2013 looked specifically at men with coronary artery disease; about 20 percent of the total study group of around 8,700 men had suffered a prior heart attack.\n\nSo far, the medical community lacks results from any definitive clinical trial that might provide clear guidance. Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration issued guidance earlier in 2015 advising clinicians about the over-use of testosterone therapy, and pointing to a possible increased risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\nThe new VA study is likely to draw attention because of its large size and relatively long follow-up period.\n\nDr. Rajat Barua, the paper's corresponding author, says the study is also noteworthy because of its finding that administering the right dose is critical: Treating \"low T\" but not restoring levels to normal doesn't appear to impart much benefit, at least in terms of cardiovascular risk. Testosterone isn't prescribed with the goal of improving heart health, but that is a consideration in many cases.\n\n\"It is the first study to demonstrate that significant benefit is observed only if the dose is adequate to normalize the total testosterone levels,\" Barua and his coauthors wrote. \"Patients who failed to achieve the therapeutic range after testosterone replacement therapy did not see a reduction in [heart attack] or stroke and had significantly less benefit on mortality.\"\n\nBarua is with the Kansas City (Mo.) VA Medical Center. He's also an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Kansas.\n\nThe study team looked at national data on more than 83,000 men with documented low testosterone, all age 50 or above, who received care in VA between 1999 and 2014.\n\nThe researchers divided the men into three clinical groups: those who were treated to the point where their total testosterone levels returned to normal (Group 1); those who were treated but without reaching normal (Group 2); and those who were untreated and remained at low levels (Group 3).\n\nImportantly, all three groups were \"propensity matched\" so the comparisons would be between men with similar health profiles. The researchers took into account a wide array of factors that might affect cardiovascular and overall risk. They included, for example, age, body mass index, various chronic diseases, LDL cholesterol levels, and the use of aspirin, beta blockers, and statins.\n\nThe average follow-up across the groups ranged from 4.6 to 6.2 years.\n\nThe sharpest contrast emerged between Group 1 (those who were treated and attained normal levels) and Group 3 (those whose low testosterone went untreated). The treated men were 56 percent less likely to die during the follow-up period, 24 percent less likely to suffer a heart attack, and 36 percent less likely to have a stroke.\n\nThe differences between Group 1 and Group 2 (those who were treated but did not attain normal levels) were similar but less pronounced.\n\nLittle difference emerged between Groups 2 and 3, except for a slight benefit in survival for those who were treated.\n\nBarua and colleagues say they don't know the exact reasons for testosterone's apparent benefits for the heart and overall survival. \"The mechanisms for these effects remain speculative,\" they write. Possible explanations, they say, could involve body fat, insulin sensitivity, lipids, blood platelets, inflammation, or other biological pathways. More research is needed, they say, to clarify how testosterone affects the cardiovascular system.\n\nWhile the new study results do seem to advocate for testosterone replacement therapy, Barua stresses the need for \"appropriate screening, selection, dosing, and follow-up of patients to maximize the benefit of testosterone therapy.\"\n\nThe authors also caution that \"off-label\" use remains a concern. In other words, doctors should not write a prescription simply because an older man is complaining of symptoms such as low energy and low sex drive. According to the FDA, \"Testosterone products are FDA-approved only for use in men who lack or have low testosterone levels in conjunction with an associated medical condition. Examples of these conditions include failure of the testicles to produce testosterone because of reasons such as genetic problems or chemotherapy. ... None of the FDA-approved testosterone products are approved for use in men with low testosterone levels who lack an associated medical condition.\"", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Although the study itself offers\u00a0full disclosure regarding funding and conflicts of interest (the investigators assert no such conflicts), none of this finds its way into the news release.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "COLUMBIA, Mo. (March 10, 2016) - Approximately 14 percent of men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point in their lifetimes, according to the National Institutes of Health. Radiation therapy traditionally has been a primary treatment for the cancer, but one-fourth of men have a recurrence of prostate cancer within five years after the therapy. Now, a University of Missouri School of Medicine researcher has found that a complex procedure to remove the prostate achieves excellent long-term survival for men after radiation therapy has failed.\n\n\"Prostate cancer, unfortunately, is a common cancer, and more than 27,000 men are estimated to have died from the disease in 2015,\" said Naveen Pokala, M.D., an assistant professor in the Division of Urology at the MU School of Medicine and lead author of the study. \"By studying a national database of prostate cancer cases, we found that a procedure known as salvage radical prostatectomy can greatly increase a man's chance of survival when traditional radiation therapy has failed to eradicate the cancer.\"\n\nUsing the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program database, Pokala and his research team studied 364 patients who underwent a salvage radical prostatectomy surgery after unsuccessful radiation treatments. Looking at survival rates, the researchers found that 88.6 percent of men were still alive 10 years later and 72.7 percent of men were still alive 20 years later.\n\nDuring a salvage radical prostatectomy, the prostate gland and surrounding tissue are surgically removed to keep the cancer from spreading. The procedure is challenging because tissue that surrounds the prostate is scarred during radiation treatment, making it difficult for the surgeon to identify and cut out tissue that needs to be removed. If the cancer is localized, a highly skilled surgeon can remove the gland and surrounding tissue using a robotic minimally invasive technique or through an open surgery.\n\n\"Because radical prostatectomy is a complex surgery, there can be a reluctance to undergo the procedure,\" Pokala said. \"However, this study shows that it is a viable treatment option. This can bring a renewed hope and peace of mind to men living with prostate cancer.\"\n\nThe study, \"Survival Outcomes in Men Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy after Primary Radiation Treatment for Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate,\" recently was published by Clinical Genitourinary Cancer, a peer-reviewed journal on the detection, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of genitourinary cancers.", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "There\u2019s no mention of who funded the study or if there were potential conflicts of interest in the release.

The medication is not available yet, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is reviewing it for possible approval, the researchers said.\n\nIn the United States, about 10 percent of people say they have chronic insomnia, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are sleep aids on the market, but they do not work for everyone and they can have side effects that include sleepwalking, daytime drowsiness and confusion.\n\nSuvorexant works differently from those drugs, zeroing in on specific brain chemicals involved in the ability to sleep, explained study author Dr. William Herring, executive director of clinical research at Merck.\n\nThe study, published online Nov. 28 and in the Dec. 4 print issue of the journal Neurology, included 254 healthy adults with primary insomnia, which means it wasn't caused by an underlying physical or mental health problem.\n\nAll of the patients spent four weeks on one of four doses of suvorexant and another four weeks on placebo pills. They had their sleep monitored in a sleep lab on their first night with each treatment, and then came back again after four weeks.\n\nOverall, Herring's team found, people slept better with the drug, although the improvement was not dramatic.\n\nAt the outset, when patients spent eight hours in bed, they were typically asleep for 66 percent of that time. One day on suvorexant boosted that by anywhere from 5 percent to 13 percent, relative to the placebo. Between 21 and 37 fewer minutes were spent awake during those sleep periods.\n\nThere was still a benefit four weeks later. One expert pointed out, however, that the benefit was small.\n\n\"The amount of additional sleep was not tremendous,\" said Dr. Carl Bazil, director of the division of epilepsy and sleep at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center.\n\nThe effect was essentially comparable to what has been seen with other sleep medications, said Bazil, who was not involved in the research.\n\nBut, he said, suvorexant is seen as a potentially important development in the world of sleep medicine, because the drug blocks specific brain chemicals called orexins, which help keep people awake. Standard sleep medications work more widely throughout the brain, Bazil explained, which is why they can have a host of side effects.\n\n\"The way [suvorexant] works makes a lot of sense,\" Bazil said. \"The hope is that it will help some people who haven't responded to [other drugs], and have fewer side effects.\"\n\nIt's promising news, Bazil added, that there were no serious side effects in this study.\n\nThe most common side effects were sleepiness (reported by about 10 percent of patients on the two higher doses of suvorexant), headache (reported by about 5 percent), dizziness and abnormal dreams (5 percent).\n\nThere are still many questions, including whether the drug would benefit people with insomnia due to a health condition, which doctors call secondary insomnia.\n\nThe study also excluded adults aged 65 or older -- an age group commonly affected by insomnia. But, Herring said, seniors were part of a larger, 12-month trial, and Merck has submitted those results to the FDA.\n\nAnother sleep specialist said the findings show \"some potential benefit\" from suvorexant, but he cautioned insomnia sufferers against relying completely on any drug.\n\n\"Medication can be important,\" said Dr. William Kohler, who directs the Florida Sleep Institute in Spring Hill. \"But in the long run, the best methods for treating insomnia are behavioral techniques.\"\n\nKohler said cognitive behavioral therapy -- where people learn to change the thoughts and habits that affect their sleep quality -- is a proven way to manage insomnia. For most people, he said, medication should be a temporary treatment; behavior change is the long-term fix.\n\nBazil agreed: \"I look at most people with insomnia as someone who developed bad sleep habits.\"\n\nA drug, ideally used for a short time, may help encourage sleep and get people on the right track, Bazil said. \"But those bad sleep habits -- you've got to address them too,\" he added.\n\n\"The problem,\" Kohler noted, \"is that we don't want to make behavior changes. We want to pop a pill.\"\n\nLearn more about insomnia and good sleep habits from the National Sleep Foundation.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Two independent sources added needed balance up against the comments of Merck\u2019s director of clinical research.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "LONDON -- AstraZeneca PLC said Monday its experimental heart pill Brilinta was more effective at preventing heart attacks and strokes in a large clinical trial than the blockbuster pill Plavix, boosting commercial prospects for the U.K. drug maker's still unmarketed treatment.\n\nPlavix, which is marketed by Sanofi-Aventis SA and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., was the second-biggest-selling drug in the world last year, with global revenue of $8.6 billion, according to IMS Health.

But, researchers believe it may interact with a brain receptor that plays a role in the development of seizures, Devinsky said.\n\n\"This receptor has several effects, but one of them may be to modulate the calcium inside and outside the neuron, which is very much related to the excitability of nerve cells,\" he explained.\n\nPrevious studies have shown some benefit in adults, and word has spread. Families with adults and children with epilepsy have flocked to states where medical marijuana is legal to seek treatment, Brooks-Kayal said.\n\n\"There is a fairly active and vocal group of families in Colorado who are using cannabidiol oils that are made artisanally,\" she said.\n\nTo see whether children with epilepsy would benefit from cannabidiol treatment, Devinsky led a study involving 261 people, mostly children, whose seizures had not been controlled using current anti-seizure medications. The average age of the participants was 11.\n\nEveryone received a British-made cannabidiol oil called Epidiolex, which was administered as a drop on the tongue, Devinsky said. This was in addition to their current drug therapy.\n\nAfter three months, seizure frequency declined by an average 45 percent in all participants. Almost half experienced a 50 percent or greater reduction in seizures, and about one of every 10 patients became seizure-free, the study found.\n\n\"This was a very, very treatment-resistant group, and the response was very promising,\" Devinsky said.\n\nA second study from the University of California, San Francisco, explored the long-term effectiveness of cannabidiol for children with epilepsy, by adding the marijuana-derived oil to the regular drug regimen of about 25 kids for one year.\n\nThe study found that after a year, the treatment resulted in a 50 percent reduction in seizures for 10 participants -- about 40 percent of the group. One child remained seizure-free, but 12 of the initial participants dropped out of the study because the cannabidiol didn't seem to do them any good.\n\nAlthough he said he would prescribe CBD to people with uncontrolled seizures, Devinsky said he is \"very anxious\" to see the results of ongoing randomized, controlled clinical trials. The results of one major trial are expected in the first quarter of 2016, he added.\n\nIf CBD proves effective in controlled trials, it could be two to five years before the drug is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Devinsky noted.\n\nFederal regulators also will have to weigh potential interactions of cannabidiol with other anti-seizure drugs. Another study scheduled for presentation at the meeting found that CBD appeared to enhance the effects of the epilepsy medication levetiracetam (Keppra), when given to lab mice.\n\nHowever, the oil appeared to interact negatively with two other drugs, clobazam (Onfi) and carbamazepine (Tegretol), the University of Utah researchers found.\n\nData and conclusions presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.\n\nFor more on medical marijuana, visit the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Although the story does make clear the distinction between researchers involved in the studies discussed and those not involved, there is no mention of funding.

She is also president of HealthStat Consulting Inc. in Seattle.\n\nThe new study, like previous ones, re-ignites the ongoing debate about the best age to start routine mammograms and the best screening interval. It appears in the March issue of the journal Radiology.\n\nIn 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued mammogram recommendations. It recommends women aged 50 to 74 who are at average risk for breast cancer have a mammogram done every two years. It also suggests that women aged 40 to 49 at average risk discuss the pros and cons with their doctors and decide on an individual basis if and when to start screening.\n\nMeanwhile, other organizations, including the American Cancer Society, recommend women begin mammograms at age 40 and continue to have them annually.\n\nMalmgren and her colleagues evaluated nearly 2,000 women who had breast cancer. All were aged 40 to 49 when they were treated between 1990 and 2008.\n\nThe researchers looked at the method of diagnosis, whether by mammogram or if the cancer was found by the doctor or the woman. They also took these into account: the cancer's stage at diagnosis; type of treatment; annual follow-up; recurrence; and survival.\n\nOver the 18-year period, the number of breast cancers diagnosed at very early stages increased 66 percent, while the number of more advanced cancers (stage 3) decreased by 66 percent.\n\nThose whose cancers were detected by mammogram rose from 28 percent in 1990 to 58 percent in 2008. The number of cancers detected by doctor or patients declined from 73 percent in 1990 to 42 percent in 2008.\n\nWomen whose cancers were detected by mammograms were more likely than the doctor- or patient-detected cancers to have lumpectomy or other breast-conserving surgery: 67 percent vs. 48 percent. The women whose cancers were detected by mammograms were less likely to be given chemotherapy.\n\nWhile 4 percent of women whose cancer was found on mammogram died during a follow-up period that ranged from one to 20 years, 11 percent of those whose cancers were found by the doctor or the women died.\n\nWhen the researchers looked only at invasive cancers, 92 percent of the women whose cancer was found on mammogram survived without recurrence at five years; 88 percent of the other group did.\n\n\"I don't think the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force is looking at the whole picture,\" Malmgren said. \"They are concentrating on the harms.\"\n\nAmong them, according to the 2009 guidelines, are false-positives, which can lead to anxiety and unnecessary biopsies.\n\nMalmgren, a breast cancer survivor, says more focus should be placed on the benefit of early diagnosis, because it often means less treatment is needed.\n\nThere was a decrease found in cancers being diagnosed at later stages in those whose cancers were found on mammograms. \"That's where the money is,\" Malmgren said.\n\nDr. Virginia Moyer, chair of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and a professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine, reviewed the study. \"The findings make sense,\" she said.\n\nThey found that cancers can be detected earlier by mammogram. \"A screening test, if it can't find something earlier than [by] clinical presentation, is a poor test,\" she said.\n\nHowever, she said, the study does not provide support for all women aged 40 to 49 to have routine mammograms.\n\nWhen considering its recommendation, the task force took all available evidence into account, including published studies, Moyer noted. \"The data from randomized trials and modeling show there is a very modest improvement in mortality with mammograms from 40 to 49,\" she said.\n\n\"Because it is so modest and there are risks, people need to make their own decision,\" Moyer said.\n\nTo learn more about mammograms, go to the U.S. National Cancer Institute.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The article did interview the chair of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The most common treatment for urinary incontinence is a daily dose of an anticholinergic medicine that alters the action of certain nerves.

At a week old, doctors amputated his dead forearm and hand. They were afraid his body would be become infected and he would die. Falardeau mourned her boy's missing arm for years but, in time, embraced her son as he was.\n\nWyatt also learned to adapt. They tried a couple of prosthetics when he was younger and each time the toddler abandoned the false limb within months.\n\n\"His main interest was to create a shocking response from onlookers by pulling it off in the grocery store,\" Falardeau wrote on CNN iReport . In truth, she had been more concerned about getting him therapy for his autism-related delays -- the limb difference was secondary.\n\nSo when a friend shared a story from the \"Today Show\" with Wyatt in mind, about a team of University of Central Florida (UCF) students and graduates that made an electronic arm for 6-year-old Pring using a three-dimensional printer on campus, Falardeau was defensive.\n\n\"He doesn't need this,\" she thought.\n\nHer fifth-grader had a different reaction: \"I want one of these robot arms!\" Falardeau remembers Wyatt telling her and her husband. \"I could ride a bike! I might even be able to paddle a kayak!\"\n\nThere were other things the 12-year-old boy said he would do if he had two hands. A proper somersault. Clap with two hands.

The organization creates and shares bionic arm designs for free download at EnablingTheFuture.org that can be assembled for as little as $20 to $50. Middle and high school student groups and Girl and Boy Scout troops are among those donating their time and materials to assemble limbs for kids and give them to recipients for free.\n\n\"It's really just a step-by-step process of solving problems. The first problem we solved was: how do we make the hand move electronically? And then: how do we attach this arm to a child?\" said sophomore Tyler Petresky. \"It's just one problem after another we keep solving. That's what engineering is all about.\"\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about 1,500 babies in the United States are born with upper limb deformities each year. Comprehensive statistics aren't available for the number of children with amputations, such as Wyatt.\n\nThe UCF project started when Albert Manero, an engineering doctoral student, heard a story on the radio about one of the inventors of the 3-D printed hand. He got involved with E-Nable and met Alex, a local boy teased because of his missing arm, and set about designing a robotic replacement. They gave it to Alex for free.\n\nEach electronic limb takes about 30 to 50 hours to make and assemble. The students use the printer in the school's manufacturing lab and cover the cost of materials -- about $350 -- through donations.\n\nPetresky got involved with the design of Pring's hand because Manero knew he was good with electronics.\n\n\"He bribed me with some pulled pork sandwiches. I went over to his house and helped him out with electronics,\" he said. \"I found out he was working on an arm, and I thought that was the coolest thing in the world.\"\n\nEventually Manero moved to Germany for a Fulbright scholarship and left Petresky in charge of running the operations in Orlando.\n\nPetresky says they ask every family about the child's favorite color, superhero and interests, so the new limb can \"not just be a piece of plastic ... but be a part of them.\"\n\nAs they've designed the bionics, they've learned that kids don't necessarily want to blend in. Children have requested colorful designs inspired by superheroes, Disney's \"Frozen,\" and in Wyatt's case, the blue-skinned men from \"Blue Man Group.\" For Christmas, the group upgraded Alex's plain vanilla white arm to a new one resembling Optimus Prime from \"Transformers.\"\n\n\"We quickly found out this is much less about fitting in and feeling normal, and much more about expressing yourself,\" Petresky said. \"There's a large aspect of being artistic and being creative.\"\n\nThe team has made electronic arms for five children and are working with three more kids including Wyatt. He traveled with his mom to UCF last week and practiced flexing his muscle to make the hand open and close.\n\nHe expects to get fitted with his new arm later this month.\n\nHis mom, Cynthia, was most excited about seeing Wyatt being celebrated for who he is.\n\n\"The adoration of college students was an affirmation that money can't buy.

Furthermore, restarting therapy with the new oral anticoagulant dabigatran was associated with a lower risk of recurrent hemorrhage in these cases than the old standby drug warfarin.\n\nPeople take anticoagulants to avoid blood clots when they have a risk for stroke or heart attack, but the downside is that these medications increase a person's risk of severe bleeding--such as in the brain or gut--because the blood isn't clotting as well as it otherwise might.\n\n\"If a patient who is on an anticoagulant to avoid a stroke has a major bleeding event, doctors are faced with a catch-22: Discontinue the anticoagulant to avoid future bleeding, but again place their patient at increased risk of stroke; or resume the anticoagulant to continue avoiding a stroke, but then have to worry about another bleeding event,\" said lead author Inmaculada Hernandez, Pharm.D., Ph.D., an assistant professor in Pitt's School of Pharmacy, who completed this work as a doctoral student at Pitt's Graduate School of Public Health.\n\n\"It causes a lot of uncertainty for physicians, especially because patients at highest risk of recurrent bleeding also are at highest risk of stroke,\" said co-author Yuting Zhang, Ph.D., associate professor of health policy and management at Pitt Public Health, and Hernandez's doctoral dissertation committee chair.\n\nThe Pitt research team obtained data from 2010 to 2012 for a random sample of Medicare beneficiaries. They then followed nearly 90,000 people who had filled prescriptions for the anticoagulants warfarin, which has been used as a medication since 1954, and dabigatran, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2010. More than 1,500 of those people suffered a major bleeding event while using one of the drugs. About half of those people resumed one of the two anticoagulants a few months after the bleeding, while the others did not.\n\nThe risk of dying from any cause or having a stroke was 23 to 34 percent higher in patients who discontinued anticoagulation therapy compared to those who resumed it. People who took dabigatran after their initial bleeding event had nearly half the risk of another major bleeding event within one year compared with those who took warfarin.\n\n\"Our results should encourage clinicians to seriously consider resuming anticoagulation among patients who survived a major bleeding event, particularly if the source of bleeding was identified and addressed,\" said senior author Samir Saba, M.D., associate professor of medicine and associate chief of cardiology at UPMC Heart and Vascular Institute. \"They should also take into account that the benefit-to-risk ratio of post-hemorrhage use of anticoagulation is not the same for all medications.\"\n\nAdditional authors on this research are Maria M.

Common symptoms in the aftermath of concussion include confusion, headache, changes in vision or hearing, thinking or memory problems, fatigue, sleep changes and mood changes. Previously there has not been a way to predict whose symptoms will fade or persist following mTBI.\n\nAlthough effective drug treatments for mTBI await discovery, rest and counseling are known to be helpful for patients, Mukherjee said.\n\nIn the new study, the researchers focused on well-known networks of activity that are observed when the brain is in a resting state. \"We asked subjects to close their eyes, to relax, and to not focus their attention on anything specific -- but also to not fall asleep,\" Mukherjee said.\n\nIn comparison to the control subjects, who had never experienced TBI, mTBI patients displayed less connectivity in frontal areas of the \"default mode network,\" a set of brain regions that are particularly active in the resting brain. They also exhibited less connectivity within several other networks, including those known as the executive control network, the fronto-parietal network, the dorsal attentional network, and the orbitofrontal network; they showed an increase in connectivity in the visual network.

Results appear online Jan. 22, 2018, in Advances in Dental Research.\n\n\"We put the 2012 UCSF clinical study into the real world and showed it works,\" said lead author Peter Rechmann, DMD, PhD, professor of preventive and restorative dental sciences in the UCSF School of Dentistry. \"The patients at high caries risk who used prescription products went down significantly over time in their risk level. Those in the control group also reduced their risk to a lesser degree, simply by using over-the-counter products that also protect teeth and affect the bacteria.\"\n\nDental caries (tooth decay) is caused by bacteria on the tooth surface feeding on carbohydrates, then making acids as waste. These acids destroy the protective tooth enamel and the dentin layer beneath it. If not halted or reversed, this leads to a cavity.\n\nCAries Management By Risk Assessment (CAMBRA?) is an evidence-based approach to preventing or treating dental caries at its earliest stages. It was launched in 2003 through the UCSF School of Dentistry by the paper's senior author, John Featherstone, PhD, MSc, former dean of the school and distinguished professor of preventive and restorative dental sciences.\n\nA dentist who uses CAMBRA obtains the patient's dental and medical history and conducts a clinical exam to assess caries early enough to reverse or halt progression and to determine caries risk factors. These factors include, among other things, acid-producing bacteria, frequent eating and drinking of fermentable carbohydrates (\"snacking\"), and abnormally low saliva flow and function.\n\nFrom this assessment, the dentist utilizes behavioral approaches and chemical treatments to optimize protective factors. The treatment plan typically incorporates remineralization through the use of fluoride and/or antibacterial therapies such as chlorhexidine and xylitol, minimally invasive restorative procedures to conserve tooth structure, and regular patient follow up.\n\nThe authors published their initial validation of CAMBRA for ages 6 through adult in 2006, followed by several additional years of data published in 2011, 2012, 2015 and 2016. Since then, more than half of the U.S. schools and colleges of dentistry have adopted CAMBRA in one form or another as part of their standard curriculum. The authors said now that this has been shown to be effective in a non-academic clinical setting, there also is potential for insurance companies to reimburse CAMBRA and other preventive therapies for adults, thereby lowering patient costs while increasing profits for dental practices.\n\nIn the Advances in Dental Research study, Rechmann and his colleagues recruited 20 dentists - 17 in private practice, three in community clinics - to participate in a two-year CAMBRA trial of 460 patients ages 12-65 years old, with 239 in a CAMBRA group and 221 in a control group.\n\nIn the CAMBRA group, high-risk patients received prescription fluoride toothpaste, chlorhexidine antibacterial rinse, xylitol mints and fluoride varnish. The control group received regular fluoride toothpaste, an assumed inactive mouth rinse, sorbitol candies and a non-fluoride varnish.\n\nFollow-up visits occurred at six, 12, 18 and 24 months, in which new caries lesions or changes in caries risk level were recorded. Overall, the researchers found that a significantly greater percentage of high-risk participants were classified at lower risk after receiving CAMBRA preventive therapies. Dental decay was low in both groups.\n\nAmong 242 patients (137 intervention, 105 control) initially identified as high risk for caries, only a quarter of the patients remained at high risk in the CAMBRA group at 24 months, while just over half (54 percent) of the control group did. Of the 192 low-risk participants (93 intervention, 99 control), most participants remained low risk, indicating that the assessment correctly identifies who is at risk for caries.\n\nThe researchers said the risk reduction among the control group may have been caused by the fluoride toothpaste enhancing tooth repair, as well as the mouth rinse enhancing saliva flow and having bactericidal effects. While not as significant as the CAMBRA group in this study, the risk level of these patients dropped more dramatically over time than for those in the 2012 UCSF CAMBRA study.\n\n\"It was surprising to see the benefits gained by the control group,\" Rechmann said. \"More research is needed to see if the products and treatment administered to this group function in the way we speculate, and if so, they might be made easily available to dental patients. Doing so can change the whole picture of caries control.\"\n\nAmong the study limitations, the researchers noted a high study attrition (65 percent), which partly may have contributed to observed declines in risk level at each subsequent recall visit.\n\nCo-authors on the paper were Benjamin Chafee, DDS, MPH, PhD, assistant professor of preventive and restorative dental sciences and director of the Global Oral Health program, and Beate Rechmann, research associate, both from the UCSF School of Dentistry.

Age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, is the leading cause of vision loss among seniors, gradually eroding crucial central vision. There are different forms but more than 5 million people worldwide, and a million in the U.S., have an advanced type of so-called \u201cdry\u201d macular degeneration that has no treatment. First patients may notice blurriness when they look straight ahead. Eventually many develop blank spots, becoming legally blind.\n\n\u201cThese are seniors who are entering their golden years and now they\u2019ve lost the ability to read, watch television, see their loved ones,\u201d said Dr. Rahul Khurana, a retina specialist and spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. The experimental drug, lampalizumab, aims to slow the destruction of light-sensing cells in the retina, creeping lesions that characterize the stage of dry AMD called \u201cgeographic atrophy.\u201d When those cells die, they can\u2019t grow back \u2014 the vision loss is irreversible.\n\nIn an 18-month study of 129 patients, monthly eye injections of the drug modestly slowed worsening of the disease when compared with patients given dummy shots. What\u2019s exciting for scientists came next, when researchers from drugmaker Genentech Inc. took a closer look at exactly who was being helped. It turns out that nearly 6 in 10 of the study\u2019s participants carry a gene variation that makes part of the immune system go awry \u2014 a genetic flaw already known to increase the risk of getting macular degeneration in the first place. Those are the only patients who appeared to benefit from the drug; they had 44 per cent less eye damage than the untreated patients, the Genentech team reported Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine. While the study is too small to prove if lampalizumab really helps maintain vision, that\u2019s a bigger difference than the overall results suggested. Why would an immune-related gene affect aging eyes? One arm of the immune system, the complement pathway, helps fight infections by attracting immune cells to attack bacteria.\n\nNormally, there\u2019s a barrier that keeps such cells away from the retina. But that barrier can break down with age, opening sensitive eye cells to harm from the spillover, explained Genentech immunologist Menno van Lookeren Campagne. Now for the gene connection: Previous studies have linked macular degeneration to gene variations that remove some of that pathway\u2019s natural brakes, so it can become too active.\n\nThe hypothesis: Genentech\u2019s drug, lampalizumab, essentially offers a backup method for tamping down the immune reaction. An antibody, it works by inhibiting a particular enzyme named factor D that helps power the immune pathway. \u201cWe try to reinsert the braking ability,\u201d said study lead author Brian Yaspan, a Genentech senior scientist. Wednesday\u2019s study detected no safety concerns, clearing the way for Genentech and its parent company Roche to open two large-scale studies that aim to prove if the drug works. Results are expected later this year. The current research sheds light on how that long-suspected immune culprit might be working, and is \u201cthe first suggestion that there may be a treatment for geographic atrophy coming up in the future,\u201d said National Eye Institute retina specialist Dr. Wai Wong, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very exciting study,\u201d said Khurana, the ophthalmologist association\u2019s spokesman, who also wasn\u2019t part of the research. \u201cFrom the basic science perspective, it makes a lot of sense.\u201d Macular degeneration tends to occur after age 60, but it sometimes strikes earlier. According to the National Eye Institute, it\u2019s less common in people who exercise regularly, avoid smoking, and eat a diet high in green leafy vegetables and fish. Symptoms often aren\u2019t noticeable early on. But several eye tests can detect signs of macular degeneration, including a dilated eye exam and a tool called an Amsler grid with straight lines that may look wavy if the macula, the centre of the retina, is harmed. Macular degeneration patients often are advised to take certain vitamin combinations that may help stave off advanced disease. And it\u2019s important for patients to know what type they have. While there\u2019s no treatment for the advanced dry form, the \u201cwet\u201d form occurs when leaky blood vessels grow under the retina \u2014 and there are several therapies that can help those patients preserve vision.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Although there are independent sources in the story, we\u2019re not told that one of them\u2013Dr. Rahul N.

They drank roughly four cups of fluid per day, including just 2 cups of water a day.\n\nHalf of the women in the study were asked to consume 1.5 liters of water, or about 6 cups, each day in addition to their usual daily fluid intake. Specifically, they were asked to begin drinking a 1/2-liter water bottle at each meal and finish each bottle before the next meal.\n\nThe remaining women served as a control group. They continued their usual fluid intake.\n\nThe women were followed for a year, with clinic visits at the beginning of the study as well as 6 and 12 months later. Researchers measured their water and fluid intake; urine volume, frequency and concentration; and symptoms. They also called the women each month to assess compliance and counsel them to return to the clinic for evaluation and possible treatment if they were experiencing UTI symptoms.\n\nOverall, the water group increased daily water intake by close to 5 cups a day. Their total daily fluid intake, including water and other beverages, averaged nearly 12 cups.\n\nBy contrast, the control group's total daily fluid intake was less than half of that.\n\nHooton noted that it's not clear exactly how much fluid intake must increase to deliver a benefit.\n\n\"There's no magic in a liter-and-a-half,\" he said.\n\nLikewise, he believes any increase in fluid -- not just water -- may be beneficial since fluids are mostly water.

There could be fewer fillings in your future. A painless way to prevent cavities in adults is gaining traction.\n\n\"OK, Alice, we are going to put the fluoride varnish on your teeth,\" says Marion Manski, director of the dental hygiene program at the University of Maryland School of Dentistry. Fluoride varnish is standard practice for children's teeth, but Manski's patient, Alice Clash, is 91 years old. Like many older patients, Clash is taking medications that cause dry mouth, which puts her at high risk for cavities.\n\nSo Manski takes a skinny brush and a little pot of yellowish liquid and paints the varnish on Clash's teeth. \"We know that saliva helps us wash away bacteria and food in the mouth,\" Manski says. \"The fluoride varnish will help that.\"\n\nOne way fluoride helps is by seeping into the enamel and drawing the calcium and phosphate that's naturally present in the saliva. The minerals boost the teeth's natural healing process and make them more resistant to future decay. But there are other theories about how fluoride works. It strengthens the enamel before the tooth erupts, which is why it's so important for children. And it attacks the acid-producing bacteria in the mouth. One study shows fluoride makes it more difficult for these bacteria to stick to the teeth.\n\nIt takes about a minute, and the fluoride treatment is done. Some patients are also given a prescription for a concentrated fluoride gel that can be used at night.\n\n\"These preventative approaches work on adults just as well as they do on children,\" says Norman Tinanoff, a professor of pediatric dentistry at the University of Maryland. He says part of what's making fluoride treatments popular for adults is a move to make dental care personal, with an individual treatment plan for each patient. To do that, you have to weigh a patient's risk of getting cavities.\n\nOne of the biggest proponents of this approach is John Featherstone, dean of the University of California, San Francisco School of Dentistry. Featherstone came up with a comprehensive way of measuring a person's risk for caries, or tooth decay. It includes testing the level of bacteria in the mouth, and looking at dietary habits, medical conditions, medications, saliva flow and history of tooth decay. When Featherstone put his patients on personal treatment plans, he found the strategy worked.\n\n\"It really proved that drilling and filling did not fix the disease,\" Featherstone says. \"Putting in a filling fixes that hole in the tooth, but it doesn't deal with the bacteria in the rest of the mouth.\" Most bacteria are friendly, but a couple of bad actors can cause cavities. These guys feed on sugars and expel acid that eats away at the enamel.\n\nTraditionally, dentists were taught that the only way to deal with decay was to drill it out. That's still important in some cases, Featherstone says, but without fixing the underlying problem of bad bacteria, patients just keep coming back for more fillings. Featherstone saw another way. \"It's a little bit like your car is starting to rust,\" he says. \"If you can stop the rust before the rust goes right through the body of the car, then you're in good shape.\"\n\nLike rust, tooth decay is a slow process. A full-on cavity is a hole that needs to be fixed. But if you catch decay early, Featherstone says, it can be reversed using fluoride treatments like varnish and concentrated toothpaste and gels.\n\n\"In the past we believed tooth decay was a rapidly progressive disease. But research shows it's slowly progressive,\" says Wendell Evans, associate professor of dentistry at the University of Sydney in Australia. He recently published a study that found using these techniques reduced the need for fillings in adults by 30 to 50 percent.\n\nStriking as these results seem, the concept isn't new. This shift to a preventive model of dentistry is decades in the making. \"Some of the stuff in our study has been known for 50 years,\" Evans says, referring to the use of fluoride treatments.\n\n\"Prevention has always been a part of the world of dentistry,\" says Richard Valachovic, president of the American Dental Education Association. \"What we're seeing is a generational shift,\" Valachovic says. As dentists have come to better understand the microbiology of the mouth, more effective preventive techniques have followed.\n\nBut cost has been an issue. Insurance companies routinely pay for fluoride treatments for children, but not so much for adults. The National Association of Dental Plans couldn't give a definitive answer about coverage, but calls to some individual carriers and dental offices suggest it depends entirely on the type of plan you have. Some higher-end plans cover two fluoride treatments per year, while cheaper plans tend not to cover any. If you pay out of pocket, a varnish treatment costs from $23 to $55, compared with a filling, which ranges from $86 to $606, according to the American Dental Association.\n\nCost could also be a factor for dentists. Featherstone and Wendell say some dentists may be reluctant to embrace the preventive methods because they worry they'll lose money if they they do fewer costly procedures.\n\nAt this point, Featherstone says, two-thirds of dental schools in the U.S. teach some kind of disease management model based on a thorough risk assessment. And he expects that at some point all dentists will follow a preventive protocol.\n\n\"It will happen,\" Featherstone says. \"It's just a matter of time.\"", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story quotes a number of sources discussing this trend in dentistry, instead of just relying on one dentist.\nBut the piece would be more balanced had it included at least one source pointing out that some of the techniques advocated in the story could be overkill or wasteful for many people who are at just average risk for tooth decay.

It measures the damage to the DNA of white blood cells when subjected to different intensities of ultraviolet (UV) light, revealing measurable differences in the cells' susceptibility to further damage in patients with cancer.\n\nThe damage forms a 'comet tail' of DNA pieces that are pulled towards the positive end of an electric field. The longer the comet tail, the more DNA damage is present, which correlates with the presence of cancer. In a 2014 proof of concept study, the Bradford researchers showed they could identify which samples were from patients with three different types of cancer - even those who had yet to be diagnosed - with 93 per cent success.\n\nHowever, in their two most recent clinical trials of the test involving over 700 blood samples from colorectal and prostate cancer patients (and further breast and lung cancer samples that were available), they were unable to distinguish those with cancer from healthy patients in 60 cases.\n\nTo determine whether scoring more cells on the slides would explain this 'challenging subgroup', lead researcher Professor Diana Anderson from the University of Bradford asked IMSTAR, to reanalyse the inconclusive slides.

The participants were randomly assigned to participate in either a health education class about heart-friendly diet and exercise, or to attend a transcendental meditation program. Transcendental meditation involves shutting out the outside world and focusing thoughts inward, or resting while remaining alert. All of the participants continued to receive their normal medical care as well, including appropriate medication.\n\nMORE: Medical Meditation: Say Om Before Surgery\n\nAfter roughly five years of follow-up, the researchers found a 48% reduction in the overall risk of heart attack, stroke, and death from any cause among members of the meditation group compared to those from the health education group.

On the surface, it\u2019s intuitively obvious that stress management can affect heart health for the better; anxiety and stress cause blood pressure to shoot up and leave us on edge, triggering spikes in heart-harming stress hormones like cortisol.\n\nBut many experts are skeptical of the alleged benefits of techniques such as transcendental meditation that claim to reduce stress by a substantial amount. In the past, these benefits have been hard to test scientifically, largely because study participants who volunteered for meditation programs may have been biased to see them succeed. Practitioners have also made strong and essentially unsubstantiated claims about the powers of meditation, leading heart experts and scientists to be especially skeptical.

Among other things, breast milk contains natural sources of prebiotics: small, indigestible fiber molecules that promote the growth of good bacteria in the baby's gut. Yet for many families, breastfeeding is difficult or impossible. Fortunately, modern infant formulas are getting closer to the real thing with the help of University of Illinois researchers.\n\nIn a recent study from the Piglet Nutrition and Cognition Lab at U of I, scientists worked with piglets to show prebiotics included in infant formula can enhance memory and exploratory behavior.\n\n\"When we provide prebiotics in formula, our results confirm that we can not only benefit gut health, which is known, but we can also influence brain development,\" says Ryan Dilger, associate professor in the Department of Animal Sciences, Division of Nutritional Sciences, and Neuroscience Program at U of I. \"We can actually change the way piglets learn and remember by influencing bacteria in the colon.\"\n\nPiglets are widely considered a more informative model for human infants than mice and rats; their digestive systems, behavioral responses, and brain development are remarkably similar to human infants. Therefore, researchers are increasingly turning to piglets to test hypotheses in pre-clinical trials related to human health, especially in the context of gut microbes and brain development.\n\n\"There hasn't been a lot of work looking at the gut-brain axis in humans, but a lot of rodent work is showing those connections. This is taking it to an animal model that is a lot closer to human infants and asking if that connection still exists and if we can tease out possible mechanisms,\" says Stephen Fleming, lead author of the study and a doctoral student in the Neuroscience Program at U of I.\n\nIn early 2016, Dilger and his colleagues worked with piglets to show that a combination of innovative formula components, including prebiotics, may play a role in brain development and behavior. In their new study, the team concentrated solely on the effects of prebiotics.\n\nStarting on the second day of life, piglets were given a cow's milk-based infant formula supplemented with polydextrose (PDX), a synthetic carbohydrate with prebiotic activity, and galactooligosaccharide (GOS), a naturally occurring prebiotic. When the piglets were 25 days old, Fleming took them through several learning, memory, and stress tests. After 33 days, blood, brain, and intestinal tissues were collected for analysis.\n\nThe test for learning and memory gave piglets a chance to play with dog toys: one they'd seen before and one brand-new toy. If they spent more time with the new toy, that was an indication that the piglet recognized it as new and preferred it. This \"novel object recognition\" test improves on classic maze tests commonly used in rodent studies.\n\n\"If you're trying to test for memory, this test is closer to what we'd do with an infant. After all, we don't generally train infants on mazes,\" Fleming says. \"We know from previous research this test works for pigs, but this is the first published example of using it in a nutrition context.\"\n\nPigs fed PDX and GOS spent more time playing with new objects than pigs who didn't receive the prebiotic supplements. The preference for novel objects, an indication of natural curiosity, is a sign of healthy brain development and points towards positive development of learning and memory.\n\nWhen prebiotics are working the way they should, good bacteria increase in abundance. One way to tell is by looking at metabolic end-products - volatile fatty acids (VFAs) - excreted by bacteria during digestion of prebiotic fibers.\n\n\"Volatile fatty acids are a global indicator for whether prebiotics had an effect on the overall population of bacteria. For example, we might want to see an increase in Lactobacillus and other beneficial bacteria that produce butyrate,\" Dilger explains. Volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations in the colon, blood, and brain were changed in pigs receiving PDX and GOS compared with control pigs.\n\nRecent evidence suggests that bacterial VFAs could be getting into the blood and traveling to the brain, where they could potentially affect mood and behavior.\n\n\"We found that, yes, VFAs are absorbed in the blood of pigs that were fed PDX/GOS. And, yes, they do get into the brain,\" Fleming explains. \"But when we looked at the relationship between these VFAs and the results of our behavior tests, there did not appear to be a clear connection.\"\n\nAnother surprise was a decrease in serotonin in brains of pigs fed the prebiotic. \"When you hear less serotonin, there's an immediate reaction to say, 'Well, that's bad,'\" Fleming says. Not necessarily; those pigs didn't show greater anxiety than control pigs during a stress test or poorer performance when given a learning and memory test. The researchers hypothesize that the prebiotics may alter levels of tryptophan, serotonin's amino acid precursor, but it's too early to say.\n\nAlthough more work is needed to tackle remaining questions, the study adds to the growing body of research suggesting a strong and potentially modifiable link between the gut and the brain: a link that makers of infant formula should strongly consider.\n\n\"There are so many ways we can alter the composition of the microbiota and they can have very strong benefits. Promoting good 'gut health' remains a strong focus in the field of nutrition,\" Dilger says.\n\nThe article, \"Dietary polydextrose and galactooligosaccharide increase exploratory behavior, improve recognition memory, and alter neurochemistry in the young pig,\" is published in Nutritional Neuroscience.

Prediabetics are at increased risk for developing diabetes, which can damage the eyes, kidneys, nerves and blood vessels and often leads to cardiovascular disease.\n\nMany people with prediabetes also have untreated sleep apnea, although few of them are aware of it. The most widely accepted treatment for sleep apnea is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a device that blows a constant pressure of air into the lungs through a tube and face mask during the night. This helps people breathe better while they sleep by keeping the upper airway open.\n\n\"Our study showed that CPAP in patients with prediabetes can lower their risk of progressing to diabetes when CPAP is used for eight hours, a full night's sleep,\" said the study's lead author, Sushmita Pamidi, MD, a former fellow at the University of Chicago who is now on the faculty at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.\n\n\"Although eight hours of CPAP per night can be difficult to achieve in real-life, our results should provide a strong incentive for anyone with sleep apnea, especially prediabetic individuals, to improve adherence to their treatment for cardio-metabolic risk reduction,\" she said.\n\nPeople with sleep apnea, which is common among overweight and obese individuals, have repeated episodes where their upper airway closes during sleep. This can disrupt sleep and temporarily lower oxygen levels. It has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension and stroke, and may decrease their ability to regulate blood sugar levels. This increases the risk of diabetes.\n\nFor this study, the researchers recruited 39 middle-aged, overweight or obese volunteers with prediabetes and sleep apnea. Two-thirds of them (26) were randomly assigned to two weeks of CPAP treatment. The other 13 received a placebo -- a pill containing no medicine -- to be taken 30 minutes before bedtime. They were told the study would compare the two treatments.\n\nAll participants slept in the sleep laboratory and were closely monitored with all-night sleep recordings during the treatment period. Those assigned to CPAP wore the device for eight hours a night under continuous supervision by a technician. Before and after each treatment period, participants' glucose metabolism was assessed by oral and intravenous glucose-tolerance tests.\n\nThe researchers also measured the stress hormone noradrenaline in the blood and continuously monitored blood pressure for 24 hours at home. All participants were permitted to leave the laboratory during the day and engage in their routine activities.\n\nAfter two weeks, blood sugar control, as measured by an oral glucose tolerance test, improved for those in the CPAP group compared to the oral placebo group. In addition, the ability of insulin to regulate their blood sugar, estimated by the intravenous glucose tolerance test, was improved in the CPAP group compared to the oral placebo group. The CPAP group had, on average, 27 percent lower levels of the stress hormone, norepinephrine, as well as lower blood pressure than the oral placebo group.\n\n\"Despite the demonstrated efficacy of lifestyle interventions and the availability of many drug treatments, the economic and public health burden of diabetes remains enormous,\" said Esra Tasali, MD, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago and senior author of the study. \"Assessment of sleep apnea should be considered in patients at high risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, since our study shows that treatment of sleep apnea can reduce these risks.\"\n\nThe National Institutes of Health, plus the Diabetes Research and Training Center and the Institute for Translational Medicine at the University of Chicago funded this study.

The problem is that all too often, no one knows what is normal.\n\n\u201cA patient comes in because he\u2019s in pain,\u201d said Dr. Nelda Wray, a senior research scientist at the Methodist Institute for Technology in Houston. \u201cWe see something in a scan, and we assume causation. But we have no idea of the prevalence of the abnormality in routine populations.\u201d\n\nNow, as more and more people have scans for everything from headaches to foot aches, more are left in a medical lurch, or with unnecessary or sometimes even harmful treatments, including surgery.\n\n\u201cEvery time we get a new technology that provides insights into structures we didn\u2019t encounter before, we end up saying, \u2018Oh, my God, look at all those abnormalities.\u2019 They might be dangerous,\u201d said Dr. David Felson, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Boston University Medical School. \u201cSome are, some aren\u2019t, but it ends up leading to a lot of care that\u2019s unnecessary.\u201d\n\nThat was what almost happened with Mrs. Weinstein, an active, athletic 64-year-old who lives in New London, N.H. And it was her great fortune to finally visit a surgeon who told her so. He told her bluntly that her pain was caused by arthritis, not the torn cartilage.\n\nNo one had told her that before, Mrs. Weinstein said, and looking back on her quest to get a scan and get the cartilage fixed, she shook her head in dismay. There\u2019s no surgical procedure short of a knee replacement that will help, and she\u2019s not ready for a knee replacement.\n\n\u201cI feel that I have come full circle,\u201d she said. \u201cI will cope on my own with this knee.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Mrs. Weinstein was also lucky because her problem was with her knee. It\u2019s one of only two body parts \u2014 the other is the back \u2014 where there are good data on abnormalities that turn up in people who feel just fine, indicating that the abnormalities may not be so abnormal after all.\n\nBut even the data on knees comes from just one study, and researchers say the problem is far from fixed. It is difficult to conduct scans on people who feel fine \u2014 most do not want to spend time in an M.R.I. machine, and CT scans require that people be exposed to radiation. But that leaves patients and doctors in an untenable situation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a concern, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Jarvik, a professor of radiology and neurosurgery at the University of Washington. \u201cWe are trying to fix things that shouldn\u2019t be fixed.\u201d\n\nAs a rheumatologist, Dr. Felson saw patient after patient with knee pain, many of whom had already had scans. And he was becoming concerned about their findings.\n\nOften, a scan would show that a person with arthritis had a torn meniscus, cartilage that stabilizes the knee. And often the result was surgery \u2014 orthopedic surgeons do more meniscus surgery than any other operation. But, Dr. Felson wondered, was the torn cartilage an injury causing pain or was the arthritis causing pain and the tear a consequence of arthritis?\n\nThat led Dr. Felson and his colleagues to do the first and so far the only large study of knees, asking what is normal. It involved M.R.I. scans on 991 people ages 50 to 90. Some had knee pain, others did not.\n\nOn Sept. 11, Dr. Felson and his colleagues published their results in The New England Journal of Medicine: meniscal tears were just as common in people with knee arthritis who did not complain of pain as they were in people with knee arthritis who did have pain. They tended to occur along with arthritis and were a part of the disease process itself. And so repairing the tears would not eliminate the pain.\n\n\u201cThe rule is, as you get older, you will get a meniscal tear,\u201d Dr. Felson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a function of aging and disease. If you are a 60-year-old guy, the chance that you have a meniscal tear is 40 percent.\u201d\n\nIt is a result that paralleled what spine researchers found over the past decade in what is perhaps the best evidence on what shows up on scans of healthy people. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to look at a spine, you need to know what that spine might look like in a normal patient,\u201d said Dr. Michael Modic, chairman of the Neurological Institute at the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nAfter Dr. Modic and others scanned hundreds of asymptomatic people, they learned abnormalities were common.\n\n\u201cSomewhere between 20 and 25 percent of people who climb into a scanner will have a herniated disk,\u201d Dr. Modic said. As many as 60 percent of healthy adults with no back pain, he said, have degenerative changes in their spines.\n\nThose findings made Dr. Modic ask: Why do a scan in the first place? There are some who may benefit from surgery, but does it make sense to routinely do scans for nearly everyone with back pain? After all, one-third of herniated disks disappear on their own in six weeks, and two-thirds in six months.\n\nAnd surgeons use symptoms and a physical examination to identify patients who would be helped by operations. What extra medical help does a scan provide? So Dr. Modic did another study, this time with 250 patients. All had M.R.I. scans when they first arrived complaining of back pain or shooting pains down their leg, which can be caused by a herniated disc pressing on a nerve in the spine. And all had scans again six weeks later. Sixty percent had herniated disks, the scans showed.\n\nDr. Modic gave the results to only half of the patients and their doctors \u2014 the others had no idea what the M.R.I.\u2019s revealed. Dr. Modic knew, though.\n\nIn 13 percent of the patients, the second scan showed that the herniated disk had become bigger or a new herniated disk had appeared. In 15 percent, the herniated disk had disappeared. But there was no relationship between the scan findings at six weeks and patients\u2019 symptoms. Some continued to complain of pain even though their herniated disk had disappeared; others said they felt better even though their herniation had grown bigger.\n\nThe question, though, was whether it helped the patients and their doctors to know what the M.R.I.\u2019s had found. And the answer, Dr. Modic reported, is that it did not. The patients who knew recovered no faster than those who did not know. However, Dr. Modic said, there was one effect of being told \u2014 patients felt worse about themselves when they knew they had a bulging disk.\n\n\u201cIf I tell you that you have a degenerated disk, basically I\u2019m telling you you\u2019re ugly,\u201d Dr. Modic said.\n\nScans, he said, are presurgical tools, not screening tools. A scan can help a surgeon before he or she operates, but it does not help with a diagnosis.\n\n\u201cIf a patient has back or leg pain, they should be treated conservatively for at least eight weeks,\u201d Dr. Modic said, meaning that they take pain relievers and go about their normal lives. \u201cThen you should do imaging only if you are going to do surgery.\u201d\n\nThat message can be a hard sell, he acknowledged. \u201cA lot of people are driven by wanting to have imaging,\u201d Dr. Modic said. \u201cThey are miserable as hell, they can\u2019t work, they can\u2019t sit. We look at you and say, \u2018We think you have a herniated disk. We say the natural history is that you will get better. You should go through six to eight weeks of conservative management.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAt the Partners Healthcare System in Boston, spine experts have the same struggle to convince patients that an M.R.I. scan is not necessarily desirable, said Dr. Scott Gazelle, director of radiology there.\n\n\u201cThe consensus is that you are a surgical candidate or not based on your history and physical findings, not on imaging findings,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Gazelle had a chance last year to test his own convictions. He had the classic symptoms of a herniated disk \u2014 shooting pains down his left leg, a numb foot and difficulty walking.\n\nDr. Gazelle went to see his primary-care doctor but, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t get an M.R.I.\u201d That decision, he added, \u201cwas the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nAbout three months later, he had recovered on his own.\n\nIn 1998, two medical scientists, writing in The Lancet, proposed what sounded like a radical idea. Instead of simply providing patients and their doctors with the results of an X-ray or an M.R.I. scan, he said, radiologists should put the findings in context. For example, they wrote, if a scan showed advanced disk deterioration, the report should say, \u201cRoughly 40 percent of patients with this finding do not have back pain so the finding may be unrelated.\u201d\n\nIt is an idea that only would work for back pain, because that is the one area where radiologists have enough data. But it made eminent sense to Dr. Jarvik. \u201cIt gives referring physicians some sort of context,\u201d he said.\n\nSo, a few years ago, with some trepidation, his radiology group starting including epidemiological data in their reports. \u201cWe thought, \u2018What\u2019s going to be the reaction among referring physicians?\u2019 \u201d Dr. Jarvik said. Their fear was that doctors would start choosing other places for M.R.I.\u2019s and that Dr. Jarvik\u2019s group would lose business.\n\nBecause of the way the university\u2019s records are kept, it\u2019s hard to know whether the new reporting system had that effect, Dr. Jarvik said. But he was heartened by the responses of some doctors, like Dr. Sohail Mirza, who recently moved to Dartmouth Medical School.\n\n\u201cWe often see patients who have already had M.R.I. scans,\u201d Dr. Mirza said. \u201cThey are fixated on the abnormality and come to a surgeon to try to get the abnormality fixed. They\u2019ll come in with the report in hand.\u201d\n\nThe new sort of report, Dr. Mirza said, was \u201cvery helpful information to have when talking to patients and very helpful for patients to help them understand that the abnormalities were not catastrophic findings.\u201d\n\nOthers, like Dr. Modic, are hesitant about reporting epidemiology along with a patient\u2019s scan findings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting idea,\u201d he said. But, he added: \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t what happens after they get their imaging. It\u2019s that they get the imaging in the first place.\u201d\n\nThat was what happened with Mrs. Weinstein.\n\nWhen she started looking up her symptoms on the Internet, she decided she probably had a meniscus tear. \u201cI was very forceful in asking for an M.R.I.,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd when the scan showed that her meniscus was torn, she went to a surgeon expecting an operation.\n\nHe X-rayed her knee and told her she had arthritis. Then, Mrs. Weinstein said, the surgeon looked at her and said, \u201cLet me get this straight. Are you here for a knee replacement?\u201d\n\nShe said no, of course not. She skis, she does aerobics, she was nowhere near ready for something so drastic.\n\nThen the surgeon told her that there was no point in repairing her meniscus because that was not her problem. And if he repaired the cartilage, her arthritic bones would just grind it down again.\n\nFor now, Mrs. Weinstein says she is finished with her medical odyssey.\n\n\u201cI continue to live with this, whatever they call it, this arthritic knee,\u201d she said.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story quotes multiple experts.

That\u2019s what the findings of two new studies published this week suggest.\n\nIn the first study, published Monday in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention, scientists found that men who took a daily dose of acetaminophen (Tylenol) for five years had a 38% lower risk of developing prostate cancer, compared with other men. Additionally, daily acetaminophen was associated with a 51% reduced risk of developing an aggressive form of the disease. Men who took acetaminophen for less than five years saw no protective benefit.\n\nPrevious research has shown that taking aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) every day may help reduce prostate cancer risk. The authors theorize that the same may be true of acetaminophen; while not an NSAID, it does have anti-inflammatory properties.\n\nFor the study, the researchers looked at data from 78,485 men who participated in the longitudinal Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort, answering questions about diet and drug use every two years starting in 1992. During the follow-up, there were 8,092 cases of prostate cancer \u2014 significantly fewer in the group who took acetaminophen daily for five years.\n\nThe second study, published online Tuesday by Cancer Research, involved 1,455 men who had already been diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer. Researchers from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and Harvard School of Public Health followed the men from 2004 to 2009 and found that those who engaged in regular brisk walking after diagnosis were significantly less likely to see their disease progress.\n\nMen who walked briskly \u2014 at a pace of about 3 miles per hour or faster \u2014 at least three hours per week were 57% less likely to experience disease progression (including elevated PSA levels, secondary treatment, bone metastasis or prostate cancer-related death), compared with men who walked less and more slowly.\n\n\u201cThe important point was the intensity of the activity,\u201d Erin Richman, a postdoctoral fellow at UCSF, said in a statement. \u201cThe walking had to be brisk for men to experience a benefit.\u201d\n\nThe researchers said the effect of brisk walking persisted independent of age, diagnosis, type of treatment and characteristics of disease. The patients\u2019 average age at diagnosis was 65. The findings are in line with previous research suggesting that physical activity may help reduce the risk of disease-related death in certain cases of prostate cancer.\n\nRichman and colleagues noted that the brisk walks may reduce insulin resistance, which decreases bioavailable insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) and increases adiponectin levels, which are all associated with decreased risk of advanced or fatal prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo. Another potential source of the associated reduction was reduced inflammation due to a lower circulation of interleukin-6, high levels of which \u201cpredicted a 73% increased risk of dying from prostate cancer among normal-weight men,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nProstate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men. According to the National Cancer Institute, about 32,050 men died from prostate cancer in 2010 and 217,000 new cases were diagnosed. More than 2.2 million men in the U.S. are living with prostate cancer.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "No independent expert source was cited to comment on either finding.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "It\u2019s common for people who suffer from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to also struggle with depression. Now, a small study published in the journal suggests that taking a probiotic supplement may provide relief from both conditions.\n\nThe randomized, placebo-controlled trial shows a connection between probiotics and mood improvement in people with IBS and depression or anxiety, as well as changes in brain regions related to emotional processing. Most previous research on this topic has been on healthy people without mood disorders.\n\nFor the new research, scientists from McMaster University in Canada recruited 44 adults with IBS as well as mild to moderate anxiety or depression. They were followed for 10 weeks; half took a daily dose of the probiotic , and half took a placebo. The probiotics were manufactured and provided by Nestle, which also funded the study. (Nestle was not involved in collection, analysis or interpretation of study data.)\n\nAfter six weeks, twice as many people who took the probiotic had decreased depression scores compared to those who took the placebo: 64% versus 32%. Results were similar after 10 weeks, as well. When people in the study were given functional MRI scans, the researchers found that improved depression scores were associated with changes in activity of several brain areas involved in mood regulation.\n\nThose changes in brain activity \u201csupport the notion that this probiotic has anti-depressive properties,\u201d the authors wrote in their paper. While their data did not show significant independent changes in anxiety, constipation, diarrhea or pain, people who took the probiotic did report improvements in overall symptoms of IBS and in quality of life.\n\nOne explanation for the improved mood in the group taking probiotics could be that because their physical symptoms feel better, their mood gets better too. That\u2019s why Dr. Roger McIntyre, professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the University of Toronto, thinks the fMRI findings are the most interesting and important aspect of the new study: they signal that the probiotics may really be working on the brain itself.\n\nMORE: You Asked: Should I Take Probiotics?\n\n\u201cWe know that one part of the brain, the amygdala, tends to be red hot in people with depression, and it seemed to cool down with this intervention,\u201d says McIntyre, who was not involved in the new research. \u201cIt provides more scientific believability that something in the brain, at a very biological level, seems to be affected by this probiotic.\u201d\n\nNo serious side effects related to the probiotic were reported, suggesting that such a supplement could be a safe way to treat both stomach- and mood-related symptoms. Studies have looked at various types of probiotics for IBS patients, the authors wrote, and a recent review found that seemed to work better for gastrointestinal symptoms than another common probiotic, .\n\nSome experts believe that gut bacteria influence the brain (and vice versa) mainly through systemic inflammation. But in this study, the researchers found no difference in inflammatory markers between the probiotic and the placebo group. McIntyre points out that the bowel communicates with the brain through other pathways as well, including the metabolic and nervous systems.\n\nThe study\u2019s findings need to be confirmed in larger independent trials, and McIntyre says he wouldn\u2019t yet recommend taking a probiotic for symptoms associated with mental disorders like depression or anxiety. (Study co-author Premysl Bercik, associate professor of medicine at McMaster University, says the formula used in the new research isn\u2019t commercially available, anyway.) \u201cThe evidence at this point is promising,\u201d says McIntyre, \u201cbut it is not sufficient to justify recommending to patients as a viable treatment strategy.\u201d\n\nBut McIntyre says the results are encouraging. \u201cThey seem credible to me, and they might hint that there are other mechanisms, besides just inflammation, linking the GI tract to the brain,\u201d he says.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "There is a discussion early\u00a0in the story that the research was funded by Nestle.

They were presented at an academy meeting and published in the journal Neurology.\n\nMedicines backed by the strongest evidence include anti-seizure drugs (divalproex sodium, sodium valproate and topiramate), blood pressure drugs (metoprolol, propranolol and timolol) and, for menstrual-related migraines, a medicine called frovatriptan, the guidelines say. They also cite strong support for the herbal remedy butterbur and include a longer list of prescription and non-prescription therapies patients can consider.\n\nThese preventive treatments usually are used daily. The guidelines do not look at the options patients have once symptoms begin.\n\nNot everyone with migraines needs prevention medicine. But nearly 40% have headaches that are so frequent (at least once a week), severe or hard-to-treat that they qualify, Silberstein says. Studies find that just 3% to 13% use the treatments.\n\nWhy so few? One reason is that it's hard to persuade people to take medicines on days when they feel fine, says Elizabeth Loder, a neurologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Silberstein adds that some patients have not been properly diagnosed or made aware of their options. Still others try the treatments and decide they don't work or have unacceptable side effects.\n\n\"You have a lot of gun-shy patients because of a lot of bad experiences,\" says Michael John Coleman, founder of the patient group MAGNUM, also known as the National Migraine Association.

She was given a prescription for Topamax (topiramate), and it \"was a real nightmare,\" she says.

But about 80% will get relief, he says \u2014 defined as a headache reduction of at least 50% \u2014 after trying three or four drugs, alternative remedies and lifestyle changes.\n\nEven hard-to-treat patients may eventually respond to something, Loder says, so she urges frustrated patients to keep trying.\n\n\"The life toll that poorly controlled headaches take is really underappreciated,\" she says. \"You don't get back the time you lost at work or the time you lost with your children.\"\n\nColeman, of Alexandria, Va., also urges fellow sufferers to keep working with their doctors: His own migraines took 40 years to control. \"This is not a cookie-cutter disease and there is no magic bullet, but there is hope.\"", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story included an independent expert source and had some valuable input from a patient advocate group.

Then earlier this year, she went from coping with blindness to hoping she might see again.\n\nCampbell is one of only 14 people in the United States participating in an FDA-approved study of an artificial retina -- a microchip implanted in the eye to stimulate damaged cells.\n\n\"Amazing,\" said Campbell with a smile. \"It's like 'Star Trek.' \"\n\nA microchip to help someone see may sound more like a \"Star Trek\" device than legitimate science, but it is real.\n\n\"This is really the first step toward a really bionic eye,\" said Aries Arditi, a senior fellow in vision science at Lighthouse International, a nonprofit advocacy group for the blind and one of the study sites for the artificial retina.\n\nA healthy retina sends electrical signals to the brain, telling it how to decipher light. A damaged retina cannot transmit those signals, so the artificial retina is outfitted with rows of tiny electrodes to do the job.\n\nIn July, Campbell underwent surgery to implant the microchip into her eye.\n\n\"When light goes into [Campbell's] eyes, she doesn't see anything, because it's not being projected by the cells of the retina,\" said Dr. Lucian Del Priore, an ophthalmologist at New York Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, who implanted Campbell's artificial retina.\n\n\"This is an artificial device that essentially stimulates the retina electrically,\" Del Priore said.\n\nHow to see a tree artificially\n\nSince her eyes cannot detect light or images on their own, Campbell wears a pair of sunglasses outfitted with a small camera. As she scans and focuses the camera on an object in her environment -- for example, a tree -- a wireless device transmits that image to the artificial retina inside her eye.\n\nThe electrodes on the microchip then stimulate cells on the retina roughly in the shape of the tree. The shape is communicated to the brain -- the idea being that Campbell might one day perceive some semblance of a shape of that tree.\n\n\"It's a rudimentary level of vision,\" said Brian Mech, vice president of business development at Second Sight Medical Products Inc., the developer and manufacturer of the artificial retina. \"But for people without vision, that can be pretty remarkable.\"\n\nIn 2002, the first-generation artificial retina had only 16 electrodes.\n\n\"Patients were able to do things that we would not have anticipated with so few electrodes,\" Mech said. \"One patient could shoot baskets, and another was crossing crosswalks.\"\n\nCampbell received one of the second-generation artificial retinas with 60 electrodes, and thus far, according to her doctors, has made significant progress.\n\nWhen she stands outside her apartment building, she can now sense light emanating from windows. Navigating up the stairs of her building, she now knows that there is light illuminating the hallways. And when she arrives home and makes tea, she can sense light coming from the burners on the stove.\n\nAnd just recently, during a vision test, Campbell was able to correctly identify a sequence of letters for the first time in decades.\n\n\"I was like, 'You're kidding,' \" Campbell said. \"I was shocked. I still can't believe it.\"\n\nCampbell's doctors try to temper her excitement and that of other study participants.\n\n\"Being able to repair, in some way, a function that has been lost is a very exciting thing,\" Del Priore said. \"But it is important to be realistic.\"\n\nRecognizing faces, driving or reading the small print in newspapers is a very long way off, Mech said. And while some patients like Campbell do well with the implant, there are some who struggle.\n\nStill, the feeling among those involved in the study is tempered excitement.\n\n\"We can now take someone who is totally blind and turn them into someone with very, very poor vision,\" said Arditi, who trains Campbell weekly on how to nurture her vision. \"That's really the first time in history we've been able to do that.\"\n\nDevices with 100 and 1,000 electrodes are in production, and the hope, Mech said, is that more electrodes will mean more-detailed vision.\n\nToday, the artificial retina is primarily for sufferers of retinitis pigmentosa, but it could expand to other diseases, like dry age-related macular degeneration, Mech said.\n\nThere are 100,000 people in the United States affected by retinitis pigmentosa, according to the National Eye Institute, a division of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nTraining Campbell's eye and brain to see again will take years of rehabilitation.

Larotrectinib is the first cancer drug to receive FDA breakthrough therapy designation for patients with a specific fusion of two genes in the cancer cell, no matter what cancer type. The research appears in The Lancet Oncology.\n\n\"In some cancers, a part of the TRK gene has become attached to another gene, which is called a fusion. When this occurs, it leads to the TRK gene being turned on when it's not supposed to be and that causes the cells to grow uncontrollably. What's unique about the drug is it is very selective; it only blocks TRK receptors,\" said lead author Dr. Ted Laetsch, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics and with the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nLarotrectinib, targets TRK fusions, which can occur in many types of cancer. While the TRK fusions occur in only a small percentage of common adult cancers, they occur frequently in some rare pediatric cancers, such as infantile fibrosarcoma, cellular congenital mesoblastic nephroma, and papillary thyroid cancer, said Dr. Laetsch, who leads the Experimental Therapeutics Program (ETP) in the Pauline Allen Gill Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders at Children's Health in Dallas.\n\n\"Every patient with a TRK fusion-positive solid tumor treated on this study had their tumor shrink. The nearly universal response rate seen with larotrectinib is unprecedented,\" Dr. Laetsch said.\n\nAmong them was 13-year-old Briana Ayala of El Paso, who aspires to a career in fashion design. In 2016, Briana was found to have a rare tumor in her abdomen wrapped around her aorta, the largest artery in the body.\n\nSurgeons in her hometown said it would be too dangerous to operate, so her family brought Briana to Children's Health in Dallas, where UT Southwestern Professor of Surgery Dr. Stephen Megison had to remove portions of her aorta while removing most of the tumor.\n\nBut the cancer started to grow again and no further treatments were available.\n\nDr. Laetsch sent her tumor for genetic testing and found that Briana's cancer had the TRK fusion, meaning the new drug might help.\n\nBriana enrolled in the phase 1 clinical trial of larotrectinib and began taking the drug twice a day. Within weeks her pain and the swelling in her abdomen diminished, and scans showed her tumors had shrunk significantly.\n\nNearly two years later, Briana is back in school and playing with her dog, Goofy, and the family's seven parakeets. She's also been able to pick up her sketch pad and her dreams of a New York City fashion career.\n\n\"These are the kind of amazing responses we've seen with larotrectinib,\" said Dr. Laetsch, \"and this is why I'm so excited about it.\"\n\nThe results of the larotrectinib trial in adult patients - a 75 percent response rate - were published last month in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThe TRK-fusion mutation can be present in many types of cancers, including lung, colon, thyroid, and breast cancer, as well as certain pediatric tumors. TRK, short for tropomyosin receptor kinase, is a gene that plays a key role in brain and nervous system development and has a limited role in nervous system functions such as regulating pain in later life.\n\nLarotrectinib belongs to a class of molecules known as kinase inhibitors, which work by cutting back on the enzymatic activity of a key cellular reaction. The selectivity of the drug means it does not cause the severe side effects associated with many traditional cancer treatments, and none of the patients with TRK fusions had to quit the study because of a drug-induced side effect.\n\nEqually important, the response was long-lasting for most patients. \"For some of the targeted drugs in the past, many patients responded initially, but then resistance developed quickly. To date, the response to this drug seems to be durable in most patients,\" said Dr. Laetsch, who investigates the use of tumor molecular profiling to guide therapy in UT Southwestern's Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Division.\n\nA next step in the research is a clinical trial involving a similar drug for those patients who developed resistance. Dr. Laetsch will be the national leader for that clinical trial in children.\n\nThe larotrectinib research was supported by Loxo Oncology Inc., the National Institutes of Health, the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, and Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation.

This research shows that eating whole grains reduces the risk of heart disease,\" said John Kirwan, Ph.D., principal investigator and director of the Metabolic Translational Research Center, which is part of Cleveland Clinic's Endocrinology & Metabolism Institute.\n\nResearchers conducted a double-blind, randomized, controlled crossover trial. In the study, a group of 33 overweight and obese adults followed a whole grain diet (intervention) or a refined grain diet (control) for two eight-week periods. The diets were exactly the same, except for their content of whole grains or refined grains. At the beginning and end of each diet period, participants spent three days undergoing metabolic testing in a clinical research setting. Participants taking antihypertensive medication were instructed to maintain medication usage throughout the study.\n\nWhile on the whole grain diet, participants saw a three-fold improvement in diastolic blood pressure (the lowest pressure when your heart relaxes between beats) compared to the refined grain diet. This improvement equates to reducing the risk of death from heart disease by almost one-third, and the risk of death from a stroke by two-fifths.\n\n\"The uniqueness of this study is that each of the 33 participants consumed both diets,\" said Kirwan. \"This level of control can only be performed for small numbers and provides the essential empirical data that cannot be obtained from large observational studies. These evidence-based data demonstrate the effect of diet on cardiovascular disease outcomes, particularly diastolic blood pressure.\"\n\nBlood pressure is typically recorded as two numbers. Systolic is the top number that measures the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats. Diastolic is the bottom number, which measures the pressure in the arteries when the heart muscle is resting between heartbeats.\n\nHypertension - or high blood pressure - is a common obesity-related condition that affects about 30 percent of U.S. adults and it is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Before age 50, an elevated diastolic blood pressure is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. As they age, people with elevated diastolic blood pressure are at a higher-than-average risk of developing elevated systolic blood pressure.\n\nOverall, there were substantial reductions in body weight, fat loss, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol during both diet periods, but these differences were due to the people changing their normal dietary habits to carefully controlled diets.\n\nThis collaborative research began in 2010. It was supported by an investigator-initiated grant from Nestl\u00e9, NIH National Center for Research Resources Grant UL1RR024989, and NIH Grant T32 DK007319.

And, increasingly, it resonates for Westerners.\n\nMove over, pomegranate and acai berry. Coconuts are the new \u201cin\u201d food, touted by natural-foods enthusiasts and chased by entrepreneurs looking for a big payday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good time to own a coconut farm, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Daniel Fabricant, vice president for government and scientific affairs at the Natural Products Association, a trade association in Washington.\n\nFabricant said companies that belong to his organization, representing natural-foods retailers and manufacturers, are increasingly offering coconut-based products.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got fiber, fats and oils, water-based compounds, and you\u2019ve got the milk,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a holistic approach.\u201d\n\nThe fruit\u2019s appeal rests, in part, on this versatility. A single coconut produces water, nectar, flesh, milk and even textile fiber. That translates into a broad slate of products. And in contrast to another natural substance that gets transformed into a wide variety of products \u2014 petroleum \u2014 coconuts are viewed as healthy.\n\nBut are they?\n\nCoconut water comes from young, green coconuts and contains a winning combination of electrolytes, sodium and potassium.\n\nIt is very healthy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an effective drink for rehydration that doesn\u2019t bring in the added sugars and the additives,\u201d said Dani Little, dietitian for the Whole Foods Market on Pearl Street in Boulder. \u201cA lot of rehydrating beverages have additives, whereas the coconut water \u2014 it\u2019s super clean.\u201d\n\nCoconut oil and milk, though, are receiving mixed reviews.\n\nCoconut fat is saturated, like the fat in lard and butter. The healthiest fats, those found in olive and canola oils, contain more monounsaturated fats, which do not raise LDL cholesterol and might even help lower it. Doctors and dietitians have warned people away from cholesterol-boosting saturated fats for years. Coconut fats are not an exception.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had clients who have added coconut oil to shakes and things like that, and their cholesterol has gone up significantly,\u201d said Jessica Crandall, a Denver dietitian who is president of the Colorado Dietetic Association. \u201cSaturated fat clogs your arteries and is not good for heart health. I was meeting with a cardiologist recently, and he said he doesn\u2019t advise (coconut oil) for any clients.\u201d\n\nThe fat issue is complicated by the types of fatty acids found in coconut, versus other saturated fats. While most other saturated fats contain \u201clong- chain\u201d fatty acids, most coconut fats are \u201cmedium-chain.\u201d\n\nThis is advantageous for coconuts because the medium-chain fatty acids are broken down more rapidly by enzymes, said Little. In general, she said, fats high in medium-chain fatty acids are more healthy than those laden with long-chain acids.\n\nIn addition, coconut fats are high in lauric acid, which many believe acts as an antimicrobial, helping prevent viruses, fungi and parasites.\n\nEven so, Little, a coconut enthusiast, doesn\u2019t recommend loading up on coconut fats. Instead of buying oils or supplements, just use the whole coconut.\n\n\u201cWhat we tend to do with our food supply is take the positive and squeeze it into a pill or jar and think that will take care of everything,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you focus on coconut oil, you lose out on the fiber and you are focusing on a concentrated source of calories. It\u2019s the whole coconut that needs to be talked about.\u201d\n\nEntrepreneurs are talking about the whole coconut these days. Some \u2014 those toiling to make money with coconut water \u2014 are worried about the coconut supply.\n\nCoconut water \u201cis much different from Red Bull or Vitamin Water,\u201d said John Craven, the founder of Bevnet.com, a trade publication for the beverage industry. \u201cIf they want to make more, they just build more factories.\u201d\n\nCraven describes the race to turn coconut water into a big market, like iced tea or energy drinks, as something akin to a gold rush.\n\n\u201cRight now, coconut water is all the rage,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the natural movement being in the forefront right now, the timing is right. In the past couple of years a couple of brands have figured out the right angle \u2014 electrolytes and hydration.\u201d\n\nCraven estimated the coconut-water market at about $100 million annually right now, but companies are doubling their sales year after year. By next year, he said, one company alone \u2014 Vita Coco \u2014 could do $100 million or more in sales. He predicted within a few years it will be a billion-dollar market.\n\nMammoth beverage companies like Coca-Cola, Dr Pepper Snapple Group, and PepsiCo have investments in coconut water. Grocers shelves add new coconut-water products regularly.\n\n\u201cDemand has increased exponentially, primarily in mainstream groceries like Walmart and Costco,\u201d said Arthur Gallego, a spokesman for the New York-based Vita Coco. \u201cIt\u2019s trickling down to the mass market.\u201d\n\nThe company is growing so quickly, he said, it had to hunt for coconuts from outside of Brazil, where it previously harvested most of its fruit. Now it also gets coconuts from Asia.\n\n\u201cThe volume is going through the roof,\u201d said Laura Sauls, a spokeswoman for Hermosa Beach, Calif.-based Zico. \u201cWe are seeing new competitors by the week.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the pure water that is exciting marketers.

A tablespoon of butter, by comparison, contains 102 calories and 11.5 grams of fat; 7.3 of those grams are saturated.\n\nCoconut milk doesn\u2019t pack quite the wallop of oil, but consume it in moderation: a quarter-cup has 240 calories and 14.5 grams of fat, with 12.5 grams of the fat saturated.\n\nOne cup of coconut water contains 46 calories, a half-gram of fat , 252 milligrams of sodium and 8.9 grams of carbohydrates.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story quotes a lot of people.

Kelly Nichols, O.D., Ph.D., a dry eye expert and dean of the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Optometry, conducted research studies for the parent drug company to explore the efficacy and safety of lifitegrast in treating this eye condition that affects more than 16 million adults in the United States.\n\nInflammation associated with dry eye may eventually lead to damage to the surface of the eye.\n\n\u201cDry eye is a common complaint to eye care professionals, with millions of U.S. adults experiencing the symptoms of this often chronic disease,\u201d Nichols said. \u201cIt is critical for eye care professionals to have a dialogue with patients who report symptoms because dry eye can be a progressive ocular surface disease.\u201d\n\nThe twice-daily eye drop solution of 5 percent lifitegrast ophthalmic solution is the only prescription eye drop indicated for the treatment of both signs and symptoms of dry eye, and it is the first new dry eye prescription drop approved in the last 13 years.\n\nNichols and a team of researchers studied 1,181 patients, of whom 1,067 received lifitegrast in four placebo-controlled 12-week trials. Signs and symptoms were assessed at baseline and at weeks two, six and 12.\n\nIn all four studies, eye dryness was significantly reduced, with two of the studies showing improvements at week two. Results from inferior corneal staining tests \u2014 used by physicians to detect abrasions on the cornea \u2014 showed improvement in three of the four studies.\n\nNichols continues to push for funding and advancement for dry eye research and treatment. Prior to FDA approval of the lifitegrast eye drop, Nichols presented a congressional briefing in Washington, D.C., addressing research into dry eye for the National Alliance for Eye and Vision Research. She focused on the cause and potential therapies for dry eye that are being funded through the National Eye Institute and in private industry.\n\nFocusing her research on all aspects of the eye, Nichols discussed the mechanics of the three layers of the tear film and the importance of each from the cornea outward:\n\u2022 Mucin layer: helps tears adhere to the eye\n\u2022 Aqueous layer or water layer: nourishes and protects the cornea\n\u2022 Lipid or oil layer: lubricates and prevents evaporation and provides smooth refractive surface needed for optimal vision\n\n\u201cWe are unsure which of the 200-plus different lipids and 500-plus unique proteins are most important for protecting and lubricating the eye, and the absence or insufficiency of which results in dry eye,\u201d Nichols said.\n\nThere are more than 30-plus new dry eye basic, translational and clinical studies being funded by the NEI/National Institutes of Health to further explore these lipids and proteins, with more than 50 papers being published monthly.\n\n\u201cFunding from NIH is helping the optometry world make significant strides in understanding the cause and treatment of dry eye,\u201d Nichols said. \u201cWe still have a long way to go, but prevention and early detection are major goals.

Harte, PhD, a research scientist at Randox Laboratories. \"This type of testing is important in our quest to understand and diagnose Alzheimer's and empower patients to understand risks, consider medication, and even make early lifestyle changes.\"\n\nThis test detects the presence of a protein in the blood produced by a specific variation of the apolipoprotein gene (ApoE4), which is associated with increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The apolipoprotein gene is inherited from each parent and when a patient inherits the ApoE4 variant from one parent they have a three times greater risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, whereas a patient who inherits ApoE4 from both parents is eight-to-12 times more likely to develop the disease.\n\nTo verify the accuracy of the biochip test, 384 samples were analyzed and results compared to those from a standard molecular diagnostic test. Researchers from Randox Laboratories collaborated with research colleagues at the Medical University of Vienna and found that results from the two tests were in 100% agreement. As biochip tests allow clinicians and researchers to quickly run multiple tests on one sample of blood, this new test is also faster and more affordable than the standard DNA test, producing results in only three hours.

The findings appear in an upcoming issue of the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (CJASN).\n\nPatients with chronic kidney disease are advised to follow dietary recommendations that restrict individual nutrients such as phosphorus, potassium, protein, and sodium; however, empirical evidence suggests that these restrictions\u2014which can be difficult to abide by\u2014have limited effects on reducing patients\u2019 risk of premature death.\n\nEmerging evidence indicates that overall eating patterns may have greater effects on patients\u2019 health and longevity. To investigate, a tem led by Giovanni Strippoli, MD, PhD (University of Bari, in Italy and Diaverum, in Sweden), and Jaimon Kelly (Bond University, in Australia) analyzed the medical literature, finding 7 relevant studies that included a total of 15,285 participants.\n\nHealthy dietary patterns were generally higher in fruits, vegetables, fish, legumes, cereals, whole grains, and fiber, and they were lower in red meat, salt, and refined sugars. In 6 studies, healthy dietary patterns were consistently associated with a 20% to 30% lower rate of mortality, with 46 fewer deaths per 1000 people over 5 years.

Not so. Previous research has suggested that exercise can improve memory and reverse muscle loss in older adults, among other benefits. And a study out Monday finds that a regular program of physical activity reduces the time spent with mobility-limiting disability.\n\nResearchers took more than 1,600 sedentary people between 70 and 89 years old who had some functional limitations, but who could walk about a quarter of a mile in 15 minutes or less, unassisted by another person or a walker. (Canes were OK.)\n\nHalf of the participants got a health education program involving regular in-person sessions and some stretching exercises, while the other group was told to aim for 150 minutes of aerobic activity as well as strength, flexibility and balance training both at the study's facilities and at home. \"Walking was the cornerstone of the program,\" says Thomas Gill, a professor of geriatrics at the Yale School of Medicine and an author of the study, which appears in Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nThe study followed participants for about 2.7 years, and found that the physical activity program cut the amount of time that people spent with a \"major mobility disability\" \u2014 defined as being unable to walk a quarter mile \u2014 by 25 percent compared to the education program. Previous findings from the same study showed that the exercise program lowered the risk of becoming disabled in the first place; this one showed that it sped recovery from an episode of disability and lowered the risk of subsequent episodes.\n\n\"They've done a really nice job of showing the incredible power of physical activity,\" says Bradley Cardinal, a professor of kinesiology at Oregon State University who wasn't involved with the study. \"It's the secret ingredient to successful aging in terms of quality of life.\" An editorial accompanying the study, by the University of California, San Francisco's Patricia Katz and the University of South Carolina's Russell Pate, also noted that people who engage in physical activity have a lower risk for heart disease, diabetes, certain cancers, depression, cognitive impairment and functional decline.\n\nThe exercise program pretty closely followed the government's recommendations for all adults, including older ones: 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week, plus two strength sessions that hit all the major muscle groups.\n\nBut most Americans don't get that much exercise, and that becomes increasingly true as people age. According to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, just 28 percent of those 75 and up meet the recommendation for aerobic activity, and only 8 percent also did the suggested amount of strength training.\n\nCardinal says older adults need to realize that exercise can greatly improve their quality of life by maximizing function as long as possible. But he says that many believe that older age is for relaxing and that physical activity is somehow dangerous or unnatural. That belief \"is pervasive among older adults,\" he says, even though for many of them, meeting the minimum requirements \"is doable.\"\n\nSemantics can help. \"We try to frame this as more physical activity than exercise,\" says Gill. \"We talk with older folks and many say, 'I can't exercise, but maybe I can become more physically active.' \" Study participants were advised to \"start low and go slow,\" and some were even able to get rid of their canes after six months of exercise, which Gill says they found particularly rewarding.\n\nPhysicians can also help. \"Prescribing exercise may be just as important as prescribing medications \u2014 perhaps even more important in some cases,\" the editorial said. The authors called on medical schools to \"start preparing students to prescribe exercise as effectively as they prescribe statins, and for health systems to support physicians in addressing inactivity just as they provide support in addressing other health risks.\" (The American College of Sports Medicine has an \"Exercise is Medicine\" initiative to help physicians integrate exercise recommendations into their treatment plans.)\n\nThere are also some basic behavioral strategies for getting yourself to get moving, no matter your age, including giving yourself an incentive to change and engineering your environment to encourage the activity.\n\nKatherine Hobson is a freelance health and science writer based in Brooklyn, N.Y.

Researchers set out to determine if this phenomenon, called the \"Mozart Effect,\" played a role in the detection rates of precancerous polyps during colonoscopies.\n\nIn their small study, two doctors performed endoscopies either while listening to Mozart or with no music at all. Both doctors improved their detection rates of potentially dangerous adenomatous polyps when they listened to music compared with their pre-study (\"baseline\") rates, the investigators found. But while both doctors had better results compared to their baseline rates, one doctor did slightly better in procedures without music than with music during the study.\n\nDetection rates for the first doctor were about 67 percent while listening to music and 30 percent with no music. This was up from a baseline detection rate of 21 percent before the study began.\n\nHowever, the second doctor had an adenoma detection rate of nearly 37 percent with Mozart and 40 percent without the music, compared with a baseline detection rate of 27 percent.\n\n\"Both endoscopists had higher adenoma detection rates listening to music when compared with their baseline rates,\" lead researcher Dr. Catherine Noelle O'Shea, of the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, said in an American College of Gastroenterology news release.\n\nThe study authors suggested that the findings could help reduce the number of people affected by invasive colorectal cancer -- the third most common cancer diagnosed in men and women in the United States, according to background information in the news release. When spotted early, potentially dangerous polyps can be removed during colonoscopies, preventing the development of disease.\n\n\"Adenoma detection rate is linked to a reduction in colorectal cancer incidence, so it is an important quality indicator for colonoscopy,\" said O'Shea. \"Anything we can do to get those rates up has the potential to save lives. While this is a small study, the results highlight how thinking outside the box -- in this case using Mozart -- to improve adenoma detection rates can potentially prove valuable to physicians and patients.\"\n\nThe study was slated for presentation Monday at the American College of Gastroenterology's annual meeting in Washington, D.C.

For the most advanced patients, 50 percent survival was the norm, whether patients had surgery to totally remove the voice box or alternative treatment with chemotherapy and radiation to try to avoid surgery.\n\nBut the head and neck oncology team at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center came up with a different approach: Give patients a single dose of chemotherapy and see who responds to it. The responders can continue with combination chemotherapy and radiation. The non-responders can be referred immediately for surgery.\n\nAfter a decade of using this approach, researchers are reporting \"exceptional\" survival rates nearing 80 percent, even for the most advanced patients. The team published their outcomes in JAMA Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery.\n\n\"In trying to match the biology of the tumor to the treatment, all of the patients get better outcomes,\" says study author Gregory T. Wolf, M.D., professor and chair emeritus of otolaryngology - head and neck surgery at Michigan Medicine.\n\n\"This approach allows us to enhance quality of life for all of our patients. Many patients can spare their voice box by having chemotherapy and radiation. But that's only good if the treatment works. For patients who must go on to receive surgery, by selecting them up front, we can spare them the complications that may occur when the voice box is removed following multiple cycles of chemotherapy with radiation,\" adds study author Francis Worden, M.D., professor of hematology/oncology.\n\nThe Michigan Medicine team first tested the idea in 1995. They found that patients whose tumor shrunk by more than half after one round of chemotherapy were more likely to do well with chemotherapy and radiation and have an excellent chance of saving their voice box. If the tumor did not respond after that first dose, patients would likely fail on the chemotherapy and would do better going straight to surgery.\n\nIn a clinical trial, they saw disease-specific survival rates of 80 percent in patients with advanced disease. This was unheard of. And it wasn't just those who responded to the chemotherapy. The non-responders who were immediately referred for surgery had better outcomes too.\n\n\"We adopted the treatment approach and started offering it to all our laryngeal cancer patients,\" Wolf says. As part of a Specialized Program of Research Excellence, or SPORE, grant, the team was already maintaining long-term follow-up data on patients. Wolf suggested they look back and see if they were still maintaining such strong outcomes with this approach. The results surprised even him.\n\nOver 10 years, 153 stage 3 and 4 laryngeal cancer patients were treated at Michigan Medicine, with about half receiving the induction chemotherapy. The remainder elected to proceed straight to surgery or chemo-radiation without the induction dose.\n\nAverage disease specific survival at five years for the induction chemotherapy patients was 79 percent - equivalent to the results in patients with early stage disease, and significantly better than the 66 percent survival for patients who had chemo-radiation without the induction strategy.\n\n\"This adds ammunition to the idea that we need to pick individual therapies more carefully. Both chemo-radiation and surgery are difficult treatments with their share of challenging long-term effects. But if we tailor treatments to the individual biology of the tumor and characteristics of the patient, we'll get the best results,\" Wolf says.\n\nThe study did find lower functional preservation of the larynx in the induction chemotherapy group compared to those who elected chemoradiation. Two-thirds of the induction group achieved organ preservation, while more than three-quarters of the chemo-radiation patients did.\n\nWolf notes, however, that chemoradiation often severely damages the larynx, which may cause problems with eating or swallowing years later.\n\nThe induction approach can be done anywhere, but requires intense collaboration among surgeons, medical oncologists and radiation oncologists. All three must be involved to assess the patient and refer to the appropriate therapy.\n\nEven that single dose of chemotherapy can be debilitating and toxic for some patients. Wolf hopes future research will reveal a way to tailor treatment without the need for the induction chemotherapy.\n\nFunding: National Cancer Institute grants P50 CA097248 and P30 CA046592, and the Sinabaldo and Diane Tozzi Research Fund", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Funding sources are clearly noted in the release and there do not appear to be relevant conflicts of interest.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "MONDAY, Oct. 10, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental Alzheimer's disease drug, gantenerumab, may help lower levels of amyloid plaque in the brains of people with the disease, an early clinical trial indicates.\n\nThe new study, which appears online Oct. 10 in the Archives of Neurology, is among the first to show the effects of an anti-amyloid drug in humans with Alzheimer's disease, but experts caution that while promising, more research is needed before this drug can be deemed safe or effective.\n\nAnd, in what may turn out to be an equally important caveat, experts also say that it's by no means certain that reducing levels of amyloid plaque would stave off memory loss and the other mental declines associated with the disease because the role of the plaque in Alzheimer's isn't fully understood.\n\nAlzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia. Symptoms including serious memory loss, confusion and mood changes develop gradually and worsen with time. Recently, many strides have been made in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease earlier, but doctors have been stymied by a lack of effective treatments to stop or slow the course of the disease.\n\nIt's long been known that a protein fragment called beta-amyloid builds up in the spaces between nerve cells in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease. The new drug, gantenerumab, targets these amyloid proteins by priming the body's immune system to recognize them as invaders.\n\nOf 16 people with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease, those who received two to seven infusions of the experimental drug every four weeks showed marked reductions in the amount of plaque in their brains via imaging tests that were conducted several months after their treatments.\n\nBy contrast, amyloid load increased among people who were randomized to receive the placebo. The new drug was given at either 60 or 200 milligrams (mg) doses. The higher dose yielded greater reductions in amyloid levels, the study showed. People who were given the 60 mg doses saw a nearly 16 percent reduction in the amount of amyloid, and those given the 200 mg doses saw a 36 percent reduction. The new study was conducted and funded by the drug's manufacturer, F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd., in Basel, Switzerland.\n\nThe big question is whether or not reducing amyloid levels has any effect on the symptoms or progression of Alzheimer's disease, said Dr. Patrick Lyden, chief of neurology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. \"There is a growing concern that amyloid is a guilty bystander, but not the actual culprit in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease, and taking away the bystander may not help the patient,\" he said.\n\nThere are approximately one dozen therapies, including vaccines, for Alzheimer's disease that are currently in the pipeline, Lyden noted. \"They are all extremely exciting and promising in animals,\" he said. \"This is the first one to show a preliminary result in people, but we have a huge way to go to make sure it is safe and improves symptoms.\"\n\nMany in the Alzheimer's research community are awaiting these drugs with bated breath, but \"none are ready for prime time,\" he said.\n\nThe leading theory of Alzheimer's disease is that an imbalance in the production or clearance of the amyloid plaque in the brain initiates a cascade of events that lead to dementia, explained Dr. Neelum Aggarwal, an associate professor of neurological sciences at Rush Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.\n\n\"Accumulation of the plaques cause a variety of cellular responses: inflammation, neuronal death, and thus any potential treatment that can alter these processes would be beneficial,\" she said. The hope is that gantenerumab or other drugs like it will not only prevent amyloid from accumulating in the brain, but also slow down the cognitive impairment that occurs in people with Alzheimer's disease, she added.\n\nThat said, these experimental drugs carry the potential for serious side effects, including causing the immune system to go haywire. \"The main issue that remains for this type of drug development is managing the immune response,\" Aggarwal said. Other side effects include a potentially fatal fluid build-up in certain areas of the brain. \"This is problematic in that use of these treatments may carry a very high risk for neurologic complications, thus necessitating heightened monitoring, and diminishing its applicability as a treatment for a larger patient population such as the Alzheimer's disease population,\" she said.\n\nIf any of these drugs make it through the pipeline, it also needs to be determined who will get them, including whether the drugs will be given to prevent Alzheimer's in patients at high-risk of the disease or to treat it once it's started.\n\nThe need for a drug to delay the onset or slow progression of Alzheimer's disease can't be underestimated, Aggrawal said. In the United States alone, there are 5.4 million people with Alzheimer's disease, and the numbers are expected to increase to 13 million by 2050, when approximately three of every five people over the age of 85 will have Alzheimer's disease, she said.\n\nFor more information about Alzheimer's disease signs, symptoms and treatments, visit the Alzheimer's Association.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Independent experts perspectives were helpful.\u00a0 Funding by the drug\u2019s manufacturer was disclosed.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Chicago, IL (May 6, 2017) -- A new study finds that individuals struggling with obesity who are not candidates for weight-loss surgery can benefit substantially from non-surgical endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty, according to research presented at Digestive Disease Week\u00ae (DDW) 2017, the largest international gathering of physicians, researchers and academics in the fields of gastroenterology, hepatology, endoscopy and gastrointestinal surgery.\n\nPatients who underwent ESG -- a procedure performed through the mouth with an endoscope to \"accordion\" the stomach by suturing pleats to reduce its size -- achieved greater weight loss than laparoscopic banding, but less weight loss than laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery. Patients who received treatment endoscopically had shorter hospital stays and lower costs than those who had laparoscopic surgery.\n\n\"Obesity continues to be a problem in America and it is an epidemic rapidly spreading around the world,\" said Reem Z. Sharaiha, MD, MSc, assistant professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and attending physician at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, the study's lead author. \"Our research -- the first to compare these treatments -- demonstrates that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is safe and effective in helping patients lead healthier lives. It should be considered as another tool available to clinicians and patients in the fight against obesity.\"\n\nDr. Sharaiha followed 278 patients who underwent ESG (91 patients), laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (120 patients) or laparoscopic banding (67). During the one-year follow-up period, patients went to an academic bariatric center of excellence as part of their treatment.\n\nAt one-year follow-up, patients who chose laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery achieved the greatest percent total body weight loss at 29.28 percent, compared to 17.57 percent for endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty patients and 14.46 percent for laparoscopic banding patients. Researchers found that patients who received endoscopic treatment had lower complications (1 percent) than those who received surgical treatment (10 percent for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and 11 percent for laparoscopic banding).\n\nDr. Sharaiha noted that these findings do not suggest that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty will replace the two surgical treatments as weight-loss interventions. Instead, these results show that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is another possibility that patients and health-care providers should consider when discussing options.\n\nWhile endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is performed with an endoscopic device through the mouth, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy involves a small surgical incision in the belly to place a tube in the abdomen, allowing doctors to reduce the stomach's volume. With laparoscopic banding, doctors insert a tube through an incision in the belly to place a band around the stomach, restricting food intake.\n\nThe team also reported that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty patients customarily left the hospital on the same day of treatment, while laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy patients stayed for about three days and laparoscopic banding patients for a day and a half.\n\nWhen examining cost, researchers reported endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty resulted in the lowest-cost, with an average institutional procedure cost of $12,000, compared to $22,000 for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and $15,000 for laparoscopic banding.\n\n\"For years, patients seeking weight-loss interventions had limited options because they could not tolerate or did not want surgery, or it was not even an option for them,\" added Dr. Sharaiha. \"Our research shows that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty can be the treatment they've been looking for. It's less invasive than surgery and helps them reach their health goals.\"\n\nObesity is associated with heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some cancers, and researchers estimate that it is the second-leading cause of preventable death, after tobacco use. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that more than one in three U.S. adults is obese, having a body mass index of 30 or more. The CDC estimated the medical cost of obesity in the U.S. at approximately $147 billion in 2008. Globally, the World Health Organization estimates that more than 600 million people were obese in 2014.\n\nDr. Reem Z.

The same is true for 88 percent of CRT-D patients, they noted.\n\nFive years out, those figures dipped to 68 percent for ICD patients and 54 percent for CRT-D patients.\n\nAmong those outfitted with CRT devices alone, one-year survival was pegged at 82 percent, while five-year survival came in at 48 percent, the investigators found.\n\nThe poorer prognosis for CRT-only patients was attributed to their older average age (76 years), and the fact that they may be relatively sicker overall. Patients today tend to receive CRT devices with defibrillators.\n\nThe study team also found that patients whose implants were monitored remotely, on a continual basis, by a health facility network were about half as likely to die as patients who only had intermittent in-person assessments.\n\nRemote monitoring via telephone lines and online physician access is available for all ICD and CRT-D devices, the authors noted, and enrollment in such programs is typically free with a cardiologist's recommendation.\n\n\"It's highly likely the reason these patients did better is that they were receiving earlier diagnoses, and they were also empowered to take charge of their own health care more,\" Saxon said. \"I don't think there's any reason not to put a patient on it.\"\n\nDr. Eric N. Prystowsky, cardiologist and director of clinical electrophysiology at St. Vincent Medical Center in Indianapolis, said that the findings are \"good news,\" but cautioned against over-interpreting the data.\n\n\"These are very basic facts, concerning simply who lived and died,\" he noted. \"So we don't really know what it all means, and it's inappropriate to suggest that we could, based only on this compilation of data.\"\n\nBut, Prystowsky continued, \"this analysis does show two impressive things: one, that patients who are not super-selected for a trial do well with these devices from a mortality standpoint; and two, that patients who had home-monitoring had better outcomes.\"\n\nPrystowsky added, \"Now on the latter point, again, from this data we can't say exactly why that is. But at our facility we think it makes caring for a patient much easier. Physicians knowing things sooner will theoretically give a patient a better chance for quicker access to appropriate care.

The study shows that receiving little to no nutrition during the first week in intensive care makes children recover faster.\n\nCritically ill children in intensive care are unable to eat independently. The current standard of care for such children is based mostly on the assumption that they need to eat to regain their strength. Therefore, the method that is applied worldwide is to artificially feed these children during the first days of their stay in intensive care. This artificial nutrition is meant to strengthen their muscles, prevent complications, and speed up their recovery. The artificial nutrition is infused directly into the bloodstream.\n\nAn international team of researchers from University Hospitals Leuven (Belgium), Sophia Children's Hospital Rotterdam (The Netherlands), and Stollery Children's Hospital Edmonton (Canada) has now challenged the validity of this common practice.

The effect was present in everyone, regardless of the type of disease, the children's age, or the hospital in which they were staying.\" These findings provide strong evidence against current practice and can thus be expected to change paediatric intensive care worldwide.\n\nPrevious research by Professor Van den Berghe and her team (2011 and 2014) had already shown that early artificial feeding should be avoided to treat adults in intensive care.", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "There\u2019s no information in the release about funding or potential conflicts of interest.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Newswise \u2014 SEATTLE (March 24, 2017) \u2013 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration yesterday granted accelerated approval to the checkpoint inhibitor Bavencio (avelumab) for the treatment of patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), including those who have not received prior chemotherapy. Avelumab is the first FDA-approved treatment for metastatic MCC and the first disease that the drug has ever been approved to treat.\n\nA rare and aggressive form of skin cancer, MCC, is 35 times less common than melanoma, but on average, it is about three times more likely to be deadly. Until now, there were no systemic therapies approved by the Food and Drug Administration for this cancer, and no approved therapies once the cancer had spread.\n\nTom Judd, who lives near Portland, Oregon, knows what it is like to be diagnosed with a deadly cancer for which there is no approved drug. After being diagnosed with MCC in 2013, his cancer jumped from a small pimple on his nose throughout his body, growing until it interfered dangerously with organ function.\n\nBy early 2015, the disease had nearly killed him, despite surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Then he enrolled in a clinical trial and received his first of many infusions of the new immunotherapy drug \u2013 avelumab. Within six weeks of that first infusion, more than one-third of the cancer throughout his body was gone, and today, more than 90 percent of his tumor mass has disappeared.\n\nBecause of the data from this clinical trial, avelumab (brand name Bavencio) has become the first systemic therapy approved by the FDA for MCC, and the first treatment of any kind approved for metastatic MCC.\n\nDr. Paul Nghiem, affiliate investigator of the Clinical Research Division at Fred Hutch, and the George F. Odland Endowed Chair in Dermatology at the University of Washington School of Medicine, is a senior investigator on the clinical trial that led to the FDA approval and the senior author on the Lancet Oncology article that preceded the approval.

The researchers tested for levels of a blood marker of vitamin B12 and for levels of homocysteine, an amino acid that has been linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (as well as heart disease and stroke).\n\nB vitamins, including B12 and folate, have been shown to help lower homocysteine levels, so high levels of the amino acid suggest low levels of B12.\n\nHealth.com: 9 foods that may help save your memory\n\nOver the next seven years, 17 study participants were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. The people with the highest levels of homocysteine at the beginning of the study had the greatest risk of developing the disease. In contrast, each unit increase in the marker of vitamin B12 (known as holotranscobalamin) reduced the risk of developing Alzheimer's by 2 percent.\n\nThe relationship between vitamin B12 and Alzheimer's risk is \"complex,\" says Dr. Sudha Seshadri, M.D., an associate professor of neurology at the Boston University School of Medicine and the author of an editorial accompanying the study. But, she adds, \"B12 levels, particularly holotranscobalamin levels, likely play a contributory role.\"\n\nThe links among Alzheimer's risk, homocysteine, and B12 were more pronounced in older individuals, the study found.\n\nBlood levels of folate, which the researchers also measured, were not related to homocysteine levels or Alzheimer's risk in this study. Folic acid -- a synthetic version of folate found in many supplements and multivitamins -- has been shown to lower homocysteine in previous studies, but its effect on disease risk is disputed.\n\nA National Institutes of Health panel recently concluded that there are no foods or vitamins that definitively prevent the development of Alzheimer's disease, and experts say this study is consistent with the panel's recommendations. \"A healthy diet likely remains important,\" Seshadri says. \"The role of supplementation remains unclear.\"\n\nHealth.com: Ginkgo doesn't work: are there better ways to save your brain?\n\nMaria Carillo, Ph.D., the senior director of medical and scientific relations at the Alzheimer's Association, a nonprofit research and advocacy group, urges caution in interpreting the new findings, especially given that so few study participants developed the disease.\n\n\"We do know that vitamin B12 is a huge contributor to lowering homocysteine levels,\" she says. \"Lowering these in general is important for cardiovascular health, and this study strengthens our knowledge about its role in risk for Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\nDr. Sam Gandy, M.D., the associate director of the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, in New York City, says that it may make sense for people to get blood tests to measure their levels of B12 and folate.\n\nHealth.com: How to age-proof your memory\n\nHowever, he says, the study findings may not necessarily translate to people outside Scandinavia. And he worries that the results may spur doctors to recommend B12 injections to their patients -- a preventive treatment that he says is unfounded and already overused.\n\nIt's still unclear whether increasing your intake of vitamin B12 will help protect you from Alzheimer's, Gandy says. \"Good nutrition should minimize the risk of Alzheimer's disease, but we can't say that any specific food has been proven to reduce this risk.\"", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Newswise \u2014 SAN FRANCISCO, March 16, 2017\u2014-Patients in their 80s and 90s who have early stage lung cancer but cannot undergo an operation can be treated safely and effectively with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), according to research presented today at the 2017 Multidisciplinary Thoracic Cancers Symposium. The advanced form of radiation therapy (RT) was well tolerated among this relatively understudied elderly population, indicating that SBRT is a viable option for patients who may otherwise be offered no curative treatment.\n\nWhile the primary treatment for early stage lung cancer is surgical removal of the tumor, some patients may not be able to tolerate surgery due to health status, advanced age or other factors. For these patients, the best curative option is SBRT, a specialized type of external beam RT that uses advanced imaging techniques to deliver extremely targeted radiation to a tumor. This high degree of precision makes SBRT particularly effective at sparing surrounding healthy tissue, which is important for tumor sites near essential organs, such as the heart and lungs. Patients complete SBRT treatment in three to five days, compared with several weeks for conventional RT.\n\n\u201cWhile multiple studies and trials have established the effectiveness of SBRT for inoperable early-stage lung cancer, one of the common reasons for not giving radiation in older patients is concern about tolerating the treatment and potential side effects,\u201d said Richard J. Cassidy III, MD, lead author of the study and a resident in radiation oncology at Emory University\u2019s Winship Cancer Institute in Atlanta. \u201cThe low rates of side effects from SBRT for this elderly population in our study indicate that these concerns should not prevent physicians from considering definitive treatment for their inoperable octogenarian and nonagenarian patients with early stage lung cancer.\u201d\n\nFindings are based on a retrospective analysis of 58 consecutive patients who received definitive lung SBRT across four academic sites within Emory between 2010 and 2015. All patients were age 80 or older at the time of their diagnosis, with a median age of 84.9 years. Forty percent of the tumors were adenocarcinomas, while 29 percent were squamous cell carcinomas and 31 percent did not have a biopsy. Fifty percent of patients who did not have a biopsy had a previous history of lung cancer. Researchers used logistic regression and proportional hazard testing to determine the association of patient, tumor and treatment characteristics to compare rates of survival, recurrence and progression and assess the influence of patient and disease characteristics. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was conducted to determine which patients were most likely to benefit from therapy.\n\nAt two years following definitive SBRT for lung cancer among elderly patients, survival rates were 73 percent for cancer specific survival (CSS) and 57 percent for overall survival (OS). CSS rates were higher for patients who were not active smokers but lower for patients who were older or had a previous lung cancer diagnosis (smoking Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.14, p = 0.03; age HR = 1.19, p = 0.04; cancer HR = 7.75, p = 0.01). OS rates were higher for patients with higher Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), which measures a patient\u2019s functional ability to perform ordinary tasks, such as work and self-care (HR = 0.91; p < 0.01). Researchers determined that this metric should be considered when offering SBRT in this elderly population, with certain performance status criterion (i.e., KPS \u2265 75) associated with significantly improved outcomes. Two-year estimates of local control and regional control were 84.5 percent and 71.7 percent, respectively. Local failure was more common among patients with adenocarcinomas (HR = 6.36, p = 0.01) and less common for patients with T1 tumors (HR = 0.20, p < 0.01). Higher KPS scores were associated with lower rates of both local failure (HR = 0.92, p < 0.01) and regional failure (HR = 0.94, p < 0.01). In terms of toxicity, just over one-third of patients (34.5%) experienced radiation pneumonitis of any grade, with only two patients experiencing grade 3+ pneumonitis. Pneumonitis was more frequent among patients who were not actively using ace-inhibitors (Odds Ratio (OR) = 3.49, p = 0.02) and less frequent in smaller tumors (OR = 0.03, p < 0.01).\n\n\u201cOur study, along with other studies, helps to show that SBRT can effectively and safely add years to the lives of elderly patients who have early stage lung cancer but cannot undergo an operation for it,\u201d said Dr. Cassidy. \u201cElderly patients, who are otherwise doing well, should not have treatment withheld based solely on concerns about side effects and age.\u201d\n\nThe abstract, \u201cStereotactic body radiotherapy for early stage non-small cell lung cancer in patients 80 years and older: A multi-center analysis,\u201d will be presented in detail during the poster session at the 2017 Multidisciplinary Thoracic Cancers Symposium in San Francisco (full details below).

The findings were published today in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. The study followed 826 participants in a clinical trial for a median of 6.5 years after they were treated with surgery and chemotherapy. Those who regularly consumed at least two, one-ounce servings of nuts each week demonstrated a 42% improvement in disease-free survival and a 57% improvement in overall survival. \u201cFurther analysis of this cohort revealed that disease-free survival increased by 46% among the subgroup of nut consumers who ate tree nuts rather than peanuts,\u201d said Charles S. Fuchs, M.D., director of Yale Cancer Center and senior author of the study. Tree nuts include almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts, cashews, and pecans, among others. In contrast, peanuts are actually in the legume family of foods. \u201cThese findings are in keeping with several other observational studies that indicate that a slew of healthy behaviors \u2014 including increased physical activity, keeping a healthy weight, and lower intake of sugar and sweetened beverages \u2014 improve colon cancer outcomes,\u201d said Temidayo Fadelu, M.D., a postdoctoral fellow at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and lead author of the paper. \u201cThe results highlight the importance of emphasizing dietary and lifestyle factors in colon cancer survivorship.\u201d Additionally, the researchers emphasized, the study highlighted connections between biological mechanisms that worsen disease not just in colon cancer but in certain chronic illnesses such as type 2 diabetes. Many previous studies have reported that nuts, among other health benefits, may help to reduce insulin resistance, a condition in which the body has difficulty processing the insulin hormone. Insulin resistance leads to unhealthy levels of sugar in the blood and is often a predecessor to type 2 diabetes and related illnesses. Earlier research among patients with colon cancer has revealed worse outcomes among those with lifestyle factors \u2014 such as obesity, lack of exercise, and a diet with high levels of carbohydrates \u2014 that heighten insulin resistance and quickly raise levels of blood sugar. \u201cThese studies support the hypothesis that behaviors that make you less insulin-resistant, including eating nuts, seem to improve outcomes in colon cancer,\u201d Fuchs said. \u201cHowever, we don\u2019t know yet what exactly about nuts is beneficial.\u201d Nuts also might play a positive role by satisfying hunger with less intake of carbohydrates or other foods associated with poor outcomes, Fuchs noted. Patients may not be eating nuts due to concerns about the high fat content, said Fuchs. For example, a one-ounce serving of about 24 almonds holds about 200 calories, including 14 grams of fat. \u201cPeople ask me if increasing nut consumption will lead to obesity, which leads to worse outcomes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what\u2019s really interesting is that in our studies, and across the scientific literature in general, regular consumers of nuts tend to be leaner.\u201d Dietary changes can make a difference. An earlier analysis of diets in the same patient cohort by Fuchs and his colleagues found a significant link between coffee consumption and reduced recurrence and mortality in colon cancer. When Fuchs advises his patients about lifestyle choices, \u201cfirst and foremost I talk about avoiding obesity, exercising regularly, and staying away from a high-carbohydrate diet,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we talk about things like coffee and nuts. If you like coffee or nuts, enjoy them, and if you don\u2019t, there are many other helpful steps you can take.\u201d \u201cOverall, we are working to apply the same rigorous science to the understanding of diet and lifestyles in the colon cancer patient population that we apply to defining new drugs,\u201d Fuchs said. Co-corresponding authors on the paper are Jeffrey Meyerhardt, M.D., of Dana-Farber and Ying Bao, M.D., of Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital.

It measures the amount of AMH circulating in a women\u2019s bloodstream. This hormone is released by follicles in the ovaries and predicts the amount of possible eggs a woman has. The higher the result the more eggs, the lower the result the fewer eggs. The test doesn\u2019t measure the quality of the eggs and it\u2019s not a guarantee of fertility.

The shot turned off a newly identified cholesterol regulator, PCSK9, which interferes with the liver's ability to clear bad cholesterol from the bloodstream.\n\nThe findings were presented Monday at the American Heart Association (AHA) annual meeting in Orlando, Fla. The study was funded by AMG145 manufacturer Amgen Inc.\n\nHigh cholesterol is a major risk factor for heart disease. The first step toward lowering cholesterol is typically lifestyle changes, which include eating a low-fat diet and regular physical activity. For some, medications such as statins must be added to get cholesterol levels where they ought to be. Even this is not enough to get everyone's numbers into the safety zone, and not everyone can tolerate currently available medications. An LDL of less than 100 mg/dL of blood is considered optimal.\n\nStudy author Clapton Dias, medical sciences director of clinical pharmacology and early development at Amgen, in Thousand Oaks, Calif., said this shot could be given as an add-on to current cholesterol-lowering therapies for people who are not getting as low as they should be or as a standalone treatment for people who can't tolerate existing lipid-lowering drugs.\n\n\"Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the U.S., and while statins are very effective, a good proportion of people are not meeting their goals, and in this setting the shot could be a valuable addition,\" he said.\n\nThe study included 54 men and two women aged 18 to 45 who did not have elevated cholesterol levels. Participants received one of five doses of the new drug delivered via shot or intravenously or a placebo. Researchers measured LDL cholesterol levels for 85 to 113 days after treatment.\n\nThe new drug did hit its target, PCSK9, and decreased levels of LDL cholesterol by up to 64 percent. There were also decreases seen in levels of total cholesterol and apo-B (tiny fat particles in the blood that also increase the risk for heart disease). Levels of triglycerides and \"good\" HDL cholesterol were not altered by the medication, and there were no serious side effects reported. Now, researchers are testing the new shot in people who have high cholesterol.\n\nCardiologists were cautiously optimistic about the novel therapy.\n\nFormer AHA President Dr. Ralph Sacco said that it is too early to make any predictions about what role, if any, this therapy will have in lowering cholesterol levels, but it could one day fill an important void.\n\n\"Even though statins are so effective at lowering cholesterol and reducing risk for heart disease and stroke, they do need to be taken every day and they can have certain side effects in some people,\" said Sacco, who is also chairman of neurology at the University of Miami. Statin side effects can include liver damage and/or muscle pain.\n\n\"This new shot may provide a more long-lasting approach, especially if it could be given once a month,\" Sacco said.\n\nDr. Dan Rader, director of preventive cardiology at the University of Pennsylvania, said that PCSK9 is \"the hottest target for new treatments to lower LDL cholesterol.\" And these study results will probably fuel that fire, he added.\n\n\"A 60-plus percent reduction in LDL with a single dose of this antibody is impressive,\" he said. \"It is the early days, but the data look strong. We now need more data with people who have repeated dosing and are followed for longer periods of time,\" Rader added.\n\n\"There are still plenty of people who can't achieve adequate LDL levels with existing drugs, including statins,\" he noted.

But the treatment can be risky because the patient's immune system has to be wiped out before the stem cells are transplanted, the researchers said.\n\nIn fact, nearly 3 percent of the patients died shortly after receiving the transplant, and those deaths were directly related to the transplant, the researchers reported.\n\nThose deaths are a major concern, one neurologist said, because MS is not in itself life-threatening.\n\nIn effect, those patients gambled with a treatment that could be fatal for a disease that isn't, said Dr. Michael Racke, a professor in the department of neurology at Ohio State University.\n\nRacke pointed out that stem cell transplants were first used to treat deadly diseases, such as leukemia, lymphoma and other cancers.\n\n\"There may be a population of MS patients that could be identified that might do well with transplant,\" he said. \"It's important to select patients in such a way that they actually get well with the transplant.\"\n\nA trial that compares stem cell transplants with other therapies to see whether stem cell transplants can become a treatment for patients who have progressive MS is about to start, added Racke, who co-authored an editorial that accompanied the study.\n\nMore than 2 million people in the world suffer from MS, in which the body attacks the central nervous system, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.\n\nMS can cause many symptoms, including blurred vision, loss of balance, poor coordination, slurred speech, tremors, numbness, extreme fatigue, problems with memory and concentration, paralysis and blindness.\n\nThese symptoms can come and go, or persist and worsen over time. Most people are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, although individuals as young as 2 and as old as 75 have developed the disease, the society says.\n\nMedications can slow the progression of MS and help patients manage symptoms, but there's no cure.\n\nTo see how patients did over the long term after stem cell transplants, Saccardi and colleagues followed 281 patients from 13 countries who received stem cell transplants between 1995 and 2006.\n\nThe researchers found that 46 percent of the patients experienced progression-free survival at five years after transplant.\n\nWithin 100 days of transplant, however, eight patients died (nearly 3 percent). Those deaths were related to the transplants, Saccardi said.\n\nThe researchers think these deaths were most likely due to the transplant technology used before 2006, which has since improved.\n\nThe report was published online Feb. 20 in the journal JAMA Neurology.\n\nDr. Paul Wright is chair of neurology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., and Long Island Jewish Medical Center, in New Hyde Park, N.Y.

That included decreased pain and increased ability to do daily tasks without pain; less fatigue, depression and anxiety; and an overall better quality of life. Patients also reported better sleep quality and improved physical conditioning.\n\nThe improvements were still evident at 24 weeks, according to the research reported in the Aug. 19 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\n\"It was incredible,\" said lead study author Dr. Chenchen Wang, an associate professor of medicine in the rheumatology department at Tufts Medical Center in Boston. \"You could see them change every week. They became very happy. I felt very, very excited to be with them.\"\n\nFibromyalgia is characterized by widespread pain, fatigue, insomnia and multiple tender points. The syndrome can also cause psychological issues, including anxiety, depression, and memory and concentration problems, sometimes called the \"fibromyalgia fog.\"\n\nAbout 10 million Americans have fibromyalgia, and about 75 percent to 90 percent of them are women, according to estimates from the National Fibromyalgia Association.\n\nDoctors will often suggest exercise, sleep hygiene techniques and medications to treat the condition, but often with limited success, said Dr. Gloria Yeh, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, who wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal.\n\nMost patients, according to background information in the article, remain in pain years after the diagnosis, are aerobically unfit, have poor muscle strength and flexibility, and need medications to control symptoms.\n\nWhile larger studies are needed to confirm the findings, tai chi looks promising as an alternative treatment, Yeh said.\n\n\"This could represent an ideal exercise for fibromyalgia sufferers. Since it is a low-impact, gentle, non-threatening, accessible activity, it may be a perfect exercise for debilitated patients with fibromyalgia who otherwise cannot or choose not to do other forms of exercise,\" Yeh said. \"Also, since tai chi has a meditative component, it may also help to address the stress and anxiety that may be associated with the condition.\"\n\nSo what is it about tai chi that works?\n\nThere's no definitive answer to that just yet, Wang said. Tai chi is a mind-body exercise that originated as a martial art in China, utilizing slow, gentle movements to build strength and flexibility, as well as deep breathing and relaxation, to move qi, or vital energy, throughout the body.\n\nPrior research has shown exercise can improve mood, Wang added. The controlled breathing and movements may promote \"mental tranquility,\" according to the study, which could help with pain.\n\n\"The physical component of tai chi can improve aerobic capacity, strength and muscle function,\" Wang said. \"But in my opinion, the most important part is mental. You see lots of patients improve their depression and become good friends with each other.\"\n\nThe National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine of the U.S. National Institutes of Health provided funding for the research.\n\nThe National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine has more on tai chi.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story does cite the opinions of a researcher who wrote an accompanying article in the journal.

Coffee did not decrease the risk of a third type of oral cancer \u2013 laryngeal cancer. They looked at nine existing studies and analyzed how much coffee was consumed by more than 5,000 cancer patients and about 9,000 healthy people.\n\nWhile these results are encouraging, it doesn't mean we should just go out and start drinking lots of coffee, says Mia Hashibe, lead researcher and an assistant professor in the department of family and preventive medicine at the University of Utah.\n\nHashibe points out that the main risk factors for oral cancers are smoking and drinking alcohol. She says the best way to prevent getting these cancers is to not smoke or drink alcohol, rather than drinking lots of coffee. \"We wouldn't want to be encouraging people to drink that much [coffee], without people considering the other risks factors,\" Hashibe says. \"Each person needs to think about how they metabolize caffeine or coffee.\"\n\nIn the past, there\u2019s been a perception that coffee may be bad for you, according to Dr. Donald Hensrud, chair of preventive medicine at the Mayo Clinic. But he says that newer studies suggest that drinking coffee may actually be good for you. \"Like many things, the evidence changes over time,\" says Hensrud. He adds that when it comes to the link between coffee and head and neck cancer, \"the benefits outweigh the risks and this is just one more piece of that puzzle that supports that.\"\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly known why coffee may help prevent these cancers. But coffee contains over 1,000 different chemical compounds, including cancer-fighting antioxidants, and it\u2019s those antioxidants that may provide a \u201cplausible explanation\u201d for reducing the cancer risk, says Hensrud.\n\nOther recent studies suggest coffee may have beneficial effects in other diseases like dementia, diabetes, liver and Parkinson's disease. However, coffee alone may not be the answer according to some experts. Dr. Dong Shin, a head and neck specialist at Emory Winship Cancer Institute says this new study suggests \u201cthere is a hint of beneficial outcomes\" with coffee and oral cancer. But he is concerned that the side effects of coffee are not addressed in this study. Shin says when it comes to preventing cancer, the combination approach is best. He suggests \u201cconsuming coffee, tea, veggies, and fruits rather than doing just one thing.\"\n\nHensrud adds that there are some drawbacks to drinking too much coffee, including liver damage or increased blood pressure. Other possible side effects from drinking a lot of coffee include insomnia, reflux, heartburn, palpitations, urinary systems and increased fluid intake, says Hensrud. He says coffee can also be addictive and some people may suffer from withdrawal headaches. Too much coffee may make it harder to conceive and can increase the risk of miscarriage.\n\nThe study is published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention.\n\nEditor's Note: Medical news is a popular but sensitive subject rooted in science.

", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The report estimates the percentage of cancers caused by CT scans -- currently 0.4 percent -- will increase to as much as 2 percent in a few decades because the number of scans has increased so dramatically, reports CBS News medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook.\n\n\"Our concern is there are so many CT scans being done right now that we should really be starting to think: Do we need to all of these CT scans?\" says Dr. David Brenner of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University.\n\nSome experts say that estimate is overly alarming. But they agree with the need to curb these tests particularly in children, who are more susceptible to radiation and more likely to develop cancer from it.\n\n\"There are some serious concerns about the methodology used,\" but the authors \"have brought to attention some real serious potential public health issues,\" said Dr. Arl Van Moore, head of the American College of Radiology's board of chancellors.\n\nThe radiation and risk from one CT scan is low, but it carries a dose 50 to 100 times greater than a traditional X-ray, reports LaPook.\n\n\"We are very concerned about the built-up public health risk over a long period of time,\" said Eric J. Hall, who wrote the report with fellow Columbia University medical physicist David J. Brenner.\n\nSo what's a patient to do? Make sure your doctor explains why you need a CT scan and gives you the lowest possible dose, reports LaPook. It's also a good idea to keep a diary of X-ray exposure, especially for children.\n\nThe study was published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine and paid for by federal grants.\n\nThe average American's total radiation exposure has nearly doubled since 1980, largely because of CT, or computed tomography, scans. Medical radiation now accounts for more than half of the population's total exposure; it used to be just one-sixth, and the top source was the normal background rate in the environment, from things like radon in soil and cosmic energy from the sun.\n\nA previous study by the same scientists in 2001 led the federal Food and Drug Administration to recommend ways to limit scans and risks in children.\n\nBut CT use continued to soar. About 62 million scans were done in the U.S. last year, up from 3 million in 1980. More than 4 million were in children.\n\nSince previous studies suggest that a third of all diagnostic tests are unnecessary, that means that 20 million adults and more than 1 million children getting CT scans are needlessly being put at risk, Brenner and Hall write.\n\nUltrasound and MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging, scans often are safer options that do not expose people to radiation, they contend.\n\nCT scans became popular because they offer a quick, relatively cheap and painless way to get 3D pictures so detailed they give an almost surgical view into the body. Doctors use them to evaluate trauma, belly pain, seizures, chronic headaches, kidney stones and other woes, especially in busy emergency rooms. In kids, they are used to diagnose or rule out appendicitis.\n\n\"The CT scan is a wonderful tool for examining internal organs, organs that are below the depth of where a poking finger or a listening stethoscope can hear, and yet don't show up on routine X-rays,\" Dr. Michael Brant-Zawadzki, a clinical professor of radiology at Stanford University tells CBS News.\n\nBut they put out a lot of radiation. A CT scan of the chest involves 10 to 15 millisieverts (a measure of dose) versus 0.01 to 0.15 for a regular chest X-ray, 3 for a mammogram and a mere 0.005 for a dental X-ray.\n\nThe dose depends on the type of machine and the person - obese people require more radiation than slim ones - and the risk accumulates over a lifetime.\n\n\"Medical care in this country is naturally so fragmented. Any one doctor is not going to be aware of the fact that a particular patient has had three or four CT scans at some point in the past,\" said Dr. Michael Lauer, prevention chief at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.\n\nPeople with chronic problems like kidney stones are likely to get too many scans, said Dr. Fred Mettler, radiology chief in the New Mexico Veterans Administration health care system.\n\n\"I've seen people who are 30 years old who have had at least 18 scans done,\" he said.\n\nThat puts them at risk of developing radiation-induced cancer, Brenner and Hall said. They base this on studies of thousands of Japanese atomic bomb survivors who had excess cancer risk after exposures of 50 to 150 millisieverts - the equivalent of several big CT scans.\n\n\"That's very controversial. There's a large portion of the medical physics community that would disagree with that\" comparison, said Richard Morin, a medical physicist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Fla.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The reporter interviewed two sources in the story.\u00a0 One was the first author of the article being reported on.\u00a0 One appeared not to be involved in the study reported on.\u00a0 It would have been helpful to clearly identify the doctors beyond their names to explain why they were interviewed.

They hope the technology can be commercialized and marketed to prevent the spread of seasonal flu in public places, such as schools, hospitals, and airports.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known for a century that UV light is extremely efficient at killing microbes, bacteria, and viruses,\u201d says study leader David Brenner, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. For that reason, UV devices are often used for sterilization \u2014 for medical equipment in hospitals, for example, or drinking water for backcountry campers.\n\nBut conventional germicidal lamps aren\u2019t safe for humans to be around. With prolonged exposure, they can cause skin cancer and cataracts in the eyes. \u201cSo up until now, they\u2019re only really practical when people aren\u2019t around,\u201d say Brenner. \u201cYou can sterilize a hospital room, but not when anyone\u2019s inside.\u201d\n\nAbout five years ago, Brenner says, the Columbia team came up with a potential solution. Light on the far end of the UV-C spectrum, known as far-UVC, has very short wavelengths. The researchers suspected that it can penetrate and destroy microscopic bacteria and viruses, but can\u2019t travel through the protective outer layers of human skin or eyes.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to get all the benefits of UV light in terms of killing microbes, but none of the health hazards,\u201d says Brenner. Earlier studies, on animals and humans, have shown that exposure to far-UVC light does indeed appear to be safe. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any biological damage to skin cells or eye cells, whereas with conventional UV light we\u2019ve always seen lots of biological damage,\u201d he says. Previous research has also shown that far-UVC light can kill MRSA bacteria, a common cause of infections after surgery.\n\nNow, Brenner and his colleagues have show that UVC light can effectively kill airborne influenza. In their new study, aerosolized particles of the H1N1 seasonal flu virus were released into a test chamber and exposed to very low doses of far-UVC light. The light inactivated the viruses with about the same efficiency as conventional germicidal UV light, while a control group of bacteria not exposed to light remained active.\n\n\u201cWe think that this type of overhead light could be efficacious for basically any public setting,\u201d says Brenner. \u201cThink about doctor\u2019s waiting rooms, schools, airports and airplanes\u2014any place where there\u2019s a likelihood for airborne viruses.\u201d And unlike the flu vaccine, he says, far-UVC light is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes, including newly emerging virus strains.\n\nBrenner says his team is working with a company to develop a commercially available version of the lamp, which could become a cost-effective way to battle flu epidemics on a population level. \u201cThe lamp we\u2019re using at the moment costs less than $1,000, and you can imagine that if it were put into general circulation, the price would drop dramatically,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t see cost as being a limiting factor here.\u201d\n\nUVC lamps could also have potential implications in clinical settings, as well \u2014 in the operating room during surgeries, for example. \u201cNo matter how well you sterilize a room beforehand, the medical staff can still bring in dangerous bacteria like MRSA,\u201d says Brenner. \u201cIf you have a lamp over the surgical site that can sterilize the air, you can prevent the bacteria from floating down and contaminating the wound.\u201d\n\nBrenner can\u2019t predict how long it might take for these lamps to be commercially available, but he says he\u2019s \u201cextremely optimistic\u201d about the technology. \u201cThere has been no way of killing viruses in the air in public spaces, and this is an approach that may solve that problem.\u201d", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The lead author of the story is the only source cited, and we\u2019re not told if he has any conflicts of interest.

First author is Dipen Parekh, MD, of the University of Miami.\n\nLoyola is among 15 centers that participated in the nationwide trial of 350 patients, who were randomly assigned to undergo robotic surgery or open surgery to remove cancerous bladders.\n\nAfter two years, there was no significant difference between the two groups in survival without disease progression. Robotic surgery was associated with less blood loss and shorter hospital stays, but longer surgeries. There were no significant differences in complication rates or in patients' quality of life. The study is called RAZOR (randomized open versus robotic cystectomy trial) and was funded by the National Cancer Institute.\n\nA robotic system allows a surgeon to perform operations through a few small incisions. Movements by the surgeon's hand or wrist are translated into highly precise movements of the surgical instruments. Every maneuver is directed by the surgeon, in real time, as the surgeon views a magnified, 3D, high-definition image of the surgical site.\n\nSince robotic surgery was introduced in 2000, it has spread rapidly and has been used in about four million surgeries worldwide. But apart from the RAZOR trial, there have been no prospective, randomized multicenter trials to assess how robotic surgery compares to open surgery in cancer survival.\n\nThe RAZOR trial found that two years after surgery, 72.3 percent of patients in the robotic surgery group were alive, with no disease progression and essentially cured, compared with 71.6 percent in the open surgery group. Sixty-seven percent of robotic surgery patients experienced adverse effects such as urinary tract infections and intestinal obstructions, compared with 69 percent in the open surgery group.\n\nRobotic surgery patients stayed a median of six days in the hospital, compared with seven days in the open surgery group. Robotic surgery patients lost less than half as much blood as open surgery patients, but spent more time in the operating room (seven hours, eight minutes compared with six hours, one minute).\n\nResearchers wrote that the findings \"underscore the need for further high-quality trials to assess surgical innovation before this surgical technique is widely adopted in clinical practice.\"\n\nDr. Gupta added that the study provides evidence demonstrating that the robotic approach performs at least as well as the open approach. \"It is important to conduct these trials before widespread adoption of technology, as has been the case with robotic prostatectomy (removal of the prostate),\" he said.\n\nThe study is titled \"Robot-assisted radical cystectomy versus open radical cystectomy in patients with bladder cancer (RAZOR): an open-label, randomized, phase 3, non-inferiority trial.\"\n\nBladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men, but it is less common in women. The American Cancer Society estimates this year there will be about 81,000 new cases in the United States, and about 17,000 people will die of the disease.\n\nThe standard surgical treatment of invasive bladder cancer is a radical cystectomy (removal of the bladder). Three main techniques are used to replace the bladder: construct a new bladder (neobladder) from the patient's intestine; place a pouch inside the body to act as an artificial bladder; or place a bag outside the body to collect urine. Loyola Medicine offers both open and robotic radical cystectomy and all three bladder replacement techniques. There are pros and cons to each surgical technique, and Loyola physicians help patients decide which option best fits their lifestyle and health status.\n\nLoyola Medicine is nationally recognized for its expertise in diagnosing and treating a broad range of urologic conditions and providing integrated services for optimal patient care.

However, a study published in January in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society found that a pre-bedtime cocktail of magnesium, zinc and a five-milligram dose of melatonin significantly improved sleep among a group of 43 elderly Italian insomniacs.\n\nJason Healy, the head of InterMark Brands, which markets Snooz'n, says he drinks his product on nights when he is stressed-out or when he is traveling internationally. The back of the Snooz'n bottle says the beverage will \"combat stress, energy drinks and sleeplessness\" and takes about 30 minutes to take effect. When it launches nationally in March, Snooz'n will be available in grocery and convenience stores and pharmacies, like most of these drinks.\n\n\"We attack [insomnia] from two angles,\" Healy says. \"You've got to turn off all the stimulants and also get into a natural sleep cycle.\"\n\nMelatonin is used for the latter, while ingredients such as valerian root and chamomile take care of the former, Healy says. Both of those herbs are associated with soporific effects, according to the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database. Valerian root has properties that resemble the benzodiazepine class of medications (such as Valium and Xanax), but Scharf says he has no idea how they compare with standard sleeping pills because of the lack of comparative studies.\n\nContainers of relaxation drinks look similar to those of energy drinks. Many mimic the diminutive shape of the 5-Hour Energy shot or the bright graphics and tall, narrow can of Rockstar or Monster. Flavors range from a pleasant, fruit-flavored soda to just shy of cough syrup.\n\nMany relaxation beverages contain safety labels that warn consumers that they should neither drive or operate machinery after drinking them, nor mix them with alcohol. Some say they aren't intended for people younger than 18 or for pregnant or nursing women - a warning that the Food and Drug Administration has also made about melatonin.\n\nIn January 2010, the FDA sent a warning letter to the Innovative Beverage Group, which makes the relaxation beverage Drank, saying the melatonin it uses is an \"unapproved food additive\" and not \"generally recognized as safe.\"\n\nDrank is still being sold with melatonin in it. In a statement, Drank inventor Peter Bianchi says \"the safety of Drank's consumers remains a top priority\" and the company is working to modify the product's packaging and marketing \"to reflect its classification as a dietary supplement.\"\n\nThe FDA regulates conventional beverages' ingredients and labeling claims more strictly than those of dietary supplements. Drank is still classified as a beverage.\n\nThe relaxation drink market is tiny compared with the energy drink market, says Garima Goel Lal, a senior analyst at the consumer research firm Mintel.\n\nA Mintel survey found that 48 percent of all \"functional beverage\" users said they were looking for beverages to release stress.\n\nA functional beverage - the term is used for sport, energy and relaxation drinks - is a nonalcoholic drink that claims to have health benefits. The number of nonalcoholic beverages making relaxation claims continues to rise; 40 new ones came on the market in 2010, according to Mintel. The field is too young to identify the leaders and the losers, Goel Lal says.\n\n\"They're trying to find a niche,\" she says.\n\nKatherine Zeratsky, a registered dietitian at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., has blogged about relaxation drinks. She says that people with certain health conditions, such as high blood pressure, should consult their physician before downing a can of Unwind or any of the other sleep beverages.\n\n\"A person can just go to the convenience store and purchase this,\" Zeratsky says. \"There's this perception that it's safe and, depending on the person, it might not be a good choice.\"", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story quotes a physician sleep expert, a dietitian, and an employee of one of the beverage companies.

(Aug. 22, 2017) - A study led by researchers at Cedars-Sinai and NeuroVision Imaging LLC provides the scientific basis for using noninvasive eye imaging to detect the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's. The experimental technology, developed by Cedars-Sinai and NeuroVision, scans the retina using techniques that can identify beta-amyloid protein deposits that mirror those in the brain.\n\nAccumulations of neurotoxic beta-amyloid protein can be detected with positron emission tomography, or PET scans, and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid, but these are invasive, inconvenient and costly, making them impractical for routine screening and follow-up evaluation.\n\n\"This is the first study demonstrating the potential to image and quantify retinal findings related to beta-amyloid plaques noninvasively in living patients using a retinal scan with high resolution. This clinical trial is reinforced by an in-depth exploration of the accumulation of beta-amyloid in the retina of Alzheimer's patients versus matched controls, and a comparison analysis between retina and brain pathologies. Findings from this study strongly suggest that retinal imaging can serve as a surrogate biomarker to investigate and monitor Alzheimer's disease,\" said Maya Koronyo-Hamaoui, Ph.D., an associate professor of Neurosurgery and Biomedical Sciences and a research scientist at the Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute at Cedars-Sinai, and a co-founder, inventor and scientist at NeuroVision. She is the senior leading author of an article in JCI Insight published online Aug. 17.\n\n\"As a developmental outgrowth of the central nervous system that shares many of the brain's characteristics, the retina may offer a unique opportunity for us to easily and conveniently detect and monitor Alzheimer's disease,\" said Keith L. Black, M.D., chairman of NeuroVision, chair of the Department of Neurosurgery and director of the Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute at Cedars-Sinai. \"We know that Alzheimer's begins as many as 10 or 20 years before cognitive decline becomes evident, and we believe that potential treatments may be more effective if they can be started early in the process. Therefore, screening and early detection may be crucial to our efforts to turn the tide against the growing threat of this devastating disease.\"\n\nSteven Verdooner, NeuroVision CEO, said the imaging system leverages the company's expertise in autofluorescence imaging of the retina using a specialized ophthalmic camera and sophisticated image processing software. \"It's exciting to see these studies demonstrating the power of the technology applied to the Alzheimer's field. Our goal is to develop a product that is easy to use, affordable and widely accessible. We look forward to the potential of retinal imaging playing a vital role in solving the problem of Alzheimer's, both in identifying and monitoring those who may be affected by the disease. Our next step is to continue with clinical trials, building upon the existing pharmaceutical company collaborations, to ensure our technology is ready for the medical community to help manage this disease.\"\n\nThe study's first author, Yosef Koronyo, a research associate at Cedars-Sinai and a scientist and inventor at NeuroVision, said the latest findings cap a decade of study that has produced several landmark discoveries. \"In 2010, our research group published an article providing the first evidence for the existence of Alzheimer's-specific plaques in the human retina, and we demonstrated the ability to detect individual plaques in live mouse models using a modified ophthalmic device.\"\n\nAfter adapting the technology for human application, the researchers initiated several ongoing clinical trials in the United States and Australia to determine the feasibility of detecting and quantifying beta-amyloid plaques in patients with the disease.\n\nIn the new article, the researchers report on a 16-patient clinical trial to demonstrate the feasibility of identifying beta-amyloid in the eye using autofluorescence imaging. They also provide detailed analyses and several new findings on Alzheimer's pathology in the retina, results of research with donated eyes and brains of 37 deceased patients, 23 with confirmed Alzheimer's disease and 14 controls.\n\nAmong key findings, the researchers report a 4.7-fold increase in retinal plaque burden in patients with Alzheimer's, compared to controls, and they provide observations regarding geometric distribution and layer location of amyloid pathology in the retina. With the imaging technology's ability to detect autofluorescence signal related to retinal beta-amyloid, these findings may lead to a practical approach for large-scale identification of the at-risk population and monitoring of Alzheimer's, the researchers say.\n\nThe article provides new insights into the disease's manifestations in the retina and information on the optical imaging system. Here are several highlights:\n\u2022 The first histologic quantitative analysis of retinal plaque clusters, or \"hot spots,\" containing the most toxic forms of beta-amyloid with specific distribution patterns in superior peripheral regions that were previously unexplored.\n\u2022 The first report of certain Alzheimer's-related pathologies in the retina, including vascular amyloid pathology.\n\u2022 The demonstration of a significant correlation between retinal and brain plaques, and coexistence of neuronal loss.\n\u2022 The first feasibility study for noninvasively detecting presumed amyloid deposits in retinas of living patients.\n\u2022 The demonstration of a fully automated calculation quantifying retinal autofluorescence that showed a 2.1-fold increase in patients with Alzheimer's, compared with controls.\n\nResearchers from NeuroVision, Cedars-Sinai, the Doheny Eye Institute, Retina Vitreous Associates Medical Group, Retinal Consultants Medical Group, Sutter Neuroscience Institute, UCLA, Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, Veterans Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, and the University of Southern California contributed to the research and article.

The patients (some of whom had been given a low-dose aspirin regimen, while others were not) were tracked for up to 20 years after.\n\nThe authors determined that while the studies were still underway, overall cancer death risk plummeted by 21 percent among those taking low-dose aspirin. But the long-term benefits on some specific cancers began to show five years after the studies ended.\n\nAt five years out, death due to gastrointestinal cancers had sunk by 54 percent among those patients taking low-dose aspirin.\n\nThe protective impact of low-dose aspirin on stomach and colorectal cancer death was not seen until 10 years out, and for prostate cancer, the benefits first appeared 15 years down the road.\n\nTwenty years after first beginning a low-dose aspirin program, death risk dropped by 10 percent among prostate cancer patients; 30 percent among lung cancer patients (although only those with adenocarcinomas, the type typically seen in nonsmokers); 40 percent among colorectal cancer patients; and 60 percent among esophageal cancer patients.\n\nThe potential impact of aspirin on pancreatic, stomach and brain cancer death rates was more problematic to gauge, the authors noted, due to the relative paucity of deaths from those specific diseases.\n\nThey also found that higher doses of aspirin did not appear to boost the protective benefit. And while neither gender nor smoking history appeared to affect the impact of low-dose aspirin, age definitely did: the 20-year risk of death went down more dramatically among older patients.\n\nAnd while cautioning that more research is necessary to build on this \"proof of principle,\" the authors suggested that people who embark on a long-term, low-dose aspirin regimen in their late 40s and 50s are probably the ones who stand to benefit the most.\n\nDr. Alan Arslan, an assistant professor in the departments of obstetrics and gynecology and environmental medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, described the findings as \"very significant.\"\n\n\"[This] is the largest study to show that people who take aspirin for a long period of time have a reduced risk of death from many cancers, especially gastrointestinal cancers,\" he noted.\n\n\"The take-home message for patients is that if someone is taking low-dose or regular aspirin, it may put them at a reduced risk of death from cancer,\" Arslan added. \"However, if someone is not already taking aspirin they should talk with their physician before starting.

Similar results were obtained by the National Cancer Institute USA in tests conducted on 60 cell lines.\n\nThe new drug works by forcing cancer cells to use their mitochondria, the \u2018power house\u2019 of a cell, to generate the energy necessary to function. Whilst healthy cells use mitochondria to generate energy, cancer cells contain defective mitochondria which are incapable of sustaining the cell\u2019s energy requirements.\n\nIn the absence of FY26, cancer cells switch from using their defective mitochondria to using metabolic activity in their cytoplasm to generate energy. By stopping this switch of energy source, the drug causes the cancer cell to die.\n\nLead researcher Professor Peter Sadler, of the University of Warwick\u2019s Department of Chemistry, said explains:\n\n\u201cHealthy cells generate their energy in organelles called mitochondria, but cancer cells have defective mitochondria and are forced to generate energy through glycolysis in the cytoplasm. Our new compounds work by attacking the energy balance in cancer cells\u201d.\n\nCommenting on the drug\u2019s benefits when compared to existing platinum-based drugs, such as Cisplatin, Professor Sadler says:\n\n\u201cPlatinum-based drugs are used in nearly 50% of all chemotherapeutic regimens and exert their activity by damaging DNA and cannot select between cancerous and non-cancerous cells. This can lead to a wide-range of side-effects from renal failure to neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, nausea and vomiting.\u201d\n\n\u201cExisting platinum-based cancer treatments often become less effective after the first course, as cancer cells learn how they are being attacked, but our new osmium compound with its different mechanism of action, remains active against cancer cells that have become resistant to drugs such as Cisplatin\u201d.\n\nThe research could also lead to substantial improvements in cancer survival rates, suggests co-researcher Dr Isolda Romero-Canelon:\n\n\u201cCurrent statistics indicate that one in every two people will develop some kind of cancer during their life time, with approximately one woman dying of ovarian cancer every two hours in the UK according to Cancer Research UK and two deaths every hour from bowel cancer.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that a new generation of drugs is necessary to save more lives and our research points to a highly effective way of defeating cancerous cells\u201d.\n\nThe research, supported by the European Research Council and titled Potent organo-osmium compound shifts metabolism in epithelial ovarian cancer cells, is published by PNAS. The paper describes the comprehensive systems biology approach used to elucidate the mechanism of osmium action of FY26, led by PhD student Jess Hearn. Importantly this analysis also pinpointed 3 mutations in the mitochondrial DNA of ovarian cancer cells.\n\nFollowing the successful test results the researchers have been awarded a Wellcome Trust Pathfinder grant to begin preclinical development of organo-osmium compounds.\n\nThe researchers thank the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (Grant 324594, Systems Biology studentship for J.M.H.), the European Research Council (Grants 247450 and 324594), and the Wellcome Trust (Grants 086357 and 102696) for support, as well as the European Union COST Action CM1105.", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The funding sources were carefully noted in the release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A product called the OFF!\u00ae Clip-On\u2122 repellent device could be an effective tool for preventing bites from the Aedes aegypti mosquito -- the primary vector of Zika, chikungunya, dengue, and yellow fever -- according to an article in the Journal of Medical Entomology.\n\nThe OFF!

Not even at the beach in July.\n\nToenail fungus causes nails to become thick, yellow and brittle in a way that looks pretty ugly and can be painful. Sufferers can spend years and hundreds of dollars trying to clear the infection with drugs, topical treatments and home remedies, sometimes to no avail. It tends to be a cosmetic issue for the younger set and a pain issue for older folks.\n\n\u201cThe problem is huge. It is bigger than you can imagine,\u201d says Washington podiatrist Stephen J. Kominsky. \u201cI would say 70 percent of the patients who come into my office have fungal infections on their toenails.\u201d\n\nThere may be hope. Podiatrists have begun using a laser treatment that combats the infection \u2014 or wastes their patients\u2019 money because it doesn\u2019t work, depending on whom you ask.\n\nThe treatment, in which the podiatrist aims a laser beam at the patient\u2019s toenails to kill the organisms that cause the fungus, costs about $1,000 and is not covered by insurance because it is considered an aesthetic procedure. The nails aren\u2019t immediately clear after the treatment, which takes up to an hour; the patient must wait for the fungus-free nails to grow out.\n\nLast year, the Food and Drug Administration cleared the first laser, PinPointe, for \u201ctemporary increase of clear nail\u201d in patients with onychomycosis, the medical term for a fungal infection of the nail. The FDA cleared a second one, GenesisPlus, in April. Practitioners have been using other lasers on toenail fungus since about 2009.\n\nKominsky has treated 400 to 500 patients with the PinPointe laser. Compared with oral medication, he says, \u201cthe odds of success are better with the laser; plus, there\u2019s no side effects.\u201d\n\nThe most common oral treatment, Lamisil, works for about two out of three patients, according to Lamisil\u2019s FDA-approved prescribing information, but it has been associated with rare cases of serious liver problems. Other potential side effects include diarrhea, headache, rashes and changes in taste. According to Lamisil\u2019s manufacturer, Novartis, the relapse rate is 15 percent one year after completing treatment.\n\nIn one small study about laser treatment for toenail fungus, which appeared last year in the Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association, \u201c26 eligible toes (ten mild, seven moderate, and nine severe)\u201d were treated with a laser produced by Nomir Medical Technologies, which is still seeking FDA approval. After six months, 85 percent of the toenails had improved.\n\n\u201cI never use the term \u2018cured\u2019 with toenail fungus,\u201d Kominsky says. \u201cWith a cure, people think there\u2019s no chance for a recurrence. In this case, there is a chance.\u201d\n\nEven John Strisower, the founder of PinPointe USA, says patients should expect at least a minimal reinfection within five years after laser treatment.\n\nResearch done by PinPointe, which is based in Chico, Calif., identified more than 100 organisms, including fungi, yeast, mold and bacteria, that work together to cause toenail fungus.\n\nThere\u2019s no one route of infection, but sources include pedicures and locker room showers. Fungi love moist, dark environments such as wet shoes, Kominsky says, so people such as lifeguards, landscapers and fishermen are particularly susceptible. Shoes are the reason why toenail fungus is much more common than fingernail fungus, which can also occur.\n\nThe elderly are more likely to have toenail fungus than younger people because they have had more years to be exposed to the infection and their immune systems can\u2019t always fight it off, according to Washington podiatrist Lee Firestone. He estimates that about half of people over 70 have toenail fungus.\n\nLast year, Americans spent $354 million on prescription and over-the-counter treatments for toenail fungus, according to IMS Health, a health-care information company.\n\n\u201cI think the laser can improve the appearance of the nail, but it\u2019s only temporary and it needs to be used again and again to maintain that improvement,\u201d says Firestone, who doesn\u2019t use the lasers in his practice. \u201cI\u2019ve had patients come in who have had laser procedures and not seen long-term success.\u201d\n\nFirestone also says that over-the-counter antifungal nail creams and ointments rarely work because they can\u2019t penetrate the nail root. Home remedies such as tea tree oil, bleach and vinegar also don\u2019t work, he says.\n\nYet even a superficial improvement would be an improvement for many.\n\nRichard, a retiree in Fairfax who did not want his full name associated with toenail fungus, got a laser treatment on all 10 toes in April 2010, and he says his nails were fully cleared of the yellowed, thickened look after a year.

Brachytherapy also has fewer side effects such as radiation burns.\n\n\"That reduces the potential harm to surrounding organs behind the breast tissue. That was a huge factor in me choosing to do the brachytherapy,\u201d said Cheryl McCartney, 51, a Chouteau Elementary School principal who had brachytherapy done in 2006 at Cancer Treatment Centers of America in Tulsa.\n\nMcCartney had no side effects and remains cancer-free.\n\nThe typical radiation treatment for breast cancer involves about six weeks of daily \"external beam radiation\u201d that treats the entire breast.

Because of the burden, doctors say, many choose to have mastectomies instead.\n\n\"It's a lot shorter, and it's obviously convenient,\u201d said Dr. Doug Kelly, a radiation oncologist with Cancer Treatment Centers. For many women, family and work obligations make a commute to receive treatment a challenge. \"They really have a hard time coming in for six weeks,\u201d he said.\n\nThe shorter treatment duration encouraged McCartney to have brachytherapy.

I think most patients want to get their treatment done as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nAlgan said he doesn't extol one technique over the others; all are acceptable depending on the patient.\n\nIn the multiple-catheter method, a doctor places 10 to 20 \"needles\u201d about one centimeter apart around the tumor cavity, and a machine inserts the radioactive pellet. The procedure requires a hospital stay, at the end of which the needles and pellets are removed.

Participants in the trial received two doses of the vaccine, with the doses given two months apart.\n\nLead researcher Professor Tony Cunningham from the Westmead Institute for Medical Research said the study shows that the vaccine stimulates production of a specific immune memory cell (CD4 T cells), generating a strong and sustained protection against the virus.\n\n\"The body has two types of immunity: protein antibodies and white blood cells known as T cells. As the virus circulates around the body, antibodies block it from entering cells. But when the virus does get into cells your T cells try to kill those infected cells.\n\n\"Our research shows that the vaccine stimulates your immune system to produce more antibodies and it generates a 24-fold increase in T cells. This is 12 times higher than other less effective shingles vaccines.\n\nThe research, published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, shows that Shingrix offers protection for up to four years, but Professor Cunningham believes it will last much longer.\n\n\"The second dose of the vaccine is important to ensure long-term protection,\" Professor Cunningham said.\n\n\"The efficacy is approximately 90% for all age groups--even for those over 70 years of age.\n\n\"This is quite remarkable because there are no other vaccines that perform nearly so well for people in their 70s and their 80s. We are seeing results comparable to those of childhood vaccinations.\n\n\"What's particularly exciting, though, is that 90% of recipients had an increased immune response sustained across the 3-year duration of the study.\n\n\"We anticipate that this protection will actually last much, much longer. We are now measuring the efficacy of the vaccine over the next 10 years and are very optimistic about the results,\" he said.\n\nShingrix is different from most other vaccines. Many vaccines are made from a weakened form of the virus, but Shingrix is made from just a single protein--known as glycoprotein E--that comes from the outer shell of the herpes zoster virus.\n\nThe vaccine also contains an adjuvant--a substance that helps your body fight off the virus. It is the first shingles vaccine to combine a non-live antigen with a specifically designed adjuvant.\n\nShingles is a viral infection, caused by the herpes zoster virus--the same virus that causes chickenpox. The incidence of shingles increases as we get older, because the body's natural immunity declines.\n\n\"When people reach their 50s and 60s, T cell immunity declines allowing shingles to strike. That's why our adult vaccine is directed specifically at T cell immunity,\" Professor Cunningham said.\n\nMost Australian adults have been infected with the herpes zoster virus and are at risk of shingles, even if they do not remember having chicken pox. By age 85, approximately 50% of the population will develop shingles. Vaccination is the only way to protect against shingles.\n\nThe full paper is published online by the Journal of Infectious Diseases as Editor's choice: https:/\n\nThe Shingrix vaccine is developed by GlaxoSmithKline.", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The study was funded by the manufacturer of Shingrix, GlaxoSmithKline, and many of the authors are listed in the study as being GSK employees or having other financial interests in shingles vaccines.

He ate a low-fat diet, did yoga, lifted weights and walked three brisk miles a day.\n\nSo mystery and grief hung heavy when he collapsed from a cardiac arrest Jan. 6 inside the Teutonia M???erchor club on the North Side.\n\nFor 15 minutes, the 58-year-old McKees Rocks borough manager was a goner. \"He was dead -- D-E-A-D -- dead,\" said Dr. Jerome E. Granato, Mr. Beck's cardiologist and medical director of Allegheny General Hospital's Coronary Care Unit.\n\nBut in a happy turn of fate, in large part due to a new therapy offered at AGH, Mr. Beck was revived and now is doing amazingly well.\n\nTwo and a half months after his cardiac arrest -- a disease that kills 250,000 people each year -- he has returned to work part-time at McKees Rocks with plans soon to return full time. He is walking 45 minutes each day with plans soon to return to a full hour.\n\nReasons abound for such startling success after an often-fatal episode. He's physically fit. Several people at the club provided quick cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The ambulance service was close by and transported him without delay to AGH only blocks away.\n\nBut most surprising, he shows no diminished mental capacity after being lost to the world for 15 drama-filled minutes. For those who do survive cardiac arrest, brain damage often occurs, doctors say.\n\nWhich brings us to that new therapy at AGH. When Mr. Beck reached the emergency room that Saturday night, doctors gave him what might be described as the big chill.\n\nFor 24 hours, his body temperature was kept at 91 degrees Fahrenheit, which put him in a state of hibernation. That slowed his metabolism and reduced his need for oxygen in his brain and internal organs.\n\nReducing the oxygen need protects the brain and other organs and lowers the incidence of brain, kidney and other organ damage.\n\nIn the emergency room, AGH doctors followed established hospital criteria and inserted a cooling catheter into the femoral vein in his groin area to cool the blood as it pumped bodywide. It caused Mr. Beck's body temperature to drop almost 8 degrees below the normal 98.6.\n\nThroughout the procedure he remained sedated to prevent shivering. He was unaware his body was on ice.\n\nTwo days later, Dr. Granato saw progress in Mr. Beck, even though he eventually had to fight through a serious case of aspiration pneumonia.\n\nHis near full recovery has made him poster man for hypothermia's success in preserving brain and organ function in cardiac arrest patients.\n\nA heart attack can prompt cardiac arrest -- a situation in which the heart rhythm goes chaotic, making it quiver rather than beat, Dr. Granato said. The heart quits pumping blood, leaving vital organs depleted of oxygen -- a situation that can cause significant damage to the brain, kidneys and other organs, or death if quick emergency action is not taken.\n\nBut an electrolyte imbalance caused by dehydration, influenza or other health problems that deplete the system of potassium, magnesium and other minerals also can cause cardiac arrest. That's most likely what happened to Mr. Beck, whose heart arteries were clear. Despite the cardiac arrest, his heart was the picture of health, Dr. Granato said.\n\nDuring a cardiac arrest, he said, all organs are deprived of oxygen for a period of minutes to a half hour. The quivering or chaotic heartbeat, known as fibrillation, must be corrected with an electrical shock via a defibrillator. Once oxygen returns to the brain, further damage can occur.\n\nClinical trials showed a 20 percent increase survival with hypothermia, Dr. Granato said. There are now calls for paramedics to use the cooling procedure in the field en route to the hospital. But an entire institution must adopt the protocol to make it successful.\n\nThe American Heart Association has approved the procedure in the wake of extensive overseas clinical trials.\n\nBut putting the therapy into practice in many hospitals has been slow.\n\nUPMC Presbyterian does about 50 hypothermic therapies a year, said Dr. Clifton Callaway, assistant professor of emergency medicine. He said a doctor at Mercy Hospital also is using the therapy on patients.\n\nOut of every 100 cardiac arrests they respond to, city paramedics succeed in getting 30 to the hospital.\n\nOf those, only seven or eight will be discharged from the hospital, he said. But that number is one or two higher than would occur without hypothermic therapy.\n\n\"We believe the people who do go home have fewer neurological problems that impair the quality of life,\" Dr. Callaway said.\n\nThe percentage increase of survival could translate nationwide into tens of thousands of saved lives each year.\n\nFor now, Dr. Callaway said, there's an upswing in hospitals using the therapy and in two years it will be more routine. City doctors who perform the therapy are collegial in promoting its use.\n\nDr. Ankur Doshi, AGH emergency medical specialist, agreed the brain-protecting therapy \"is a well-established procedure all patients should get if they are in a coma\" after a cardiac arrest.\n\nDr. Ashis Tayal, an AGH stroke neurologist, said trials are under way to use the therapy to help stroke victims. Another University of Pittsburgh Medical Center study also is using hypothermia to treat victims of head trauma. Early trials show promise in both cases.\n\nWithout the therapy, cardiac-arrest patients have a greater risk of suffering dementia, loss of memory or severe devastation of mental capacity, Dr. Tayal said.\n\nAGH doctors have used the procedure in cardiac arrest victims five times since November, and three of those patients survived the procedure. Two, including Mr. Beck, walked out of the hospital.\n\nThe third survived the initial cardiac arrest but did not survive further complications and another cardiac arrest days later.\n\nAlthough the cases are few, AGH's success rate points to the value of the therapy.\n\n\"This is not investigative,\" Dr. Tayal said. \"We consider this to be a standard of care and should be a standard of care to return people to circulation.\"\n\nWithout the procedure, Dr. Granato said, the discussion about Mr. Beck would require a more serious tone.\n\nTo prevent a future cardiac arrest, Mr. Beck had a defibrillator placed in his chest, despite a low probability of a recurrence, Dr. Granato said.\n\nMr. Beck said he didn't regain full consciousness for nine days.\n\nHe remained in the hospital for weeks in large part due to pneumonia.\n\nHe now is undergoing rehabilitation and looking forward to an April 3 checkup.\n\nHe and his wife, Fran, praised AGH for successfully returning him to normal activity without any reductions in brain power.\n\n\"My goal is to get back to a normal life,\" he said, noting he hates cold weather and is surprised he withstood hypothermic therapy.\n\n\"I can't tolerate my body being cold, but it worked,\" he said. \"It boggles my mind, really.\"\n\nAnd talk about perfect timing. He said he has many reasons to thank AGH for saving his life.\n\nOne key reason: His daughter Kirsten, 28, is due to have the Becks' first grandchild April 15.\n\nFirst published on March 28, 2007 at 12:00 am", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "While quotes from several physicans were included in this story as well as quotes from a patient who had had the treatment, the sources of the background information about the treatment and the studies about its benefit were not mentioned.

The National Institutes of Health is financing more than 50 studies testing mindfulness techniques, up from 3 in 2000, to help relieve stress, soothe addictive cravings, improve attention, lift despair and reduce hot flashes.\n\nSome proponents say Buddha\u2019s arrival in psychotherapy signals a broader opening in the culture at large \u2014 a way to access deeper healing, a hidden path revealed.\n\nYet so far, the evidence that mindfulness meditation helps relieve psychiatric symptoms is thin, and in some cases, it may make people worse, some studies suggest. Many researchers now worry that the enthusiasm for Buddhist practice will run so far ahead of the science that this promising psychological tool could turn into another fad.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very open to the possibility that this approach could be effective, and it certainly should be studied,\u201d said Scott Lilienfeld, a psychology professor at Emory. \u201cWhat concerns me is the hype, the talk about changing the world, this allure of the guru that the field of psychotherapy has a tendency to cultivate.\u201d\n\nBuddhist meditation came to psychotherapy from mainstream academic medicine. In the 1970s, a graduate student in molecular biology, Jon Kabat-Zinn, intrigued by Buddhist ideas, adapted a version of its meditative practice that could be easily learned and studied. It was by design a secular version, extracted like a gemstone from the many-layered foundation of Buddhist teaching, which has sprouted a wide variety of sects and spiritual practices and attracted 350 million adherents worldwide.\n\nIn transcendental meditation and other types of meditation, practitioners seek to transcend or \u201close\u201d themselves. The goal of mindfulness meditation was different, to foster an awareness of every sensation as it unfolds in the moment.\n\nDr. Kabat-Zinn taught the practice to people suffering from chronic pain at the University of Massachusetts medical school. In the 1980s he published a series of studies demonstrating that two-hour courses, given once a week for eight weeks, reduced chronic pain more effectively than treatment as usual.\n\nWord spread, discreetly at first. \u201cI think that back then, other researchers had to be very careful when they talked about this, because they didn\u2019t want to be seen as New Age weirdos,\u201d Dr. Kabat-Zinn, now a professor emeritus of medicine at the University of Massachusetts, said in an interview. \u201cSo they didn\u2019t call it mindfulness or meditation. \u201cAfter a while, we put enough studies out there that people became more comfortable with it.\u201d\n\nOne person who noticed early on was Marsha Linehan, a psychologist at the University of Washington who was trying to treat deeply troubled patients with histories of suicidal behavior. \u201cTrying to treat these patients with some change-based behavior therapy just made them worse, not better,\u201d Dr. Linehan said in an interview. \u201cWith the really hard stuff, you need something else, something that allows people to tolerate these very strong emotions.\u201d\n\nIn the 1990s, Dr. Linehan published a series of studies finding that a therapy that incorporated Zen Buddhist mindfulness, \u201cradical acceptance,\u201d practiced by therapist and patient significantly cut the risk of hospitalization and suicide attempts in the high-risk patients.\n\nFinally, in 2000, a group of researchers including Dr. Segal in Toronto, J. Mark G. Williams at the University of Wales and John D. Teasdale at the Medical Research Council in England published a study that found that eight weekly sessions of mindfulness halved the rate of relapse in people with three or more episodes of depression.\n\nWith Dr. Kabat-Zinn, they wrote a popular book, \u201cThe Mindful Way Through Depression.\u201d Psychotherapists\u2019 curiosity about mindfulness, once tentative, turned into \u201cthis feeding frenzy, of sorts, that we have going on now,\u201d Dr. Kabat-Zinn said.\n\nMindfulness meditation is easy to describe. Sit in a comfortable position, eyes closed, preferably with the back upright and unsupported. Relax and take note of body sensations, sounds and moods. Notice them without judgment. Let the mind settle into the rhythm of breathing. If it wanders (and it will), gently redirect attention to the breath. Stay with it for at least 10 minutes.\n\nAfter mastering control of attention, some therapists say, a person can turn, mentally, to face a threatening or troubling thought \u2014 about, say, a strained relationship with a parent \u2014 and learn simply to endure the anger or sadness and let it pass, without lapsing into rumination or trying to change the feeling, a move that often backfires.\n\nOne woman, a doctor who had been in therapy for years to manage bouts of disabling anxiety, recently began seeing Gaea Logan, a therapist in Austin, Tex., who incorporates mindfulness meditation into her practice. This patient had plenty to worry about, including a mentally ill child, a divorce and what she described as a \u201charsh internal voice,\u201d Ms. Logan said.\n\nAfter practicing mindfulness meditation, she continued to feel anxious at times but told Ms. Logan, \u201cI can stop and observe my feelings and thoughts and have compassion for myself.\u201d\n\nSteven Hayes, a psychologist at the University of Nevada at Reno, has developed a talk therapy called Acceptance Commitment Therapy, or ACT, based on a similar, Buddha-like effort to move beyond language to change fundamental psychological processes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shift from having our mental health defined by the content of our thoughts,\u201d Dr. Hayes said, \u201cto having it defined by our relationship to that content \u2014 and changing that relationship by sitting with, noticing and becoming disentangled from our definition of ourselves.\u201d\n\nFor all these hopeful signs, the science behind mindfulness is in its infancy. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which researches health practices, last year published a comprehensive review of meditation studies, including T.M., Zen and mindfulness practice, for a wide variety of physical and mental problems. The study found that over all, the research was too sketchy to draw conclusions.\n\nA recent review by Canadian researchers, focusing specifically on mindfulness meditation, concluded that it did \u201cnot have a reliable effect on depression and anxiety.\u201d\n\nTherapists who incorporate mindfulness practices do not agree when the meditation is most useful, either. Some say Buddhist meditation is most useful for patients with moderate emotional problems. Others, like Dr. Linehan, insist that patients in severe mental distress are the best candidates for mindfulness.\n\nA case in point is mindfulness-based therapy to prevent a relapse into depression. The treatment significantly reduced the risk of relapse in people who have had three or more episodes of depression. But it may have had the opposite effect on people who had one or two previous episodes, two studies suggest.\n\nThe mindfulness treatment \u201cmay be contraindicated for this group of patients,\u201d S. Helen Ma and Dr. Teasdale of the Medical Research Council concluded in a 2004 study of the therapy.\n\nSince mindfulness meditation may have different effects on different mental struggles, the challenge for its proponents will be to specify where it is most effective \u2014 and soon, given how popular the practice is becoming.\n\nThe question, said Linda Barnes, an associate professor of family medicine and pediatrics at the Boston University School of Medicine, is not whether mindfulness meditation will become a sophisticated therapeutic technique or lapse into self-help clich\u00e9.\n\n\u201cThe answer to that question is yes to both,\u201d Dr. Barnes said.\n\nThe real issue, most researchers agree, is whether the science will keep pace and help people distinguish the mindful variety from the mindless.\n\nA variety of meditative practices have been studied by Western researchers for their effects on mental and physical health.\n\nAn active exercise, sometimes called moving meditation, involving extremely slow, continuous movement and extreme concentration. The movements are to balance the vital energy of the body but have no religious significance.\n\nStudies are mixed, some finding it can reduce blood pressure in patients, and others finding no effect. There is some evidence that it can help elderly people improve balance.\n\nMeditators sit comfortably, eyes closed, and breathe naturally. They repeat and concentrate on the mantra, a word or sound chosen by the instructor to achieve state of deep, transcendent absorption. Practitioners \u201close\u201d themselves, untouched by day-to-day concerns. Studies suggest it can reduce blood pressure in some patients.\n\nPractitioners find a comfortable position, close the eyes and focus first on breathing, passively observing it. If a stray thought or emotion enters the mind, they allow it to pass and return attention to the breath. The aim is to achieve focused awareness on what is happening moment to moment.\n\nStudies find that it can help manage chronic pain. The findings are mixed on substance abuse. Two trials suggest that it can cut the rate of relapse in people who have had three or more bouts of depression.\n\nEnhanced awareness through breathing techniques and specific postures. Schools vary widely, aiming to achieve total absorption in the present and a release from ordinary thoughts.

She wanted to be screened, and she knew just what kind of screening she wanted \u2014 a test that's so new, some women and doctors don't quite realize what they've signed up for.\n\nThis kind of test , called cell free fetal DNA testing, uses a simple blood sample from an expectant mother to analyze bits of fetal DNA that have leaked into her bloodstream. It's only been on the market since October 2011 and is not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration \u2014 the FDA does not regulate this type of genetic testing service. Several companies now offer the test, including Sequenom and Illumina. Insurance coverage varies, and doctors often only offer this testing to women at higher risk because of things like advanced maternal age.\n\n\"I think that I initially heard about it through family and friends,\" says Seitz. \"They had had the option of it given to them by their doctors.\"\n\nTo her, it sounded great. She didn't want an invasive procedure like amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling.Those are considered the gold standard for prenatal genetic testing, but doctors must put a needle into the womb to collect cells that contain fetal DNA, which means a small risk of miscarriage.\n\n\"I wasn't interested in going as far as getting an amniocentesis because of the risk associated with that,\" she explains, \"and so when I heard about this test, that was part of the reason that I was most interested in it.\"\n\nThis new way of testing fetal DNA seemed to have already become fairly common where Seitz used to live, in Washington, D.C. But she had recently moved to Alabama, and the clinic she went to there wasn't as familiar with it \u2014 although when she talked to her doctor, she learned the clinic had just had a visit from a company's sales representative.\n\n\"I think it was a fairly new test for them at that point, but she was interested in pursuing it further to see what needed to be done,\" Seitz says.\n\nSeitz got her blood drawn last July, becoming one of hundreds of thousands of pregnant women who've opted for this new kind of test instead of the more traditional, invasive ones. Doctors say the impact has been huge.\n\n\"Those of us in the field who do diagnostic procedures like CVS and amnio have seen a drastic decrease in the number of those procedures that are being performed,\" says Dr. Mary Norton, an expert on maternal-fetal medicine and genetics at the University of California, San Francisco. \"Places are reporting doing fewer than half the number of procedures that were being done previously.\"\n\nBut, she says, things have changed so quickly that it may be hard for doctors and patients to know what they're dealing with.\n\n\"It's still new and it's quite different than previous genetic testing that's been available,\" says Norton. \"It's quite a different paradigm, if you will.\"\n\nAn invasive test like amniocentesis or CVS lets doctors get a complete picture of the chromosomes and a solid diagnosis.\n\nUntil the new testing technology came along, the only less invasive option was for an expectant mother to get an ultrasound, plus have her blood tested for specific proteins. This can reveal if there's an increased risk of certain disorders, but it's not very accurate and produces a lot of false alarms.\n\nStudies have shown that the new fetal DNA tests do a better job, says Norton. They're less likely to flag a normal pregnancy as high risk.\n\n\"They're much more accurate than current screening tests, but they are not diagnostic tests in the sense that amniocentesis is,\" says Norton, \"and so I think that has led to some confusion.\"\n\nEven though the newer blood tests do look at fetal DNA, they can't give a definitive answer like an amniocentesis can because they're analyzing scraps of fetal DNA in the mother's blood that are all mixed up with her own DNA.\n\nNorton says when women get worrisome results from one of these new tests and are referred to her center, they sometimes don't understand why doctors are offering a follow-up amnio \"because they were under the impression that this was as good as an amnio.\"\n\nShe is concerned that some people might end a pregnancy without getting confirmatory testing and points to one study last year that found a small number of women did that.\n\n\"There's at least some evidence that it's happening to a greater degree than I think many of us are comfortable with,\" she says.\n\nThe tests are being used more and more widely. Some worry that the companies' websites and marketing materials don't make the limitations clear enough.\n\nBut Dr. Lee Shulman doesn't see it that way. He's an obstetrician and geneticist at Northwestern University in Chicago who has consulted for a couple of the testing firms.\n\n\"Patients need to understand that while this is better, it is not a diagnostic test, and I think the companies have done a great job in putting this material out,\" he says. \"Whether or not clinicians use this material and take it to heart and use it for patient counseling is a different story.\"\n\nHe says the technology is so new that a lot of doctors have no experience with it, and consumers need to understand that.\n\n\"If the patient, if the couple, are not getting the answers, not getting the information they feel comfortable with, they need to seek out prenatal diagnostic centers, maternal fetal specialists, clinical geneticists, who may have more experience,\" says Shulman.\n\nFor example, here's one thing that might turn out to be a little more complicated than would-be parents might expect. Along with screening for the common chromosomal disorders, companies offer parents the chance to learn their baby's sex \u2014 weeks before it's clear on a sonogram.\n\n\"Many women are very excited by the idea that as part of their blood testing, they could find out pretty definitively if the baby is a boy or a girl,\" says Dr. Diana Bianchi, an expert on prenatal diagnostics at Tufts University School of Medicine.\n\nWhat they may not realize, she says, is that the test will also determine whether there's something abnormal about the sex chromosomes.\n\n\"Approximately 1 in 700 pregnancies there's an extra X or extra Y,\" she says, noting that these are mild conditions that would normally go undetected, unless a woman had an invasive test like an amnio. Some babies with these conditions grow up into adulthood and never know they have them, unless they face a symptom like infertility.\n\nSeitz, in Alabama, thought it was a bonus that getting this new blood test would tell her if she was having a boy or a girl. But it actually didn't do that, because of a paperwork glitch.\n\n\"The box for sex got unchecked somewhere along the way, so we weren't able to find it out from the test,\" says Seitz, who learned from an ultrasound that she was having a girl. The results she did get from the fetal DNA test were reassuring.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story sought out several expert sources for their opinions about the testing, and it appropriately noted that one of these sources (Dr. Lee Shulman) is a consultant to firms selling the new screening tests.

Nocturnal hot flashes are among the most problematic because they can contribute to poor sleep.\n\nA new study shows that electro-acupuncture may be effective in providing some relief. The study is being published online in Menopause, the journal of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS).\n\nCompared with women who undergo natural menopause, women with breast cancer are at a greater risk of experiencing hot flashes, partially as a result of the premature menopause that results from chemotherapy and surgery, as well as estrogen deficiency caused by the use of breast cancer treatments such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors. It is estimated that by the year 2020 there will be nearly six million breast cancer survivors in the United States.\n\nResearchers analyzed data from a randomized, controlled trial involving 58 breast cancer survivors experiencing bothersome hot flashes. They compared the benefits of using electro-acupuncture (the application of a pulsating electric current) to prescribing gabapentin, an anti-seizure medication frequently prescribed to treat sleep disturbances related to hot flashes. The study showed electro-acupuncture to be comparable to, if not better than, gabapentin in helping to reduce hot flash severity and frequency and improving overall sleep quality (including falling asleep faster and fewer sleep disruptions). Although it is not exactly understood how acupuncture affects sleep, it has been shown to affect a number of neurotransmitters associated with sleep, such as serotonin and melatonin.\n\nPoor sleep is particularly bothersome for breast cancer survivors experiencing nighttime hot flashes because it has been shown to increase levels of pain, fatigue, depression and anxiety. Although electro-acupuncture produced significant sleep improvements, researchers noted that sleep quality for the participants was still not as good as it should be, implying that more research is necessary to explore possible combinations of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments.\n\n\"This study shows that, for women who need or choose to avoid medications, electro-acupuncture may be an option because it has minimal risks, but blinded controlled trials are needed,\" says Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, NAMS executive director.\n\nFunding for the study was provided in part by a grant from the National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute Cancer Center.\n\nFounded in 1989, The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) is North America's leading nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting the health and quality of life of all women during midlife and beyond through an understanding of menopause and healthy aging.

Keeping skin healthy in the bright light of day is hard work. The devotion to hats and rash guards, the careful selection of sunscreen and thorough application and reapplication every 90 minutes is at best tedious, and when children are involved, the process can be truly demoralizing. But once the towels are hung on the line, in the soft light of dusk, your work is done. Right?\n\nA new school of thought in the beauty world is pushing the idea that what you put on your skin after a day at the beach could play a part in reducing sun damage. One proponent of the concept is Hillary Peterson, founder of Bay Area-based company True Nature Botanicals. Ms. Peterson, a former marketing executive, began to explore the use of all-natural products several years ago after surviving melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer.\n\nHer take on sun exposure is refreshingly pragmatic. \u201cThe message with\u2026protection has been to stay out of [the sun],\u201d said Ms. Peterson. \u201cBut I\u2019m on the phone with you from Hawaii and can see at least 40 people on the beach, soaking in the rays. My kids are outside playing. I know that it\u2019s not realistic to say \u2018no sun.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe is, however, quite knowledgeable about how to be safe when you\u2019re in the sun. (She\u2019s also called on Terrence Collins, the Teresa Heinz Professor of Green Chemistry at Carnegie Mellon University as a consultant to formulate her line.) Ms. Peterson has long been aware of the role that antioxidants play in protecting skin from UV damage. (A groundbreaking study in 1996 proved antioxidants like vitamins C and E can boost the efficacy of sunscreen and make skin more resistant to damage.) She even brews antioxidant-rich green tea, lets it cool and puts it in a spray bottle. \u201cI spritz my kids with it before I apply sunscreen and again after they come out of the sun,\u201d she said.\n\nNow, a new study by Yale University cancer researchers, published this year, shows that the cell-damaging effects of ultra-violet rays may continue for some time after you seek cover. Ergo, it may be necessary to draw out the day\u2019s protective ministrations into nighttime.\n\nThis information is in the early stages of transforming the category of after-sun care\u2014a category traditionally limited to aloe vera-laden moisturizers and gels that lowered the temperature of sun-parched skin but not much else. Product formulators are now seeing after-sun care as another line of defense to stop cell mutations and aging in its tracks.\n\nMs. Peterson recommends her Pacific Mist spray which contains antioxidant-rich green tea and white tea extracts as well as sea fennel extract, which aids in hydration, and the line\u2019s Pacific Face Oil which contains a mix of oils from chia seed, kiwi, passion fruit and papaya seed\u2014all rich in essential fatty acids and antioxidants.\n\nWhen shopping for other after-sun treatments, be aware that some labels only add a trace, ineffective amount of a beneficial ingredient to a product in order to tout its effects on the label, while others have a bona fide antioxidant slant.\n\nOne Love Organics, a 6-year-old company founded by ex-lawyer Suzanne LeRoux, is a fine example of the latter. Based in St. Simons Island, Ga., the brand has an Eco-Cert-certified lab that creates mostly organic, botanical-based face and body treatments developed with sun exposure in mind. Ms. LeRoux typically recommends layering the brand\u2019s Vitamin C Body Oil or the Gardenia + Tea Antioxidant Body Serum under sunscreen during the day. Rich with botanical oils and green tea extract, both are also ideal after-sun products. \u201cOur lab is on an island in the South. We think about sun exposure a lot,\u201d she added.\n\nAfter-sun care converts should also look for products dispensed in a pump or spray which keeps contents from oxidizing when exposed to air, like Blissoma\u2019s pomegranate extract-filled Amend Antioxidant Sprayable Lotion. Avoid products formulated with alcohol, which can dry skin out.\n\nNot everyone is convinced of the effectiveness of after-sun care. Beverly Hills-based dermatologist Rhonda Rand believes most products can only lower skin temperature and add moisture. \u201cThat can make sun-exposed skin feel better,\u201d she said, \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing you can do to reverse sun exposure.\u201d And while Henry Lim, president of the American Academy of Dermatology, believes that the Yale study was important, he cautions that you only have a three-hour window after sun exposure to take advantage of any potential product benefits\u2014and that antioxidants \u201care notoriously not very stable and must be formulated carefully in order to be effective.\u201d\n\nBut believers like True Nature Botanicals\u2019 Ms. Peterson are undeterred. \u201cIn medicine, you need a definitive study,\u201d she countered. \u201cWe can\u2019t get doctors to say if you eat a healthier diet, your body will function better.

Levels of NAD+ diminish with age, and it has been suggested that loss of this metabolite may play a role in age-related health decline.\n\nThese findings in animal studies have spurred people to take commercially available NR supplements designed to boost NAD+. However, these over-the-counter supplements have not undergone clinical trials to see if they work in people.\n\nThe new research, reported Oct. 10 in the journal Nature Communications, was led by Charles Brenner, PhD, professor and Roy J. Carver Chair of Biochemistry at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine in collaboration with colleagues at Queens University Belfast and ChromaDex Corp. (NASDAQ: CDXC), which supplied the NR used in the trial. Brenner is a consultant for ChromaDex. He also is co-founder and Chief Scientific Adviser of ProHealthspan, which sells NR supplements under the trade name Tru NIAGEN\u00ae.\n\nThe human trial involved six men and six women, all healthy. Each participant received single oral doses of 100 mg, 300 mg, or 1,000 mg of NR in a different sequence with a seven-day gap between doses. After each dose, blood and urine samples were collected and analyzed by Brenner's lab to measure various NAD+ metabolites in a process called metabolomics. The trial showed that the NR vitamin increased NAD+ metabolism by amounts directly related to the dose, and there were no serious side effects with any of the doses.\n\n\"This trial shows that oral NR safely boosts human NAD+ metabolism,\" Brenner says. \"We are excited because everything we are learning from animal systems indicates that the effectiveness of NR depends on preserving and/or boosting NAD+ and related compounds in the face of metabolic stresses. Because the levels of supplementation in mice that produce beneficial effects are achievable in people, it appears than health benefits of NR will be translatable to humans safely.\"\n\nThe next step will be to study the effect of longer duration NR supplementation on NAD+ metabolism in healthy adults, but Brenner also has plans to test the effects of NR in people with diseases and health conditions, including elevated cholesterol, obesity and diabetes, and people at risk for chemotherapeutic peripheral neuropathy.\n\nPrior to the formal clinical trial, Brenner conducted a pilot human study - on himself. In 2004, he had discovered that NR is a natural product found in milk and that there is pathway to convert NR to NAD+ in people. More than a decade of research on NR metabolic pathways and health effects in mice and rats had convinced him that NR supplementation had real promise to improve human health and wellness. After consulting with UI's institutional review board, he conducted an experiment in which he took 1 gram of NR once a day for seven days, and his team analyzed blood and urine samples using mass spectrometry. The experiment showed that Brenner's blood NAD+ increased by about 2.7 times. In addition, though he reported immediate sensitivity to flushing with the related compound niacin, he did not experience any side effects taking NR.\n\nThe biggest surprise from his metabolomic analysis was an increase in a metabolite called NAAD, which was multiplied by 45 times, from trace levels to amounts in the micromolar range that were easily detectable.\n\n\"While this was unexpected, I thought it might be useful,\" Brenner says. \"NAD+ is an abundant metabolite and it is sometimes hard to see the needle move on levels of abundant metabolites. But when you can look at a low-abundance metabolite that goes from undetectable to easily detectable, there is a great signal to noise ratio, meaning that NAAD levels could be a useful biomarker for tracking increases in NAD+ in human trials.\"\n\nBrenner notes this was a case of bidirectional translational science; having learned something from the initial human experiment, his team was able to return to laboratory mice to explore the unexpected NAAD finding in more detail.\n\nBrenner's mouse study showed that NAAD is formed from NR and confirmed that NAAD levels are a strong biomarker for increased NAD+ metabolism. The experiments also revealed more detail about NAD+ metabolic pathways.\n\nIn particular, the researchers compared the ability of all three NAD+ precursor vitamins - NR, niacin, and nicotinamide - to boost NAD+ metabolism and stimulate the activity of certain enzymes, which have been linked to longevity and health benefits. The study showed for the first time that oral NR is superior to nicotinamide, which is better than niacin in terms of the total amount of NAD+ produced at an equivalent dose. NR was also the best of the three in stimulating the activity of sirtuin enzymes. However, in this case, NR was the best at stimulating sirtuin-like activities, followed by niacin, followed by nicotinamide.\n\nThe information from the mouse study subsequently helped Brenner's team design the formal clinical trial. In addition to showing that NR boosts NAD+ in humans without adverse effects, the trial confirmed that NAAD is a highly sensitive biomarker of NR supplementation in people.\n\n\"Now that we have demonstrated safety in this small clinical trial, we are in a position to find out if the health benefits that we have seen in animals can be reproduced in people,\" says Brenner, who also is co-director of the Obesity Research and Education Initiative, professor of internal medicine, and a member of the Fraternal Order of Eagles Diabetes Research Center at the UI.\n\nIn addition to Brenner, the research team included lead study author Samuel Trammell, Mark Schmidt, Benjamin Weidemann, Zhonggang Li, and E.

This amount of zinc is equivalent to what biofortified crops like zinc rice and zinc wheat can add to the diet of vulnerable, nutrient deficient populations.\n\nThe study, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, was led by CHORI Senior Scientist Janet King, PhD. King and her team are the first to show that a modest increase in dietary zinc reduces oxidative stress and damage to DNA.\n\n\"We were pleasantly surprised to see that just a small increase in dietary zinc can have such a significant impact on how metabolism is carried out throughout the body,\" says King. \"These results present a new strategy for measuring the impact of zinc on health and reinforce the evidence that food-based interventions can improve micronutrient deficiencies worldwide.\"\n\nZinc is ubiquitous in our body and facilitates many functions that are essential for preserving life. It plays a vital role in maintaining optimal childhood growth, and in ensuring a healthy immune system. Zinc also helps limit inflammation and oxidative stress in our body, which are associated with the onset of chronic cardiovascular diseases and cancers.\n\nAround much of the world, many households eat polished white rice or highly refined wheat or maize flours, which provide energy but do not provide enough essential micronutrients such as zinc. Zinc is an essential part of nearly 3,000 different proteins, and it impacts how these proteins regulate every cell in our body. In the absence of sufficient zinc, our ability to repair everyday wear and tear on our DNA is compromised.\n\nIn the randomized, controlled, six-week study the scientists measured the impact of zinc on human metabolism by counting DNA strand breaks. They used the parameter of DNA damage to examine the influence of a moderate amount of zinc on healthy living. This was a novel approach, different from the commonly used method of looking at zinc in the blood or using stunting and morbidity for assessing zinc status.\n\nAccording to King, these results are relevant to the planning and evaluation of food-based solutions for mitigating the impact of hidden hunger and malnutrition.

Patients in the trial, whose blood sugar levels have remained near normal for five to eight years, take about one-third less insulin than they did before, reducing their risk of hypoglycemia, in which insulin lowers blood sugar to dangerously low levels.\n\nThe experimental treatment, a decades-old generic vaccine for tuberculosis called bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), seems to alter both cellular metabolism and the immune system, said Dr. Denise Faustman of Massachusetts General Hospital, senior author of the study published Thursday in npj Vaccines. \u201cThis cheap, old vaccine is lowering blood sugar to levels never achieved before,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile the results, from only nine patients, must be replicated in a larger study, said Dr. Joseph Bellanti of Georgetown University Medical Center, \u201cif what they found is true, they really have something here.\u201d Bellanti, who was not involved in the research, said the study\u2019s eight-year follow-up and use of a placebo control arm made him \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that two doses of the BCG vaccine \u201ccan decrease levels of A1c,\u201d a measure of blood glucose that predicts the likelihood of serious complications such as stroke and kidney failure.\n\nJDRF (formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation), the Joslin Diabetes Center, and several university diabetes centers all declined to speak about Faustman\u2019s results.

After the vaccine showed signs of effectiveness, an additional six patients were vaccinated five years ago, and 111 more recently. The new paper and a presentation scheduled for a meeting of the American Diabetes Association this weekend focus on the patients who have been followed for more than five years.\n\nAll of those patients who received BCG had a statistically significant change in hemoglobin A1c. A normal level is below 6. In the vaccinated patients, A1c levels fell from an average of 7.36 before the first dose to 6.18 after five years, holding almost steady at 6.65 in the eighth year. In patients receiving a sham injection, levels showed almost no change from their initial levels of 7.10: 7.07 in the fifth year and 7.22 in the eighth.\n\n\u201cWe wanted it to be good, but we didn\u2019t know it would be this good,\u201d Faustman said.\n\nAll of the patients remain on insulin, she said, but less of it. They are also able to monitor their blood sugar less frequently, which can be several times an hour. (The standard of care is a continuous glucose monitor, in which a probe is inserted into the abdomen, plus an insulin pump.) \u201cIf we can gradually move people to where they can control their blood sugar, their minute-to-minute lifestyle can improve dramatically,\u201d Faustman said.\n\nThe A1c reductions could also bring significant health benefits. Every 10 percent drop, research shows, reduces complications such as stroke and heart attack by about one-third. The BCG vaccine lowered A1c levels 9 percent to 16 percent.\n\nThe new paper describes how the BCG vaccine, which has been used for nearly 100 years against tuberculosis and is considered extremely safe, might affect diabetes. According to studies in mice, it has two effects. It alters the immune system so as to increase levels of T regulatory cells; T regs keep other immune cells in check, including those that attack the pancreas\u2019s insulin-making cells \u2014 the root cause of type 1 diabetes.

Previous research involved administering the combination by injection or via a patch, said study senior author Dr. Christina Wang, a professor of medicine at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute.\n\nThe combination contraceptive needs to undergo further testing before it is commercially available.\n\nAlthough men have sometimes received a bad rap for not being willing to assume responsibility for birth control, Dr. Joseph Alukal, an assistant professor of urology at NYU Langone Medical Center, in New York City, thinks this reputation may be somewhat undeserved.\n\n\"I think [men] would use it more than is realized,\" said Alukal, who was not involved in the new research. \"Plenty of guys are concerned about unwanted pregnancy, almost as much as women.\"\n\nUnfortunately, condoms and vasectomy have remained the only commercially available contraception options for men.\n\nThe results of the study, funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development, were presented at the recent Endocrine Society annual meeting, held in Houston.\n\nAccording to Wang, the gel was applied in two spots -- the testosterone component on the arm and the progestin component on the abdomen.

Some are so new, clinical trials are still testing their efficacy and safety for human use.\n\nThese trials form the basis of the Cambridge research that was published Tuesday in the journal Molecular Psychiatry\n\nBased on previous findings about depression, the team looked at the side effects experienced by patients given anti-cytokine drugs in 20 separate studies. All the participants had chronic autoimmune inflammatory diseases, which occur when healthy cells are mistaken for infected cells, causing the immune system to attack the body and leading to inflammation.\n\nAnti-cytokine drugs \"dampen down inflammation by blocking the actions of specific inflammatory cytokines ... with 'surgical precision' and are now routinely used for treating patients who respond inadequately to standard treatments for inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and Crohn's disease both in the US and Europe,\" explained Dr. Golam Khandaker, a clinical lecturer in Cambridge's department of psychiatry and lead author of the new study.\n\nUsing data from the 20 studies, Khandaker and his colleagues found that anti-cytokine drugs improved symptoms of depression, regardless of whether they lessened the symptoms of physical illness.\n\n\"The findings suggest that inflammation may contribute to the pathogenesis of depression,\" Khandaker said. The findings also suggest that \"anti-inflammatory drugs may be helpful in treating patients with depression who are chronically inflamed.\"\n\nThe immune system acts like a thermostat, turned down low most of the time but cranked up when we have an infection, according to Khandaker. In some people, the thermostat is always set slightly higher, behaving as if they have a persistent low-level infection.\n\nFor the current report, Khandaker and his colleagues looked at studies of drugs blocking specific cytokines.\n\nKhandaker said that five of the 20 studies focused on one specific cytokine. All five showed the same result, that blocking the action of this cytokine to reduce inflammation lessened symptoms of depression.\n\nTwo clinical trials examined by Khandaker focused on another drug blocking the action of a different cytokine, and both studies showed it improved symptoms of depression.\n\nLooking to the future\n\n\"Evidence at this point suggests that cytokine antagonists -- which are much more specific in their anti-inflammatory effects than drugs like aspirin -- show modest antidepressant effects in individuals with depression and increased inflammation,\" said Raison, who did not participate in in Khandaker's research.\n\nThough it's still too early to prescribe these drugs to depressed patients, Khandaker believes that anti-inflammatory drugs may offer hope to people who find current antidepressants ineffective.\n\n\"We need more studies,\" he said, particularly research involving patients with depression who are inflamed but healthy to investigate the effect of these drugs on depression.

The treatment involved an electromagnetic coil placed over the left side of the brain that transmitted pulses of electrical currents.\n\nSimilar types of stimulation treatment are used in some patients with depression or during spinal surgery, according to Barrett.

McEvoy, MD, MCR, and her co-authors report that at three months of age, the infants whose mothers took 500 mg of vitamin C in addition to their prenatal vitamin had significantly better forced expiratory flows (FEFs). FEFs measure how fast air can be exhaled from the lung and are an important measure of lung function because they can detect airway obstruction.\n\nThe researchers also discovered an association between the infant FEFs and a genetic variant some of the mothers possessed that appeared to amplify the negative impact of nicotine on the babies before they were born. Other studies have linked this genetic factor, specifically for the \u03b15 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, to increased risk of lung cancer and obstructive lung disease.\n\n\u201cSmoking during pregnancy reflects the highly addictive nature of nicotine that disproportionately affects the most vulnerable populations,\u201d said Dr. McEvoy, lead study author and professor of pediatrics at Oregon Health & Science University. \u201cFinding a way to help infants exposed to smoking and nicotine in utero recognizes the unique dangers posed by a highly advertised, addictive product and the lifetime effects on offspring who did not choose to be exposed.\u201d\n\nIn a previous study, the authors had shown that 72 hours after birth, babies of mothers who smoked had better lung function if their mothers were randomized to vitamin C (500 mg/day) during their pregnancies compared to those born to mothers who smoked and were randomized to placebo. That study used passive methods to measure lung function, and the authors note that FEFs provide a more direct assessment of airway function and are similar to methods used to diagnose lung disease in adults and older children.\n\nIn the current study, 251 pregnant women who smoked were randomly assigned at 13 to 23 weeks of gestation to either receive vitamin C (125 women) or a placebo (126 women). Smoking was defined as having had one or more cigarettes in the last week. All participants received smoking cessation counseling throughout the study, and about 10 percent of the women quit smoking during the study.\n\nThe researchers wrote that study results support the hypothesis that oxidative stress caused by cigarette smoking reduces the amount of ascorbic acid, a component of vitamin C, available to the body. At the time they enrolled in the study, the women had lower levels of ascorbic acid than have been reported among women who do not smoke. Those levels rose in study participants who received vitamin C to become comparable to women who do not smoke.\n\nInfants in this study will continue to be followed to track their lung function and respiratory outcomes. The authors believe that future trials of vitamin C supplementation in pregnant smokers should determine whether the benefits are greater if the supplementation starts earlier and continues postnatally in the babies themselves.\n\nSumming up the findings of the current study, Dr. McEvoy said that a relatively low dosage of vitamin C may present \u201ca safe and inexpensive intervention that has the potential to help lung health of millions of infants worldwide.\u201d\n\nHowever, she added, helping mothers quit smoking should remain the primary goal for health professionals and public health officials. \u201cAlthough vitamin C supplementation may protect to some extent the lungs of babies born to mothers who smoke during pregnancy, those children will still be at greater risk for obesity, behavioral disorders and other serious health issues,\u201d she said.\n\nThis study was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the Office of Dietary Supplements.\n\n\u201cFor mothers who smoke during pregnancy, vitamin C may reduce harm #smoking causes to their babies\u2019 #lungs, finds new study of #vitaminC supplementation. #Nosmokingduringpregnancy.\u201d\n\nAbout the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine\n\nThe AJRCCM is a peer-reviewed journal published by the American Thoracic Society.

Bipolar disorder often is misdiagnosed as major depression. But while the symptoms of the depressive phase of bipolar disorder are similar to that of major depression, the treatments are different and often challenging for the physician. In bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, a patient swings between an emotional high (manic episode) and severe depression. Treatment for the depressed phase includes an antidepressant along with a safeguard such as a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic drug to prevent a switch to a manic episode. A physician who misdiagnoses bipolar disorder as major depression could inadvertently trigger a manic episode by prescribing an antidepressant without a safeguard mood stabilizing drug. The study found that heart rate variability, as measured by an electrocardiogram, indicated whether subjects had major depression or bipolar disorder. (Heart rate variability is a variation in the time interval between heartbeats.) The study, by senior author Angelos Halaris, MD, PhD and colleagues, was published in the World Journal of Biological Psychiatry. \"Having a noninvasive, easy-to-use and affordable test to differentiate between major depression and bipolar disorder would be a major breakthrough in both psychiatric and primary care practices,\" Dr. Halaris said. Dr. Halaris said further research is needed to confirm the study\u2019s findings and determine their clinical significance. Dr. Halaris is a professor in Loyola's department of psychiatry and behavioral neurosciences and medical director of adult psychiatry. Major depression is among the most common and severe health problems in the world. In the United States, at least 8 to 10 percent of the population suffers from major depression at any given time. While less common than major depression, bipolar disorder is a significant mental health problem, affecting an estimated 50 million people worldwide. The Loyola study enrolled 64 adults with major depression and 37 adults with bipolar disorder. All subjects underwent electrocardiograms at the start of the study. Each participant rested comfortably on an exam table while a three-lead electrocardiogram was attached to the chest. After the patient rested for 15 minutes, the electrocardiographic data were collected for 15 minutes. Using a special software package, researchers converted the electrocardiographic data into the components of heart rate variability. These data were further corrected with specialized software programs developed by study co-author Stephen W. Porges, PhD, of Indiana University's Kinsey Institute. In measuring heart rate variability, researchers computed what is known to cardiologists as respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). At the baseline (beginning of the study), the subjects with major depression had significantly higher RSA than those with bipolar disorder. In a secondary finding, researchers found that patients with bipolar disorder had higher blood levels of inflammation biomarkers than patients with major depression. Inflammation occurs when the immune system revs up in response to a stressful condition such as bipolar disorder. The study is titled \"Low cardiac vagal tone index by heart rate variability differentiates bipolar from major depression.\" In addition to Drs.

Tinny traditional music might be playing from a battery-run cassette player. The seniors are focused and at ease in their daily ritual, and it's soothing to watch them.\n\nThe movement is tai chi, an ancient martial art turned exercise, and a study out this week in Archives of Internal Medicine says it may help people suffering from heart failure feel better about life. In a quality of life questionnaire the researchers gave out, those who practiced tai chi scored significantly higher than those who hadn't been doing the movement. The tai chi group also reported an improvement in mood.\n\nHeart failure is a tough disease to live with; the shortness of breath and low energy that can come because the heart can't pump enough blood make physical activity unappealing. \"Historically, patients with chronic systolic heart failure were considered too frail to exercise and, through the late 1980s, avoidance of physical activity was a standard recommendation,\" the study's authors write.\n\nThe Chinese developed tai chi thousands of years ago, but it has recently piqued the interest of Western medicine as an alternative mind-body therapy to treat disease. According to a Harvard Medical School newsletter, tai chi is increasingly seen as a form of 'medication in motion.'\n\nIt's been shown to be useful in treating a wide range of diseases from breast cancer to Parkinson's. The National Institutes of Health has also jumped on board and is funding a variety of studies on tai chi for chronic disease.\n\nThe Archives of Internal Medicine study is the first large clinical trial to look at whether a tai chi program can do anything for people with heart failure. The researchers recruited 100 people with the chronic condition from heart clinics in Boston. About half were randomly assigned to receive a 12-week tai chi exercise program. The other half got a heart health education program.\n\nThe tai chi program started off with some traditional warm-up exercises of arm swinging, gentle stretches, breathing, and visualization techniques. Then patients learned five simple movements designed to release tension in the body, increase awareness of breathing, and relax the body and mind. Patients got an instructional video tape, and were encouraged to practice at home at least 3 times a week.\n\nThe study authors say there's a usually a strong relationship between depression and heart failure, so the fact that tai chi helped cheer people up was an especially good sign.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "There were no independent perspectives provided in the story.

While both drugs reduced cases of breast cancer by about half from what would have been expected for the women in the study, raloxifene caused fewer cases of blood clots, cataracts and uterine cancers, making it initially appear the winner.\n\nBut raloxifene's edge in blood-clot and uterine-cancer avoidance was not statistically significant, and tamoxifen proved better at reducing the rate of noninvasive breast cancer. So, in response to the cancer institute's announcement two months ago, some experts quickly declared that raloxifene was not clearly superior, leaving women in a quandary.\n\nTamoxifen, a generic drug, is already approved for reducing the risk of breast cancer. Raloxifene, sold by Eli Lilly & Company under the name Evista, is now approved only to prevent bone-thinning.\n\nThe new information presented here and published in the medical journal included a detailed analysis of the side effects of the drugs and the results of a survey of about 10 percent of the 19,747 women in the trial concerning their physical and mental well-being.\n\nThere was no overall difference between the drugs in the women's self-rated physical health, mental health or depression. But hot flashes, vaginal bleeding, bladder control problems and leg cramps were more common in the women who took tamoxifen, while pain during sexual intercourse and joint pain were more common in the raloxifene group.\n\nThe new data are not likely to settle the debate about which drug is better. \"Although media coverage of the early release of data from the STAR trial suggests a clear 'winner' in raloxifene, the data from clinical endpoints and patient-reported symptoms suggest a less clear conclusion,\" Dr. William J. Gradishar and David Cella of Northwestern University wrote in an editorial in the medical journal.\n\nDr. Patricia A. Ganz of the University of California, Los Angeles, who presented the quality-of-life data here, said decisions should be made based on each woman's circumstances. If a woman is worried about uterine cancer, she might use raloxifene, Dr. Ganz said. If an active sex life is important to her, a woman might prefer tamoxifen.\n\nBut Dr. Ganz said that side effects of both drugs were generally mild and that it was important that women at high risk of breast cancer take one of them.\n\nRelatively few women at high risk of breast cancer take tamoxifen, and some patient advocates question whether they should, saying many women are exposed to side effects for each case of cancer prevented.\n\nThe editorial in the journal said the new data \"still may not be enough to convince primary care physicians to be more aggressive than they have been to date in breast cancer chemoprevention.\"\n\nAs for the data on vaginal and vulvar cancer prevention, they came from combining data from three trials used to test the ability of the vaccine, Gardasil, made by Merck & Company, to prevent cervical cancer.

That made the vaccine 81 percent effective, said Dr. Jorma Paavonen of the University of Helsinki, the lead author.\n\nWhen the researchers looked only at lesions caused by the particular viral strains in the vaccine, they found no cases in the vaccinated group and 24 in the placebo group.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story cites information from both the editorial that accompanied these studies as well as the researcher who presented the results at a professional meeting.

Physicians say the test is accurate and the most comprehensive available, but some say its long processing time limits usefulness in emergency rooms.\n\nDoctors currently diagnose colds and flus through a patchwork of testing, observation and process of elimination. But many of the current tests available are not very sensitive, and most test for only one or two viruses at a time. According to a 2006 study in the New England Journal of Medicine of some 3,000 children under 5 years old, only 17% who had the flu were properly diagnosed in doctors' offices, clinics and emergency rooms. Poor diagnosis can result in a missed opportunity to prescribe a flu medicine, and also sometimes results in an unneeded antibiotic if doctors wrongly think the illness is caused by bacteria.\n\nThe new test, called the xTAG respiratory panel, approved earlier this year by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, is the most comprehensive FDA-approved virus-panel to date. It tests for a dozen viruses, including several types of influenza, two types of respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, three types of parainfluenza, adenovirus and even rhinovirus, which causes the common cold. According to manufacturer Luminex Corp. , Austin, Texas, the viruses in the panel are expected to account for about 85% of the viral illnesses in the U.S. this year.\n\nThe test is expected to be used mainly in hospitals and emergency rooms, but doctors can send the swab to a local lab.\n\nTo use it, doctors take a swab from the nose or throat. In the lab, genetic material from the swab is magnified millions of times and then bound to fluorescent markers, which are then read by a machine. According to data submitted to the FDA, the test detects each virus 78% to 100% of the time, depending on the type, and has few false positives. For example, the FDA-submitted data say it detects RSV, a common cause of infant pneumonia, 100% of the time, while giving false positives 2% of the time.\n\n\"This is really the gold standard. It is very sensitive,\" says Kathryn M. Edwards, a Nashville pediatric infectious-disease specialist and co-author of the New England Journal study.\n\nThe downside is that the test is expensive, about $300 to $400, but is covered by most insurers. It also needs extensive processing in the lab. And patients will have to wait at least six to seven hours -- maybe a day or two depending on staffing at the hospital laboratory. \"Emergency departments are going to have to think twice about a test like that,\" says Michael Shannon, senior physician in emergency medicine at Children's Hospital Boston.

Topical treatments are available for superficial basal cell carcinoma (BCC) but there has a lack of long-term follow-up data to guide treatment decisions. A three-year randomized controlled clinical trial has found that two topical creams are effective in most primary, low-risk superficial BCC, comparing favorably with photodynamic therapy (PDT), as reported by investigators in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology.\n\nMore than 80% of all skin cancers are BCC, arising from the basal cells (i.e., small, round cells found in the lower layer of the epidermis). There are over two million cases a year in the U.S. and the lifetime risk of developing a BCC before the age of 85 years is one in five people. The prognosis is excellent, but it can cause significant disfigurement by invading surrounding tissues.\n\nWhile most types of BCC require surgery, superficial BCC can be treated topically with noninvasive treatments such as PDT, imiquimod cream, fluorouracil cream, cryosurgery or electrodessication and curettage.\n\nInvestigators in the Netherlands report the results of a three-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial that compared three noninvasive treatments that included imiquimod and fluorouracil cream. \"The main advantages of noninvasive treatments are good cosmetic outcome, preservation of surrounding tissue, and potential for home application of either creams,\" explained lead investigator Marieke Roozeboom of the Department of Dermatology, Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands. \"Throughout the last two decades there has been a growing interest in these non-surgical therapies, which offer the possibility of avoiding surgery and reducing demands on busy medical practices.\"\n\nHowever, prior to this study there has been a lack of randomized controlled trials with a long-term follow-up that compare the effectiveness of noninvasive treatments. Consequently, there is no consensus in international BCC guidelines on the first choice of noninvasive therapy for superficial BCC.\n\nA total of 601 patients with a superficial BCC participated in this study: 202 patients were treated with methylaminolevulinate photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT), 198 with imiquimod cream, and 201 with fluorouracil cream. The three study groups had a similar distribution of baseline characteristics, with the exception of tumor size.\n\nAround 80% of patients with superficial BCC were tumor free after imiquimod treatment after three years. The clearance rate was 68% for patients treated with fluorouracil and 58% for individuals receiving PDT.\n\n\"Based on our findings, both imiquimod and fluorouracil are effective noninvasive treatments in most primary, low-risk superficial BCC, but the data provide no definite evidence for superiority of imiquimod to fluorouracil,\" commented Dr. Roozeboom. \"Both creams have an equal cosmetic outcome and risk of local adverse events. Fluorouracil has the advantage of being less expensive than imiquimod. However, between one- and three-year follow-up, more recurrences were diagnosed in the fluorouracil group compared with the imiquimod group.\"\n\n\"When choosing a treatment for an individual patient with a superficial BCC, other factors like age, compliance, and patient preferences should always be taken into account. For example, we have found that in superficial BCC on the lower extremities in older patients, PDT should be prescribed rather than imiquimod. Our evidence indicates that a personalized treatment approach is necessary,\" added Dr. Roozeboom.\n\n\"Three year follow-up results of photodynamic therapy versus imiquimod versus fluorouracil for treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma: a single blind, noninferiority, randomized controlled trial,\" by Marieke H.

The team used this opportunity to see how stimulating the brain affects memory.\n\nThey focused on an area of the brain called the entorhinal cortex, which helps form and store memories.\n\n\u201cThe entorhinal cortex is the golden gate to the brain\u2019s memory mainframe,\u201d Dr. Itzhak Fried, professor of neurosurgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, who worked on the study, said in a telephone interview. The research was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nFried said sensory experiences that eventually become memories pass through this hub before they are stored in the hippocampus, the brain\u2019s chief memory center.\n\nFor the study, patients played a video game in which they had to shuttle people around in taxis to different shops in a virtual city. The team tested whether stimulating the entorhinal cortex or the hippocampus while they were learning their way around the city improved their recall.\n\n\u201cWhen we stimulated the hippocampus itself, there was not an effect. It was really stimulation in the gateway to the hippocampus - the entorhinal cortex - where we got the beneficial effect in terms of memory,\u201d Fried said.\n\nCompared to testing before stimulation, zapping this part of the brain helped people recognize landmarks and navigate the virtual city more quickly. Fried said the findings suggest stimulating the brain just as memories are forming is key.\n\nIn Alzheimer\u2019s disease, this area of the brain is affected early on, when signs of dementia begin to appear.\n\nFried said the study might have implications for treatments for patients with early Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but he cautioned that the results are very preliminary.\n\n\u201cThe question would be whether this can help memory in patients with memory impairments,\u201d he said. Scientists are increasingly focused on ways to treat the memory-robbing disease, which affects more than 5 million Americans.\n\nDespite costly efforts, no drug has been found that can keep Alzheimer\u2019s from progressing, and policymakers are growing increasingly worried about the swelling ranks of dementia patients as the population ages.\n\nSuzanne Haber, a neuroscientist at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York who was not involved in the study, said she was \u201cvery excited about the finding,\u201d but she cautioned that the treatment is very invasive, very expensive and unproven in Alzheimer\u2019s patients.\n\nThe Obama administration said on Wednesday it plans to spend an additional $156 million over the next two years to help find an effective treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nOne team has already tried deep brain stimulation in Alzheimer\u2019s patients. In a study published in the Annals of Neurology in 2010 researchers tested deep brain stimulation in six patients over the course of a year and found the treatment to be relatively safe.

They\u2019re found naturally in some foods but are often manufactured and added to processed foods to improve taste and texture.\n\n\u201cNew York City was progressive and they enacted restrictions on trans fats, but no one looked to see if this made measurable changes to outcomes,\u201d said study lead author Dr. Eric Brandt, of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nNew York City limited the use of trans fats starting in July 2007. The restrictions applied to food purchased outside of stores, such as at restaurants, street vendors and bakeries, in the city\u2019s five counties. Other New York counties took similar actions after New York City\u2019s measure was enacted.\n\nPrevious research found that death from cardiovascular disease declined 4.5 percent within a year after counties enacted trans fat restrictions, the researchers write in JAMA Cardiology. No study looked at non-fatal cardiovascular issues like hospitalizations due to heart attacks and strokes, however.\n\nFor the new study, the researchers compared data on people hospitalized between 2002 and 2013 for heart attacks or strokes in counties that did or didn\u2019t restrict trans fats.\n\nAltogether they had data on 3.3 million people in 25 counties without trans fat restrictions and 8.4 million people in 11 counties with restrictions.\n\nIn 2006, there were 753 hospital admissions for heart attack or stroke per 100,000 people in counties that never enacted restrictions compared to 726 per 100,000 people in counties that put restrictions in place.\n\nWhile admissions for heart attacks and strokes fell after 2002 in all the counties, the drop was more substantial in those that enacted trans fat restrictions, the authors found.\n\nAfter three years or more, the combined rate of hospitalizations for heart attacks or strokes was about 6 percent lower in the counties with trans fat regulations.\n\nAdmissions for heart attacks were nearly 8 percent lower in counties with restrictions. Similarly, admissions for strokes were about 4 percent lower in counties with restrictions, but that finding could be due to chance.\n\nBrandt told Reuters Health that New York City was also pushing other public health initiatives around the same time.

Why, Dr. Anderson asked the company executives, couldn\u2019t there be a polymer to put on skin?\n\n\u201cA lot of what happens when we age and skin starts wrinkling and sagging is loss of elastic recoil,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we move skin, it doesn\u2019t snap back to what it used to be.\u201d\n\nWhat if there was a way to restore the elastic nature of skin?\n\nDr. Anderson listed what would be needed: \u201cIt has to be nearly invisible.

Scientists discovered low doses of its main psychoactive ingredient\u2014cannabinoid THC\u2014can reverse the age-related decline in cognitive abilities, a finding that could lead to scientists figuring out a way of slowing brain aging in humans.\n\nResearchers are increasingly examining THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) for its potential medical benefits. In the U.K., Oxford University recently launched a \u00a310 million ($13 million) program to \u201cidentify new medical therapies through research into the molecular, cellular and systems mechanisms of cannabinoids.\u201d Meanwhile, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has now approved several medications derived from THC.\n\nMany scientists are currently looking at its potential use as a treatment for neurological conditions, including multiple sclerosis, epilepsy and Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nIn a study published in Nature Medicine on Monday, researchers led by Andreas Zimmer, from the University of Bonn, Germany, have shown how THC can provide significant benefits to mice when it comes to age-related cognitive decline.\n\nTHC interacts with receptors in the brain\u2019s endocannabinoid system, which is involved in many physiological functions, including pain, mood, memory and appetite. Previous research has also shown activity in the endocannabinoid system declines as we get older, indicating it plays a role in the progression of aging.\n\nTo study what effect THC has on the aging brain, scientists gave low doses of THC to mice at three different life stages\u2014two months, 12 months and 18 months. The latter two groups represented mature and old age.\n\nThe team carried out three experiments. The first involved a water maze, where mice have to learn and then remember how to navigate their way to the end. In a control group, mature and old mice performed worse than the young group. However, when treated with THC, the older groups improved at the task, while the young mice fared far worse. (The study\u2019s authors noted that this was in \u201cgood agreement with the known detrimental effects of THC on cognition in young animals and humans.\u201d\n\nNext, they created a task where mice had to locate a specific object. Older mice treated with THC performed to the same standard as young mice that had not been given the drug. A third test relating to partner recognition also showed THC led to improved memory in mature and older mice. \u201cTogether, these results reveal a profound, long-lasting improvement of cognitive performance resulting from a low dose of THC treatment in mature and old animals,\u201d the scientists write.\n\nFurther research showed what might cause the improvement, with THC appearing to restore hippocampal gene transcription patterns\u2014activity in the brain relating to memory and learning\u2014to a similar state seen in young mice.\n\nThe team argues that while they do not yet know if these findings would be same in humans, it could lead to new treatments to prevent cognitive decline in older people: \u201cCannabis preparations and THC are used for medicinal purposes,\u201d they write. \u201cThey have an excellent safety record and do not produce adverse side-effects when administered at a low dose to older individuals. Thus, chronic, low-dose treatment with THC or cannabis extracts could be a potential strategy to slow down or even to reverse cognitive decline in the elderly.\u201d\n\nZameel Cader, associate professor in clinical neurosciences at Oxford University, is involved in the institution\u2019s $13 million cannabis research project. Commenting on the Nature Medicine study, he tells Newsweek the paper is \u201cvery interesting on a number of levels.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst of all there\u2019s clearly growing interest in the potential therapeutic role of cannabinoids and in this particular case THC on various human conditions,\u201d he says. \u201cThis paper is addressing a possible role for that compound in memory and cognition, which is relevant to disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s and other dementias.\u201d\n\nHe said that while it is important to remember the study was carried out on mouse models, the differences in the effect of the drug on younger animals versus older animals tells us a lot about our understanding of the differences between old and young brains.\n\nMoving this research forward, however, will be problematic: \u201cTesting in humans is going to be difficult. This is a challenge faced by anyone wanting to develop a therapy for a human disorder such as dementia. Human lifespan is very extensive. So the question would be, when would be the most appropriate time to give these kinds of medications? Over what period of time do you need to evaluate the effects? In humans it could be years before an effect is noticed.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinally, there is the issue surrounding safety. With a cannabinoid like THC, which does have adverse effects in certain individuals, there would be worries about the chronic dosing of this kind of medicine. We would need to assess the safety first before going into seeing whether it would improve cognition.\"", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Although the outside principal source of commentary is an Oxford University scientist with skin in the game of cannabis research, his words are\u00a0temperate and cautionary about any eventual therapeutic use of cannabinoids to duplicate the mouse finds in people.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Hopes that a diet low in fat and chock-full of fruit and vegetables might prevent the return of breast cancer have been dashed by a seven-year experiment in more than 3,000 women.\n\nThe government study found no benefit from a mega-veggie-and-fruit diet over the U.S. recommended serving of five fruits and vegetables a day -- more than most Americans eat.\n\nResearchers noted that none of the breast cancer survivors lost weight on either diet.

This morning, she'll be getting two of them drilled the old-fashioned way. But the third is a decay that is not so advanced, and Dr. Jin-Ho Phark, her dentist, is going to use a treatment he's testing that involves no drilling -- \"which is nice because many patients don't like the sound of the drill, and the feeling or the pain that might be associated with it,\" Phark says.\n\nThat cringe-worthy sound may be on the way out. A new procedure used by Phark and other doctors claims to stop the progress of cavities without drills or Novocain.\n\nThe treatment, called Icon, is one of several new cavity treatments that avoid drilling. Icon was developed in Germany and has been available in the U.S. for just over a year. It's intended for patients whose decay has not gone beyond the tooth enamel.\n\nTo Drill Or Not To Drill\n\nPhark says that when decay is caught very early or very late, dentists have a clear course of action: Early problems can often be reversed with better brushing, fluoride or calcium-containing toothpastes -- and late-stage cavities need to be filled. But at the intermediate stages, dentists don't have many options.\n\n\"In many of those cases we decide, 'OK, this lesion is too small to be treated with a filling.' So, we are actually waiting until the lesion grows bigger and bigger and becomes deep enough and worthy to be drilled out and be filled,\" Phark says.\n\nGerman researcher Sebastian Paris is a dentist and one of the drill-less cavity treatment's developers.\n\n\"We aim to treat these intermediate lesions -- not the very early ones, but the intermediate ones -- where usually, as a dentist, you are not sure whether you should make a filling or not,\" Paris says.\n\nWhen tooth decay begins, minerals, like calcium, are leached out of the tooth enamel, leaving behind sponge-like pores in the enamel. If the decay process is allowed to continue, the pores grow and form a hole, known as a cavity.\n\nThe new treatment uses a coating of mild acid that is applied to the decay to open up a route to the pores and clear out decayed enamel. Then the open pores are filled with a clear resin.\n\nParis says the key to getting the treatment to work was finding a filling material that wasn't thick and goopy so the porous enamel would immediately suck it up like a sponge.\n\n\"When you take a sugar cube and you put it into your coffee, you will see that it is soaked up with the coffee,\" Paris says. \"But if you put your sugar cube into honey, you can imagine that it will take ages to soak into the sugar cube.\"\n\nAvoiding the drill has the advantage of preserving and extending the life of the natural tooth. However, some dentists argue that any time before a cavity actually forms, tooth decay can be stopped -- and even reversed -- by the patients themselves, using, for example, fluoride toothpaste.\n\n\"An alternative could simply be brushing better in a certain location and not drinking Coca-Cola all day long,\" says Mark Wolff, a professor of dentistry at New York University who specializes in cariology, or the study of tooth decay.\n\nWolff says that while the no-drill approach to treating this type of tooth decay has promise, fluoride treatments and other patient-applied methods are still more inexpensive, less invasive and have a much longer track record of success.\n\n\"Might this be a good application to help that person recover or prevent this decay from advancing? Absolutely. I think the jury is still out on the product a little bit. Hopefully it works. It's just still in its earliest stages,\" Wolff says.\n\nBecause it's so new, it's still unclear how the Icon resin filling holds up over time. And clinical studies have shown that the treatment fails to stop decay from advancing up to 15 percent of the time.\n\nBut Wolff says that for patients who aren't able or willing to change their dental hygiene habits, or who are predisposed to tooth decay, this may be a good solution for keeping the dentist's drill at bay.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "\n\n\n \nAlthough this story includes comments from an independent source and it identifies the lead researcher as being on of the product\u2019s developers\u2026 it fails to point out that the dentist featured in the story also has received financial support from product\u2019s manufacturer.\nReference: http://www.compendiumlive.com/print.php?id=3103", "answer": 0}, {"article": "For the first time in many years, John Elder Robison entered a sixth-floor lab at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and settled into a chair. He was there to demonstrate \u2014 although not actually repeat \u2014 a procedure known as transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, in which electromagnetic impulses are fired into carefully targeted areas of a patient\u2019s brain. TMS activates neurological pathways and is most commonly used to treat depression.\n\nRobison, 58, is autistic. At age 40, the Amherst resident was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s syndrome, a developmental disorder marked by impaired social skills and difficulty with nonverbal communication. Although highly competent in fields like electronics, sound design, and car mechanics, Robison found his limited ability to read body language and other unspoken cues left him feeling cut off from normal human interaction.\n\nBeginning in 2008, Robison voluntarily underwent roughly a dozen TMS sessions as part of a research study conducted at BIDMC\u2019s Berenson-Allen Center for Noninvasive Brain Stimulation. The results are chronicled in Robison\u2019s new book, \u201cSwitched On: A Memoir of Brain Change and Emotional Awakening.\u201d\n\nIn a moving, often harrowing narrative reminiscent of \u201cAwakenings\u201d and other popular works by the late neurologist and writer Oliver Sacks, Robison writes of the transformations these sessions helped unlock, the welcome ones \u2014 and the not so welcome.\n\nAfter his initial TMS session, Robison experienced music on a visceral level he had once known, long ago, but sensed he had lost. He burst into tears. \u201cThe experience was richer and deeper, with an added layer of feeling,\u201d he writes. \u201cPerhaps I was hearing music pure and true, without the distorting lens of autism.\u201d\n\nOther striking changes in perception and mood soon followed. Some proved transitory, others seemingly more permanent.\n\n\u201cThe change in my ability to relate to people is really, really big,\u201d he said during an interview in a hospital conference room.\n\nHis book is likely to spark even greater interest \u2014 and funding \u2014 in TMS as a non-medicinal way to treat symptoms associated with disabilities like autism, epilepsy, ADHD, and dementia. Robison certainly hopes so.\n\n\u201cMy world is strikingly different, even if the TMS energy is all dissipated,\u201d he said. He maintains his ability to read body language and communicate his own feelings through facial expression have improved dramatically.\n\n\u201cI feel I hear music with more clarity, too. Whether I think it\u2019s there, or it really is there, it\u2019s all the same,\u201d added Robison, a physically large man who smiles easily and often. To a reporter who first met him a decade ago, the changes in his demeanor are obvious: more relaxed, less guarded, more emotionally engaged.\n\nRobison also happens to be a gifted writer \u2014 his 2007 memoir \u201cLook Me in the Eye: My Life With Asperger\u2019s\u201d was a critically acclaimed bestseller. He\u2019s also a prolific blogger with a knack for dredging wry humor out of awkward situations.\n\nStill, for all the positive changes described in \u201cSwitched On,\u201d Robison\u2019s fourth book, there were negatives he was forced to deal with. TMS treatments chipped away at what he calls his \u201cprotective shield\u201d of autism, he writes, leaving him disoriented and depressed at times.\n\nHis second marriage, to a woman who herself suffered from chronic depression, came undone within a year of his initial TMS sessions. He frequently fell behind schedule at work (Robison runs a high-end car repair business in Springfield and lives in Amherst). Old friendships fell apart. As Robison\u2019s public profile rose \u2014 since \u201cLook Me in the Eye,\u201d he has divided his time between the car business and advocating on behalf of autism awareness \u2014 it disrupted his life on many levels.\n\nAt his lowest point, in 2009, Robison considered killing himself. Gaining and then losing abilities he\u2019d never possessed caused \u201ca mixture of sadness and wonder,\u201d Robison writes, summing up his condition in one word: \u201cjarred.\u201d\n\nRobison has previously written about growing up in Western Massachusetts in an intellectually prominent family (his father taught philosophy, his mother wrote poetry) plagued by alcoholism and mental illness. Much of that dysfunction was also chronicled in \u201cRunning With Scissors,\u201d the 2002 best-selling memoir by Robison\u2019s brother, Augusten Burroughs.\n\n\u201cSwitched On\u201d revisits that dark and stormy past. Yet it is more than a linear account of a life transformed by cutting-edge medical technology.\n\nA \u201ctechno geek\u201d with a deep knowledge of mechanical and electrical systems \u2014 he once worked as a sound engineer and special-effects designer for the rock band KISS \u2014 Robison delves into the latest brain-research findings and TMS\u2019s potential to help others like himself. He celebrates neurodiversity more generally, too, a subject he has been teaching at William & Mary College and Harvard Medical School.\n\nDuring the interview, Robison addressed the concerns and hopes he took into his TMS sessions, and the impact they\u2019ve had on his life since then. People close to him questioned whether the risk was worth it. Or even if an \u201cimproved\u201d version of himself would be someone they could love as much.\n\n\u201cSome thought I was crazy to let them do that to my brain, but I never had that fear,\u201d said Robison. \u201cThe technology was thoroughly familiar to me. And even though I knew these kinds of things could be dangerous if used wrong, I had confidence that a Harvard teaching hospital would use them safely.\u201d\n\nWeighing the risk-reward balance, he continued, \u201cI wondered, what if [the sessions] could really turn me on to being sensitive to other people? I\u2019d concluded that one reason I was kind of down was, I could not receive all these messages of love and kindness coming my way. People would ask, \u2018Can\u2019t you tell how happy you made us?\u2019 Well, no, I\u2019d say. I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nEven a 1 percent chance at success seemed worth the odds, Robison went on. And even if, as he\u2019d been warned, any changes in brain function might last only half as long as the 30-minute treatments themselves.\n\nThe negatives? These, too, he has come to accept.\n\n\u201cI was probably naive at the outset,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI had this idea that if I could only \u2018get\u2019 these happy messages, I would be happier. It didn\u2019t occur to me that most of the news out there, most of the emotion, is, if not bad, at least not all good. Not sweetness and light but a world of angst and avarice and greed. It was overpowering.\u201d\n\nRobison\u2019s TMS research team was led by Harvard neurologist Dr. Alvaro Pascual-Leone, who supplies an introduction to \u201cSwitched On.\u201d In a separate interview, Pascual-Leone says Robison\u2019s book demonstrates how small changes in brain function, however temporary, can have a life-changing impact.\n\nImagine, Pascual-Leone says, someone who cannot see color being told the sky is blue \u2014 an abstract, meaningless concept. Suddenly, for a brief period, he\u2019s able to see the sky in color. Forever after, the idea of \u201cblue\u201d will no longer be meaningless.\n\n\u201cNow translate that concept to emotions,\u201d he continues. \u201cIf you can give [someone like Robison] an idea of what emotions may be hidden behind a voice or face, then it enables his brain, without TMS, to change the way he approaches life and people.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Pascual-Leone acknowledges that these changes can be challenging as well as beneficial, as Robison describes. A recent paper by the BIDMC team concluded that TMS, while appealing and worth further study, is not yet recommended as an autism treatment. Rather, it may be best used to alleviate certain symptoms associated with spectrum disorder, including depression.\n\nStill, there are a number of clinics currently offering TMS as an autism treatment, a practice that concerns many researchers. \u201cPeople are desperate to help their loved ones, which I understand,\u201d Pascual-Leone says. \u201cWill it get more attention because of John\u2019s book? Absolutely. But his book does illustrate that the consequences can be long-lasting, and detrimental.\u201d\n\nRobison remains optimistic that as research continues, the potential benefits will outweigh the risks.\n\n\u201cI owe a great debt [to the Harvard team] for helping me see I was not broken or defective,\u201d he said. \u201cThat this painful disability of mine was a rare gift.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are scared of the science-fiction aspect to this, but it\u2019s real,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd what I wrote about in the book isn\u2019t 10 percent of what they\u2019re doing now.\u201d\n\n\u201cSwitched On\u201d ends in 2013. Robison, now happily remarried, says he\u2019s become even more militant advocating on behalf of what he calls \u201cmy tribe.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can look at my success in the world,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s not just in my mind.

Others who do not respond to metformin alone are given a second drug to help them maintain normal blood sugar levels. The researchers noted that which drug they should be prescribed is unclear.\n\nThe researchers pointed out that most patients are prescribed a class of drugs called sulphonylureas to supplement metformin. However, these drugs can sometimes lead to hypoglycemia and weight gain, which increases the patients' risk for heart attack and stroke.\n\nTo compare the effects of linagliptin to glimepiride (the most commonly used sulphonylurea), the researchers conducted a double-blind study over the course of two years. The study, which was funded by linagliptin's maker, Boehringer Ingelheim, involved 1,500 people from 16 countries with type 2 diabetes. None of the patients had responded to metformin alone.\n\nAlthough the effectiveness of the drugs were similar, the study showed the side effects of linagliptin were much less severe than those of glimepiride. The researchers found that 7 percent of patients on linagliptin experienced hypoglycemia, compared to 38 percent of patients treated with glimepiride.\n\nThe patients on linagliptin also had fewer heart attacks and strokes compared to those being treated with glimepiride.\n\nThe researchers argued that since linagliptin allows the body to increase the amount of insulin it produces in a glucose-dependent way, the risk for hypoglycemia may be significantly lower.\n\nAnd since hypoglycemia \"can have substantial negative clinical consequences\" in terms of risk for death, illness, mental function and poor quality of life, preventing it is crucial, study co-author Baptist Gallwitz, of Tubingen University Hospital, said in a news release.\n\nThe study authors pointed out linagliptin was licensed in 2011 and this is the first long-term study examining its safety and effectiveness. They added more research is needed to confirm their findings.\n\nOne expert said patients and doctors may still have to balance the superiority of linagliptin against its higher cost in comparison to older drugs.\n\nThe new study provides more evidence that drugs like linagliptin \"are just as good as the old standby sulfonylurea therapies, with the added benefits of inducing fewer hypoglycemic events, causing less weight gain, along with a likely decrease in cardiovascular events,\" said Dr. Stuart Weiss, an endocrinologist at NYU Langone Medical Center and clinical assistant professor at the NYU School of Medicine, New York City.\n\nBut millions of Americans suffer from type 2 diabetes, so \"cost issues favoring sulfonylureas may be the only reason for preferring continued sulfonylurea use,\" he added.

The company says this is a major step forward in treating PAD because, unlike stents, atherectomy \"leaves no metal behind.\"\n\nA stent is a tiny metal wire mesh tube that props open an artery and is left there permanently. But in leg arteries, the active flexing can cause a stent to break. Being able to clear the blockage just as well without stents reduces possible complications and gives greater flexibility to doctors later, said Brian Verrier, vice president and general manager of peripheral vascular for Covidien.\n\n\"This particular product plays very strongly into where we see the market going,\" he said. \"The potential is huge.\"\n\nAtherectomy is only used in about 15 to 20 percent of PAD cases, but Dr. Lawrence Garcia, a principal investigator in the study, said he expects that to change with these results.\n\n\"I think it has the potential to increase business for Covidien,\" Garcia, chief of interventional cardiology and vascular interventions at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Boston, said Thursday.

Some of the study authors and the Mayo Clinic have a financial interest related to technology used with this research.\n\nThe first study found that stool DNA testing detected five out of five cases of colon cancer and four out of five cases of a precancerous lesion called dysplasia in 10 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\n\n\"This study shows that cancer and precancer in IBD can be detected noninvasively,\" senior investigator Dr. David Ahlquist said in a Mayo news release. \"The 90 percent detection rate by stool DNA testing is remarkable. It's important for people with IBD because they are at much higher risk for colorectal cancer than the general population. Given the limitations of colonoscopies in detecting these lesions, stool DNA testing could play a complementary role to improve the effectiveness of cancer surveillance.\"\n\nIn the second study, the researchers found that stool DNA testing had a success rate of 71 percent in detecting serrated colorectal polyps, compared to a 7 percent detection rate with fecal blood tests.\n\nSerrated colorectal polyps, which are believed to be the forerunner in about 30 percent of colon cancer cases, can be difficult to detect using most types of colorectal cancer screening.

In fact, they did better than their counterparts who were given conventional lessons on good sleep habits, the study authors said.\n\nExperts said the findings, published online Feb. 16 in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, are encouraging.\n\nOn average, the effects of the mindfulness program were comparable to what's been seen in studies of sleep medications and \"talk therapy,\" said study leader David Black, an assistant professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles.\n\nAccording to Black, that means older adults can feel comfortable opting for \"mind-body\" practices as a way to address moderate sleep problems. But he also emphasized the structured nature of the program tested in his study.\n\n\"From our results, it is worth a try to engage in a structured mindfulness-based intervention led by a certified teacher with extensive experience,\" Black said.\n\nIn general, \"mindfulness\" practices encourage people to focus their attention on the present moment, instead of the past or future, and to take an objective look at their thoughts and emotions.\n\nSleep problems, Black explained, both affect and are affected by the mind. When people have difficulty sleeping, they often start to worry about it -- and that anxiety can worsen their sleep problems. On top of that, poor sleep itself can lead to psychological \"distress,\" such as depression symptoms, Black said.\n\n\"There is a cyclical pattern here between wakefulness, sleep disruption, worry and mood,\" he said.\n\nBy learning \"non-judgmental mindful awareness,\" Black said, people can begin to see their thoughts and feelings without reacting to them. In basic terms, it helps them relax -- a \"necessary prerequisite\" for sleep, Black noted.\n\nFor the current study, his team recruited 49 older adults with \"moderate\" sleep problems, based on their answers to a standard sleep-quality questionnaire. It asked a range of questions -- including whether the person had problems falling asleep or staying asleep, had difficulty breathing at night, or felt drowsy during the day.\n\nBlack's team randomly assigned the participants to six weekly sessions of either sleep \"hygiene\" education or mindfulness training.\n\nThe mindfulness group learned different meditation techniques, as well as how to eat and move with more attention. The program, Black said, did not specifically address sleep -- a topic that might only stir anxiety in people who are already worried about a lack of sleep.\n\nBy the end of the study, the mindfulness group was showing a significant improvement -- shaving about three points, on average, from their scores on the sleep-problem scale. The group that received standard education lowered their scores by an average of 1 point.\n\nThe mindfulness group also showed greater improvements in depression symptoms and daytime fatigue, the investigators found.\n\nBlack said the benefits of mindfulness training were on par with what's been found in studies of sleep medications and cognitive behavioral therapy -- a form of \"talk therapy\" that is often helpful for insomnia, for example.\n\n\"Cognitive behavioral therapy is highly effective,\" said Adam Spira, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in Baltimore.\n\nThe problem, Spira said, is that behavioral therapy for sleep problems is not always easily found -- and even when it's available, the process takes some effort.\n\n\"What I found most interesting about this [mindfulness] approach is that it's a non-drug option, and it's accessible to the community at large,\" said Spira, who wrote an editorial published with the study.\n\nClasses in meditation are available in many communities, and there are books, websites and CDs where people can learn mindfulness techniques. (The course Black's team studied is available online, at http://marc.ucla.edu.)\n\nThe caveat, according to Spira, is that this study tested that specific program. There is no guarantee that the course at your local senior center or a book would have the same chances of working.\n\nStill, Spira said, it's a promising approach to older adults' sleep problems -- and one that's needed. \"We definitely need a whole menu of treatment options,\" he said.\n\nOne major reason is that sleeping pills, the most common current treatment, are temporary fixes at best. Plus, Spira said, they can have side effects that are particularly dangerous for older people -- such as dizziness and balance problems that can lead to falls, and problems with attention and memory.\n\nThen there's the fact that sleep issues become common as people age, Spira said. Studies suggest that about half of adults age 55 and up have insomnia or some other sleep disturbance -- and that can have consequences for their physical and mental health.\n\nThere are still plenty of questions about the effects of mindfulness meditation on sleep quality. A key one is whether the benefits last.\n\nSpira said that with cognitive behavioral therapy, there is evidence that people's sleep keeps improving after their therapy sessions have ended. \"It'll be interesting to see whether people can learn mindfulness techniques, then see durable effects,\" he said.\n\nThe National Sleep Foundation has more on sleep disorders.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "It\u2019s clear that the reporter spent some time reviewing existing research on sleep disorders among older adults and in talking to the two main sources: the author of the study and an independent expert who wrote a commentary about the study.

Until recently, people with advanced melanoma often died within a year of diagnosis, even with chemotherapy.\n\nFor the first time, however, patients such as Herry have options.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved two new melanoma drugs in 2011 \u2014 the first new therapy for the disease in more than a decade \u2014 and approved two from GlaxoSmithKline on Wednesday. All improve survival by a few months.\n\nThe FDA also has put a Merck melanoma drug, lambrolizumab, on a fast track to approval by designating it a \"breakthrough\" therapy.\n\nSeveral other drug companies are also working on melanoma therapies.\n\nMelanoma research will take center stage at the four-day annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which begins Friday in Chicago. Doctors will present 288 melanoma studies, compared to only 62 a decade ago.\n\n\"The number of new melanoma therapies is sort of astonishing,\" says melanoma researcher Lynn Schuchter, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. \"The pace is unbelievable.\"\n\nNo one can claim to have cured melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, which is diagnosed in 77,000 Americans a year and kills more than 9,400.\n\nBut after decades of failure, the spate of new drugs is helping more patients than ever before, giving people like Herry more time and better quality of life, Schuchter says. Doctors now dare to hope that giving these new drugs in sequence, or in combination, will help people with melanoma live for years while feeling relatively good.\n\nUnlike traditional chemo, which indiscriminately kills growing cells, the new generation of melanoma drugs work in a precise way, based on a better understanding of the specific genes and proteins that drive cancer growth, says Timothy Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation.\n\n\"The reason we're seeing these breakthroughs is because we did the basic science research to help us understand how this cancer happens, how it escapes therapy and how it progresses,\" Turnham says.\n\nMany of the new drugs aim to remove melanoma's \"cloaking device,\" allowing it to be recognized and killed by the immune system, says Roy Herbst, chief of medical oncology at the Yale Cancer Center.\n\nOther drugs \u2014 such as the two approved Wednesday, trametinib and dabrafenib \u2014 target growth signals within cancer cells.\n\nHerry has tried two of the newer drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb: ipilumumab, approved in 2011, and an experimental drug called nivolumab.\n\nAlthough her tumors increased while taking ipilumumab, Herry says a CT scan earlier this year found they had shrunk by half after beginning nivolumab.\n\nThe most noticeable side effects from nivolumab have been moderate fatigue and vitiligo, a loss of pigment on some areas of her hands and arms, says Herry, 57, from Santa Cruz, Calif. She's been able to continue working as a registered nurse throughout these latest treatments.\n\nOlder melanoma therapies \u2014 including interferon, interleukin-2 and five chemo drugs \u2014 caused much more serious side effects, leaving her too sick to work, Herry says.\n\nWhen the new immune therapies work, they often keep cancer at bay for a long time, says Schuchter, who has patients whose cancer has been controlled by ipilumumab for three years.\n\nAt the cancer meeting, featured presentations include a study by researcher Mario Sznol, of the Yale Cancer Center, who will discuss long-term results of nivolumab. Researcher Stephen Hodi, of Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, will present the results of combining ipilumumab with an immune-stimulating drug. Doctors from New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center will present research on uveal melanoma, which occurs in the eye, and affects about 1,200 Americans a year.\n\nOther studies released in advance of the conference have shown positive results.\n\nNone of the new drugs works for everyone. And none are risk-free.\n\nIpilumumab can cause severe side effects, created when the immune system attacks the body itself, Schuchter says. Vemurafenib, approved in 2011, can cause non-lethal skin cancers.\n\n\"Doctors will say, 'There are side effects, but they are manageable,'\" Turnham says. \"Well, 'manageable' can mean something different to patients.\"\n\nTurnham knew a 19-year-old woman with melanoma who \"woke up bleeding every morning\" because of rashes caused by one of the new drugs, which targets mutations in a gene called MEK. The woman died a year later.\n\nDrugs such as ipilumumab can seem like breakthroughs to doctors because they help 15% of patients. Patients with a limited time to live may not be so positive, Turnham says.\n\n\"If you are a patient and someone says, 'There is an 85% chance of you spending $120,000 on a drug, and spending four months of your life being sick, with no benefit,' you're not going to be so excited.\"", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Adequate sourcing, including important contributions in quotes from the executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists in Britain have developed a type of HIV test using a USB stick that can give a fast and highly accurate reading of how much virus is in a patient\u2019s blood.\n\nThe device, created by scientists at Imperial College London and the privately-held U.S. firm DNA Electronics, uses a drop of blood to detect HIV, then creates an electrical signal that can be read by a computer, laptop or handheld device.\n\nThe researchers say the technology, although still in the early stages, could allow patients to regularly monitor their virus levels in a similar way to diabetes patients checking their blood sugar levels.\n\nIt could be particularly useful in remote settings to help HIV patients manage their treatment more effectively, since current tests to detect virus levels take at least three days and involve sending a blood sample to a laboratory.\n\n\u201cMonitoring viral load is crucial to the success of HIV treatment.

Moreover, the drug was being studied in clinical trials as a way to lower the risk of cancer, heart disease and dementia \u2014 not just for diabetics, but for everyone.\n\nFor Price, there was yet another possible benefit \u2014 as a treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome, an endocrine disorder that doctors thought might explain the difficulty she and her husband had had conceiving.\n\nSure enough, a month and a half after she had started taking metformin pills and even as she was enjoying the benefits of better blood-sugar control, Price became pregnant, eventually giving birth to a girl.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still taking metformin along with my insulin,\u201d said Price, 36, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes 14 years ago. \u201cI remember eating Mexican food one night, which can be a potential disaster for people with diabetes because of the carbs, but I noticed I needed only two-thirds to a half of the insulin I normally needed.\u201d\n\nSynthesized in the 1920s, metformin was first approved for treatment of Type 2 diabetes in the United Kingdom in 1958. It took until 1995 to get approval in the United States after a potentially fatal disorder linked to a similar drug was found to be rarely if ever associated with metformin.\n\nUnlike insulin shots, which help Type 1 diabetics break down sugar and starches in the blood, metformin lowers blood-sugar levels primarily by squelching the liver\u2019s tendency to release stored-up sugar into the bloodstream. Keeping that extra sugar (actually a form of sugar called glucose) out of the blood helps to maintain normal blood-sugar levels, thereby preventing such long-term complications as blindness, kidney failure and lower-limb amputation.\n\nAbout 29 million people in the United States have diabetes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 90 percent of them have Type 2, in which their bodies slowly fail to respond to normal levels of insulin, forcing their pancreas to produce so much that it\u2019s eventually exhausted. The estimated 2.5 million with Type 1, in contrast, lose their ability to produce insulin, usually within a matter of months, due to an autoimmune attack by the body on itself.\n\nToday, the range of ailments being targeted by metformin, a prescription drug sold under such names as Glucophage, Glumetza, Fortamet and Riomet, all share one characteristic: They are diseases related to aging.\n\n\u201cMetformin actually lowers the rate of cell turnover,\u201d said Michael Pollak, who has been studying metformin\u2019s effects on pancreatic cancer as chairman of oncology at McGill University in Montreal. \u201cIt makes cells divide less quickly. The rate-of-living theory defines aging as the number of cell divisions you undergo since you were a fertilized egg. If the theory is true, then people who age more gracefully have a slower rate of cell division. The question is whether the rate-of-living theory is operational in mammals.\u201d\n\nPollak says that none of the most exciting possible benefits for the drug have yet been proved in randomized clinical trials of non-diabetics. For now, the evidence suggesting benefits is limited to large studies of diabetics that have found, on average that those who take metformin tend to have lower rates of cancer, heart disease and dementia, and to live longer overall than those who take other drugs for diabetes. Those effects have also been seen in animal studies. But such evidence often does not pan out in human studies.\n\nAt a medical meeting in May, Pollak reported disappointing results from his first randomized, placebo-controlled trial of metformin for people with pancreatic cancer. \u201cIt yielded no benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cPlain old metformin given in the same dose as we do for Type 2 diabetes doesn\u2019t seem to be a breakthrough for cancer, at least for pancreatic cancer.\u201d\n\nMany other metformin clinical trials are underway for breast, colorectal, endometrial and other cancers.\n\nFor heart disease, the benefit of metformin over most other drugs for Type 2 diabetics has been seen repeatedly in clinical trials. For people without diabetes, only one study has been published, finding no apparent effect after 18 months. As with cancer, however, other studies are underway.\n\nFor dementia, which people with Type 2 diabetes have double the risk of developing compared with non-diabetics, metformin has been found in a number of studies to cut that risk substantially.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of excitement about metformin and dementia,\u201d said Rachel Whitmer, an epidemiologist at Kaiser Permanente in California.\n\nIn 2013, Whitmer presented the results of a study of about 15,000 people newly prescribed a medication for Type 2 diabetes: By the end of the five-year study, those who received metformin had a 40 percent lower risk of having developed dementia than those prescribed sulfonylureas, another common type of diabetes drug.\n\nBut, Whitmer notes, \u201cI don\u2019t think the story is complete. There needs to be more work in this area with all drugs for diabetes.\u201d\n\nFor Type 1 diabetes, researchers at the University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine published a study in May in which they added either a low dose of metformin or placebo pills to the insulin regimen of 74 adolescents. Those who received metformin lost weight \u2014 generally a benefit for those with diabetes \u2014 and needed less insulin after six months. Those who received the placebo needed more insulin than at the beginning of the study and saw their blood pressure rise. The one goal the study did not achieve was better blood-sugar control.\n\n\u201cThere is some benefit, but it wasn\u2019t the full benefit we hoped for,\u201d said Helen Nickerson, senior scientific program manager at JDRF, formerly known as the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, which partly funded the study. Even so, she said, she is hearing from doctors that growing numbers of them are prescribing metformin along with insulin to patients with Type 1 diabetes.\n\nNo one would suggest that a person with Type 1 diabetes stop taking their insulin. Doing so would be life-threatening. For those with Type 1, metformin is being tested only as an add-on to insulin.\n\nJDRF, meanwhile, is funding a clinical trial to see if metformin will reduce the risk of heart disease in people with Type 1, and it is funding a trial in Britain to see if the drug will prevent children from developing Type 1 in the first place.\n\nTerry Wilkin, a professor of endocrinology and metabolism at the University of Exeter, is leading the prevention trial. He theorizes that the risk of developing Type 1 rises when excess demand for insulin is placed on the pancreas in children who are even slightly overweight. His study will give low daily doses of metformin to children who are at high risk of developing Type 1.\n\n\u201cIf we can even slightly lower their average blood sugar with metformin,\u201d Wilkin said, \u201cI believe we can have a big benefit on their risk of developing Type 1.\u201d\n\nDespite all these potential benefits of metformin \u2014 and despite a recommendation from the American Diabetes Association that it be tried before any other drug for newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetics \u2014 a recent study found that only about half of all such people get metformin as their first prescribed medication. The study does not explain why that might be. Among the possibilities, experts say, are that newer drugs are being pushed heavily in direct-to-patient advertising and that some patients are turned off by the common though mild side effect of metformin \u2014 stomach upset and diarrhea \u2014 which can usually be avoided by starting on a low dose.\n\nThe author of the study, Niteesh Choudhry, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, also found that newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetics who start on metformin are the least likely to need an additional diabetes drug later.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that physicians and patients are not always choosing to start on metformin,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are legitimate reasons to put patients on one drug rather than another. But the guidelines do recommend metformin first.\u201d\n\nFor patients with Type 2 whose doctor started them on a drug other than metformin, he said, \u201cI certainly would encourage people to talk with their doctor. That\u2019s always a good thing.\u201d\n\nHurley is a New Jersey-based science journalist who writes frequently on diabetes and health.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "By and large, this story gives the reader\u00a0reasonable\u00a0information to judge source bias.

If we can control the autoimmunity, we may reverse the diabetes. We showed that the islets [cells] can start to work again,\" said Dr. Yong Zhao, an assistant professor in the section of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism at the University of Illinois at Chicago.\n\nThis treatment could potentially be useful in other autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\"It's quite remarkable that this approach, based on the re-education of immune cells, might work so well. The concept is very intriguing, and the treatment seems to be so simple and so safe,\" said Dr. Luca Inverardi, deputy director of translational research at the Diabetes Research Institute, University of Miami School of Medicine.\n\nBut he's also \"reasonably cautious,\" he said. \"The follow-up is long, up to 40 weeks, but it's not long enough to declare victory against diabetes yet,\" said Inverardi.\n\nAlso, he noted that the study involved only 15 Chinese people, and that type 1 diabetes is a bit different in that population. He said he'd like to see larger studies with a more diverse population, followed for a longer time.\n\nResults of the study were published online Jan. 9 in the journal BMC Medicine.\n\nType 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease, occurs when the body's immune system cells mistakenly attack the insulin-producing (beta) cells in the pancreas. Because their beta cells don't produce enough or any insulin, people with type 1 diabetes have to replace the lost insulin through injections to survive.\n\nStopping that autoimmune attack appears to be crucial to any treatment that hopes to cure or reverse type 1 diabetes.\n\nZhao's team developed a completely new approach. They take blood from a patient and separate out the immune system cells (lymphocytes). They briefly expose those cells to stem cells from umbilical cord blood from an unrelated infant and return the lymphocytes alone to the patient's body. The researchers have dubbed this \"Stem Cell Educator Therapy,\" because while exposed to the stem cells, the lymphocytes seem to relearn how they should behave.\n\nThe study participants, who were 15 to 41 years old, had had type 1 diabetes for an average of nine years. Six had some residual beta cell function and six did not. Both groups were given stem cell educator therapy. The other three people served as the control group.\n\nThe researchers measured C-peptide, a protein fragment that's a byproduct of insulin production, and found that the educator therapy group had improved levels of C-peptide at 12 weeks. These levels continued to improve until 24 weeks, and remained stable through the follow-up at 40 weeks. There were no changes in C-peptide in the control group.\n\nThe average daily dose of insulin dropped almost 39 percent after 12 weeks for the group with some beta cell function and 25 percent in those with no beta cell function, suggesting that the group with no beta cell function now produced insulin.\n\n\"That means if you stop the autoimmune reaction, you may see beta cell regeneration, or there might be other precursor cells in the pancreas. If these data are confirmed, this is a very provocative and remarkable finding,\" Inverardi said.\n\nThe average hemoglobin A1C level dropped 1.06 percent for those with residual beta cell function and 1.68 percent for those without beta cell function. A1C levels measure average blood sugar levels over two to three months, and people with type 1 diabetes are advised to maintain A1C levels below 7 percent. A drop of 1 percent in A1C levels can reduce the risk of complications.\n\nThis was an initial clinical trial designed to test for safety. Zhao said that in future trials he hopes that with additional treatments people might get off insulin altogether.\n\nBut, even if that's not possible, the recovery of some beta cell function would be welcome news. \"In the absence of complete remission, there are very sizable advantages to having some beta cell function,\" Inverardi noted.\n\nBoth experts said the treatment appears safe, with no risk of rejection. No significant side effects were reported during the trial, other than some arm soreness where blood was taken and returned.\n\nLearn more about type 1 diabetes from the Nemours Foundation's KidsHealth Web site.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "This story includes important context from an independent source.

The Food and Drug Administration approved Provenge this spring to treat advanced prostate cancer.\n\nBut now the study that led to FDA approval is finally out in this week's New England Journal of Medicine. And it's clear that experts are still scratching their heads about just how Provenge works.\n\nIt does work, sort of.\n\nIn the study, men with prostate cancer that no longer responds to hormone therapy (basically, chemical castration) lived about four months longer if they took Provenge than if they got placebo treatment. That's better than the only other approved treatment for such advanced cancers.\n\nBut, as the study's lead author Dr. Philip Kantoff acknowledges, \"It's not a home run; this is not going to cure prostate cancer.\"\n\nThe primary mystery is how Provenge extends life, since it doesn't shrink prostate tumors, as far as anyone can tell. \"Prolongation of survival without a measurable antitumor effect is surprising,\" writes Dr. Dan Longo of the National Institute on Aging in a NEJM editorial.\n\nDeep in the data is further mystery.\n\nProvenge is supposed to work by, in effect, vaccinating patients against their own cancers using a patient's own white blood cells.\n\nThe theory is that the custom-made vaccine incites patients' immune cells to attack the cancer. The study shows that patients who got Provenge were indeed more likely to mount immune-cell responses to a prostate cancer antigen in the test tube. But oddly, the patients who had these activated immune cells didn't survive any longer than those who didn't.\n\nThe other side of the immune system \u2013 the antibody arm -- showed a different picture. Patients who had a good antibody response to Provenge lived longer than those who didn't.\n\nNobody yet knows just how to explain these results. Longo, the NEJM editorialist, says he'd be more convinced if the placebo patients had received infusions of white blood cells that had been exposed just to the general immune-stimulating part of the Provenge treatment, without the prostate antigen part.\n\nThe way the study was done, he says, \"does not allow one to conclude\" that Provenge is working because it mobilizes the immune system specifically against prostate cancer.\n\nBut, after all, Provenge is just the first cancer immunotherapy on the market. So it's not surprising there's a lot to be learned, and that it's pretty pricey.\n\nOther immunotherapy approaches are in the pipeline, along with fancier versions of drugs to block the hormones that feed prostate cancer.\n\nMeanwhile, Dendreon, the Seattle-based company that makes Provenge, says there's a waiting list for the drug. The company estimates 100,000 American men have the kind of hormone-resistant, metastatic cancer the drug is approved to treat. But the company can only make enough at this point for 2,000 patients in the first year.\n\nSo does the waiting list contain thousands of men?

The promising data from this pilot study could have greater implications for adults with food allergies.\n\nThe cancer patients who were allergic to allergens such as cat dander and ragweed saw their allergic skin test reactivity reduced by 80 to 90 percent in one week, and this persisted with continued use of the drug for at least one to two months. The findings were published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology in May.\n\n\"It almost completely knocked out the patients' skin test and blood cell allergic reactivity,\" said senior author Dr. Bruce Bochner, the Samuel M. Feinberg Professor of Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.\n\nThis FDA-approved drug, ibrutinib, is currently on the market as a successful and less-toxic alternative to chemotherapy for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma. In this recent study, Bochner and his team performed traditional allergy skin tests and the basophil activation test, a related allergy test using blood cells, on cancer patients before they had taken ibrutinib and again after one week and after one to two months of taking it.\n\nA rather unlikely pairing - cancer and allergies - Bochner thought to test if a cancer drug could prevent allergic reactions by collaborating with Feinberg's oncology department.\n\nHe knew that the generally well-tolerated cancer drug was successful in blocking a protein inside a cell called Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK). BTK plays a crucial role in B cell activation, growth and maturation and mast cell and basophil activation, the latter two cells being responsible for immediate allergic reactions. Bochner teamed up with Northwestern oncologist Dr. Leo Gordon and colleagues to test if this BTK inhibitor could shut down an enzyme inside cells that is involved when you have an allergic reaction.\n\n\"Ibrutinib is considered a game changer in these two types of cancers,\" said Gordon, the Abby and John Friend Professor of Cancer Research at Feinberg. \"We understood that it might have some biologic effects in what Bruce is interested in, so we were happy to participate in his study. It's an interesting repurposing of that drug.\"\n\nWhile the study was small - only two patients qualified out of about 35 that were screened for allergies - the implications are much larger for later phases of this study. Bochner and his colleagues Drs. Anne Marie Singh and Melanie Dispenza are now testing how successful the drug is at targeting allergies to food, such as tree nuts and peanuts.\n\n\"Preventing or lessening the severity of an allergic reaction to a food you've ingested that you're allergic to is kind of the holy grail of food allergy treatment,\" Bochner said. \"I don't know if this or similar drugs will ever make it possible for a peanut-allergic person to eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but we're excited to use this approach to teach us how to lessen the risks of food allergy reactions.\"\n\nCurrently, the study is being expanded to adults with food allergy to see if their skin test and basophil activation test responses show a similar reduction with just a few doses of ibrutinib and how long such benefits might last. If the results are favorable, the next step would be to get funding to actually test whether taking a BTK inhibitor will improve the ability of food-allergic adults to eat foods they're allergic to.\n\n\"The hope is that drugs like BTK inhibitors will protect people with food allergies from having anaphylaxis, or at least increase how much of that food they can eat without reacting,\" Bochner said. \"Maybe they'll increase from being able to eat just one peanut to 10 before they react. Or maybe they'll be able to eat a full meal's worth of peanuts.

Using both together resulted in a 51 percent response, compared with a 30 percent response in women given Herceptin alone. Those given Tykerb alone had a 25 percent response.\n\n\"What we observed was a massive improvement in response,\" Baselga said.\n\nGlaxoSmithKline, the maker of Tykerb, helped fund the study.\n\n\"Lapatinib was approved for advanced breast cancer in 2007,\" Baselga said. \"The question we had was, what is the efficacy if we give it in early-stage breast cancer prior to surgery?\"\n\nBaselga and his colleagues conducted a trial treating 455 women from 23 countries. All had HER2-positive breast cancers. All had tumors larger than about three-fourths of an inch.\n\nIn HER2-positive breast cancer, test results are positive for a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, which promotes cancer cell growth.\n\nIn the study, 154 women got Tykerb, 149 Herceptin and the other 152 both drugs. All had the drug regimen before surgery, with Taxol (paclitaxel), a standard chemotherapy, added after six weeks. After 12 more weeks of treatment, the women had surgery.\n\nAt that point, researchers evaluated who had better responses. The women continued the treatments for one more year, allowing researchers to follow them and see how the approaches affected survival.\n\nBaselga stressed that the study looked only at women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancers, and that the drug Tykerb is approved now only for advanced breast cancers.\n\nThe study is well done and important, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society. The two drugs, he said, \"affect the same pathway but do it in a different way.\"\n\nWhile the combination showed a better response rate, \"there is also an increased level of side effects,\" he noted.\n\nWhile no major heart problems occurred, those on Tykerb alone or the two-drug combination had more diarrhea. Liver-enzyme alterations were also more frequent when Tykerb was used.\n\nGlaxoSmithKline notes that liver toxicity with the drug may be severe and that deaths have been reported, although the cause of the deaths has not been determined.\n\nThe important question, however, has not been answered yet, Lichtenfeld said. That's the effect on overall survival in using the two-drug approach. The researchers are continuing to evaluate that.\n\nCost is another consideration: Tykerb runs about $4,000 a month wholesale, and retail prices could be higher.\n\nIn another study, published online Jan. 17 in The Lancet Oncology, researchers from Germany reported that Tykerb is less beneficial than Herceptin as a single-drug therapy.\n\nThey assigned 620 women with HER2-positive breast cancer to get standard chemotherapy plus Herceptin or Tykerb.\n\nThey looked to see which drug was better at eliminating invasive cancer in the breast and metastatic cells in the lymph nodes.

VVA affects 50 to 70 percent of post-menopausal women, and is characterized by pain with sexual activity, dryness, and discomfort. Current on-the-market treatments for VVA include both over-the-counter creams and moisturizers as well as several safe and effective prescription treatments in cream, tablet, ring or oral form.\n\nPrevious survey research completed by Dr. Kingsberg and others has shown that while 32 million women may be experiencing symptomatic VVA and suffering from related impacts on sexual function, interpersonal relationships, self-esteem and overall quality of life, only 7 percent are currently using a prescription therapy to alleviate symptoms. Though they may suffer from physical and emotional pain as a result of VVA, women may not feel comfortable discussing these symptoms with a healthcare professional, may not recognize the symptoms as treatable, may not fully understand the treatment options available, or if they did receive treatment, found the current prescription treatment options inconvenient, messy, or uncomfortable to use.\n\nFinancial disclosure: Dr. Kingsberg has served as a consultant for TherapeuticsMD, the manufacturer of TX004HR, as well as Acerus Pharmaceuticals, AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Bayer Healthcare, Emotional Brain, Materna, Novo Nordisk, Nuelle, Palatin Technologies, Pfizer, Sermonix Pharmaceuticals, Shionogi Inc. and Valeant Pharmaceuticals.\n\nFounded in 1866, University Hospitals serves the needs of over 1 million patients per year through an integrated network of 18 hospitals, more than 40 outpatient health centers and 200 physician offices in 15 counties throughout northern Ohio.

It did not prove cause and effect.\n\nResearchers for years have investigated vitamin D as a potential anti-cancer tool, but none of the findings have been strong enough to warrant a recommendation, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society.\n\n\"Everyone comes to the same conclusion -- yes, there may be some benefit, but we really need to study it carefully so we can be certain there aren't other factors that make vitamin D look better than it is,\" Lichtenfeld said. \"These findings are interesting, and show that vitamin D may have a role in improving outcomes in cancer care.\"\n\nIn this study, researchers measured blood levels of vitamin D in 1,043 patients enrolled in a phase 3 clinical trial comparing three first-line treatments for newly diagnosed, advanced colon cancer. All of the treatments involved chemotherapy combined with the targeted anti-cancer drugs bevacizumab and/or cetuximab.\n\nVitamin D is called the \"sunshine vitamin\" because human bodies produce it when the sun's ultraviolet rays strike the skin. It promotes the intestines' ability to absorb calcium and other important minerals, and is essential for maintaining strong, healthy bones, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health.\n\nBut vitamin D also influences cellular function in ways that could be beneficial in treating cancer, Ng said. For example, she said it appears to reduce cell growth, promote the death of diseased cells, and inhibit the formation of new blood vessels to feed cancerous tumors.\n\nThe study authors found that certain types of cancer patients tended to have lower vitamin D levels. These included people whose blood specimens were drawn in the winter and spring months, people who live in the northern and northeastern states, older adults, blacks, overweight or obese people, and those who had lower physical activity and were in worse physical condition.\n\nThe patients were divided into five groups based on vitamin D levels, ranging from low to high. After adjusting for prognosis and healthy behaviors, the researchers found that patients in the group with the highest levels of vitamin D lived about eight months longer on average than those in the group with the lowest levels.\n\n\"We had a lot of information on their tumor, their treatment and their survival times, and their diet and lifestyle,\" Ng said. \"That really allowed us to adjust for other potential factors that could influence what we're seeing.\"\n\nIt also took longer for cancer to progress in people with higher vitamin D levels -- an average 12.2 months compared with about 10 months in the group with the lowest. No significant differences were seen with regard to the type of therapy the patients received.\n\nThis increase in progression-free survival is the most compelling evidence indicating that vitamin D makes a difference in colon cancer, said Dr. Smitha Krishnamurthi, an associate professor of hematology and oncology at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland.\n\n\"That is interesting because that's more of a cancer-specific endpoint as opposed to overall survival, which could be influenced by other factors like heart health,\" Krishnamurthi said.\n\nEveryone should maintain healthy vitamin D levels anyway, to protect their bone health, Ng and Krishnamurthi said.\n\nBased on this new study, Krishnamurthi said she would emphasize the importance of vitamin D for patients with colon cancer.\n\n\"They should take supplements to bring it into normal range, because we know it is good for bone health and it may have an anti-cancer effect,\" she said.\n\nHowever, \"if someone has a normal vitamin D level, I wouldn't take supplements to increase it because we won't know the true effect on cancer until we see the results of a clinical trial,\" she said.\n\nThe U.S. National Institutes of Health funded the study.

It is estimated that the condition affects one in 110 children in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"There is a serious unmet need in the autism world, where diagnosis is currently done by subjective reports, and after the child has missed many developmental milestones,\" said lead researcher Joy Hirsch, a professor of functional neuroradiology, neuroscience and psychology, and director of the Functional MRI Laboratory at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City.\n\n\"It is now possible to develop an objective imaging diagnostic,\" she said. Indeed, the researchers found a difference between autistic brains and typical brains in the level of responsiveness in language areas, Hirsch noted.\n\n\"What we can measure are signals in the brain, in a specific language area, that are depressed in autistic children and normal in typical children,\" she said.\n\nAlthough this study was done with school-aged children and teens, the same test can be done with children as young as 18 months, Hirsch noted. \"We know this technique can be used on young children,\" she said.\n\nThe report was released in the May 31 online edition of Radiology, in advance of publication in the August print issue.\n\nFor the study, 12 children with autism and 15 children without the condition underwent functional MRI (fMRI) exams. Both groups of children ranged in age from 4 to 17 years.\n\nWhile the children were undergoing the fMRI, the researchers played recordings of their parents talking to them and watched for brain activity in areas of the brain responsible for hearing and understanding language.\n\nThe researchers found no differences in the activity in the hearing area of the brain between the two groups. However, in the language comprehension area, there was significantly more activity among typical children than among children with autism, Hirsch's group noted.\n\nTo further test this screening approach, another group of 27 autistic children, aged 5 to 17, underwent fMRI and the researchers were able to identify 26 of them as autistic.\n\nDr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York in Lake Success, said that \"although the investigators did indeed find significant differences on neuroimaging between controls and autistic children, the clinical utility from a diagnostic standpoint is unclear.\"\n\nThere are important limitations to the study, Adesman said.\n\nFor one, this study was done in school-aged children, many of whom were actually teenagers, so it is impossible to know if these differences in neuroimaging would also be found in younger patients, Adesman pointed out.\n\n\"It is during the toddler/preschool years that autism typically presents and needs to be diagnosed,\" he explained.\n\n\"The other major limitation of this study is that the investigators did not look at whether these brain differences are specific to children with autism, or if they would also be seen, for example, in children with language delays who are not autistic,\" Adesman said.\n\nHirsch noted the study is preliminary and, as such, has some limitations. For one, it is not known whether this technique can identify autism across the entire spectrum of the disorder.\n\n\"There are questions about how this varies across the severity of autism. Also, can we distinguish autism from other forms of developmental delay?\" she asked. \"These are things that aren't known.\"\n\nFurther work is needed to refine the test, Hirsch added. \"This is not the diagnostic that you can package and send to all community health centers in the United States. This is an announcement that this can be done,\" she said.\n\nThis test costs no more than a standard MRI, which runs around $1,500, Hirsch noted.\n\nAnother expert, Dr. Robert F. Lopez-Alberola, chief of pediatric neurology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, said that \"it's nice to have an objective measure, but it doesn't really do much.\"\n\nUltimately, he said, \"the diagnosis of autism is a clinical diagnosis. I see this as having more implications for research into the pathophysiology of autism.\"\n\nHowever, if this test could be done in really young children, it might help identify autism so that treatment can begin early, Lopez-Alberola suggested. \"We know the earlier we begin interventions, the greater the likelihood of better outcome,\" he said.\n\n\"Although this technique holds promise for identifying infants at risk for autism, it still needs to be determined whether the atypical patterns of brain activation are specific to autism,\" said Geraldine Dawson, chief science officer for Autism Speaks.\n\n\"It is possible that children who have delayed language but not autism would also show the same pattern. Regardless, this research is promising as a method for identifying young children at risk for autism,\" Dawson said.\n\nFor more on autism, visit the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "HealthDay continues its laudable tradition of listing the story\u2019s sources at the end of the piece..

Behavior and quality of life also improved.\n\nBut surgery also produced serious adverse effects in one-third of the children, most frequently a weakness on one side of the body, known as hemiparesis. The researchers said that was to be expected and, without surgery, patients probably would have experienced similar problems as a result of their continuing seizures.\n\n\u201cWhat the study clearly shows is surgery for children produces seizure freedom compared to children not operated on for similar conditions,\u201d senior author Dr. Manjari Tripathi, a professor of neurology and epilepsy at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi, told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.\n\nNot only \u201cdoes it reassure us that several surgical procedures are effective,\u201d she said, it demonstrates that surgery \u201cshould be done as early as possible\u201d once it becomes clear that a child is not responding to two anti-seizure medications.\n\nAbout 50 million people worldwide suffer with epilepsy and drugs can\u2019t control the seizures in approximately 30 percent of the cases.\n\n\u201cThis is the first randomized study to look at surgical outcome in children,\u201d said Dr. Donald Schomer, director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. He was not involved in the research.\n\n\u201cThe results are impressive,\u201d he told Reuters Health by phone. Adults who undergo surgery often suffer from the collective effect of years of uncontrolled seizures. \u201cThe study in kids shows if you reduce the time from the onset of seizures from the 15 to 20 years you see in adults down to four to five years, the outcome is much better. It\u2019s documentation that these techniques really work.\u201d\n\nAlthough 77 percent were judged by the Tripathi team to be seizure-free at the end of the study, some of those children actually had seizures immediately after surgery. Yet the cases were judged to be a success because the seizures decreased in frequency over time. Ultimately, 37 percent never had a seizure in the year after surgery.\n\nWhen all seizures were taken into account, children who did not have surgery were four times more likely to have a seizure during that year than youngsters in the surgery group, the researchers calculated.\n\nSuccess rates ranged from 87 percent to 100 percent depending on the type of surgery used to correct the child\u2019s particular brain abnormality.\n\nSurgery improved quality of life and social well-being, and it didn\u2019t affect IQ, something that can decline with ongoing seizures. But Dr. Schomer said the children were only followed for one year, and \u201cthat may be too soon to see a noticeable change\u201d in the intelligence quotient.\n\nPost-surgery weakness was seen in 15 of the 19 patients who had a serious side effect following surgery.\n\nThe weakness \u201cis significant,\u201d Dr. Tripathi said. \u201cThe child may not be able to ambulate by his- or herself. But with physical therapy, all regain the lower and upper limb function within six months. The only thing that does not improve is the wrist and the fingers. They are left with this minor deficit. But even before surgery, some of them have this weakness.\u201d\n\nOther side effects depended on the area of the brain that was removed or disconnected from the rest of the brain.\n\nIn contrast, 16.5 percent of the children waiting for surgery had a serious injury as a result of their continuing seizures.\n\nThe surgery \u201chad a transforming effect on how they get along in life,\u201d Dr. Tripathi said. \u201cMany could go back school earlier or go back to being tutored, and get on with their life.\u201d\n\nBut a major problem facing these children is getting insurance companies to pay for such surgeries, said Dr. Schomer of Beth Israel.\n\nRather than pay $35,000 to $50,000 on surgery that might cure the problem and prevent further damage to the child, insurance companies prefer to demand that more drugs be tried, even if the odds of them working in drug-resistant cases is small, he said.\n\n\u201cStudies like this lend credence to the idea that the earlier you do it, the better the outcome,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope insurance companies will look at this and realize that early detection and surgery, if appropriate, will ultimately save them money in the long term.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2gVClQv The New England Journal of Medicine, online October 25, 2017.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The article does quote a Boston specialist who was not a part of the study, which was conducted in India.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Sharon Belvin's nightmare with cancer began in 2004, when she was just 22.\n\nBelvin was an avid runner but said she suddenly found she couldn't climb the stairs without \"a lot of difficulty breathing.\"\n\nEventually, after months of fruitless treatments for lung ailments like bronchitis, she was diagnosed with melanoma \u2014 a very serious skin cancer. It had already spread to her lungs, and the prognosis was grim. She had about a 50-50 chance of surviving the next six months.\n\n\"Yeah, that was the turning point of life, right there,\" she says.\n\nWhat Belvin didn't know at the time was that a revolutionary treatment for melanoma had begun testing in clinical trials. An immunologist named Jim Allison, now at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, had figured out that if the immune system was tweaked just right, it could do a better job of killing the cancer than the usual treatments. (Joe Palca worked for Allison early in both men's careers.)\n\nAllison's treatment was still experimental, but if it worked, it had the potential to save Belvin's life.\n\n\"It's a new modality for treating cancer,\" Dr. Samuel Broder, a former director of the National Cancer Institute, says now of Allison's pioneering research. \"It used to be there were three basic treatment options for cancer \u2014 surgery, radiation and chemotherapy \u2014 or some combination of those three. It's fair to say there's now a fourth option.\"\n\nAllison's long search for this new kind of treatment \u2014 one that has since become a lifesaver for some cancer patients \u2014 began around a decade before Belvin got sick, when Allison was running a lab at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nAt the time, he was what you could call a research scientist's research scientist. He was fascinated by certain powerful cells of the immune system \u2014 T cells. A subset of white blood cells, T cells travel around the body and can \"protect us against just about anything,\" Allison says.\n\nT cells do recognize cancer cells, but not in a way that can eliminate the disease. Allison had been studying T cells for years, and thought that by tinkering with one key molecule on the outside of these cells, he could enhance their response to cancer, enough to eradicate the illness.\n\nHe and one of his grad students ran an experiment to test the tweaked T cells on cancerous tumors in mice, and the initial results astounded them. The T cells seemed to be doing just what Allison had hoped they would do \u2014 shrink the tumors and kill the cancer.\n\nAllison repeated the experiment with more mice over his winter break. After a few tense days, the tumors again disappeared.\n\n\"These mice were cured,\" Allison says.\n\n\"I've been doing this sort of stuff for years, and I'd never seen anything like that,\" Allison says. \"And I thought, 'If we could do that in people, this is going to be amazing.' \"\n\nAllison tried to persuade drugmakers to create a human version of the treatment that had worked in mice. He thought they would jump at the chance to try a new approach.\n\nBut the biotech companies he met with didn't bite. In those days, most firms were focused on drugs that would target tumors directly, and Allison was asking them to try something very different.\n\n\"This was targeting the immune system, not the cancer,\" he says. \"We weren't trying to kill the cancer cells. We were letting the T cells kill the cancer cells.\"\n\nThanks, but no thanks, the companies told him.\n\n\"I got very depressed,\" Allison says. He was sure this was the most important work of his career, but he had to get others on board.\n\nEventually, a scientist attending one of Allison's research talks was intrigued enough to contact a pal at the biotech firm Medarex. The company had recently developed technology that could make a human version of Allison's therapy, and was willing to give it a try.\n\nIt took a decade, but eventually Allison's big idea was ready for testing in people. A clinical trial to study the drug \u2014 now called ipilimumab, or Ippy for short \u2014 was set up at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.\n\nAllison decided he wanted to be part of this next chapter in the testing of immunotherapy, so he packed up his California lab and moved it to Sloan Kettering.\n\nAs it happens, Belvin was also in New York \u2014 a patient of Dr. Jedd Wolchok at Sloan Kettering. By the fall of 2004, Belvin had run through all the treatment options available to her. Nothing had worked to control the melanoma; it continued to spread dangerously throughout her body.\n\nBelvin remembers feeling sick and depressed, and says she wasn't even paying much attention when Wolchok walked into the exam room and suggested one last treatment.\n\n\"Sharon, we have an opportunity to participate in a clinical trial here. It's something you should consider,\" Wolchok told her.\n\nBelvin says she signed up without hesitation. After just four injections of Ippy across three months, her cancer was nearly gone. And at Belvin's follow-up appointment a year later, Wolchok delivered news that was hard for her to take in: \"Sharon, you no longer have cancer.\"\n\nAnd in the next breath, Belvin recalls, \"he goes, 'Oh, the guy who invented this is upstairs. Do you want to meet him?' \"\n\n\"Yes, of course I want to meet him!\" she told her doctor.\n\nWolchok called Allison, who was working nearby, and told him to drop everything and come to the clinic \u2014 a part of the hospital Allison had rarely seen. Though the research scientist couldn't imagine why Wolchok was in such a rush, he quickly figured it out as he opened the door and was greeted by Belvin with a huge hug.\n\nBelvin says she tried not to tackle him. \"It was hard to control myself,\" she says. \"I owe this man my life.\"\n\nBelvin was the first recipient of the immunotherapy that Allison had ever met. \"It really meant a lot,\" he says. \"It reminded me what it's all about at the end of the day.\"\n\nThat was in 2005; today, Sharon Belvin is still cancer-free.\n\nIppy is now sold under the brand name Yervoy by Bristol-Myers Squibb, which bought Medarex in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, Jim Allison has become a bit of a celebrity in the cancer research world. Among other honors, he was a 2015 recipient of the prestigious Lasker Award for his achievements in medical science.\n\nHe's become well-known among patients, too. Now and again, Allison fields calls from patients yearning to learn from the master himself what it will take to cure their disease.\n\nAllison can't really answer them. Each case is different, and using a patient's own cells to destroy tumors won't work in every patient or in every type of cancer. Still, the approach offers promise to some people that other therapies can't, and has transformed the way doctors think about cancer treatment.\n\nIt might be too early to say we're going to cure cancer, Allison says, \"but we're going to cure certain types of cancers. We've got a shot at it now.\"", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story quotes a former director of the National Cancer Institute, which is good.

Now, researchers say a special scoring system might point to those people at highest risk for colon cancer, who may need the test the most.\n\nThe system might also make colon cancer screening more efficient and boost the number of people who get checked for the disease, said a team led by Dr. Thomas Imperiale of Indiana University Medical Center, in Indianapolis.\n\nOne expert said more efforts are needed to get people to undergo colonoscopy, which is currently recommended once every 10 years beginning at age 50.\n\n\"Five percent of the U.S. population will be diagnosed with colon cancer within their lifetimes,\" said Dr. Arun Swaminath, director of the inflammatory bowel disease program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He was not involved in the new research.\n\nSwaminath noted that one study published in 2012 found that \"colonoscopy reduced the risk of death from colon cancer by 53 percent, by removing polyps. No other procedure is available to remove polyps from anywhere in the colon.\"\n\nAnd while some areas of the United States have rates of compliance with colonoscopy guidelines of 75 percent or more, \"many areas have poor colon cancer screening rates,\" he added.\n\nImperiale's team noted that not all people deemed to be at \"average risk\" for colon cancer face the same risk of the disease, and so some might benefit more from invasive colonoscopy than others.\n\nIn the new study, the Indiana researchers looked at more than 4,400 Americans who were scheduled to undergo their first screening colonoscopy. They calculated a clinical \"score\" for each of these patients, based on their health information, and the five most common risk factors for colon cancer: age, sex, waist size, smoking and family history.\n\nThen they looked at the results of each patient's colonoscopy. The study found that patients classified under the scoring system as low-risk did, in fact, have far fewer advanced abnormal growths that might develop into cancer, compared to patients classified as high-risk.\n\nSo, patients scoring at the lower end of risk for colon cancer might be able to have less invasive screening tests (such as the fecal occult blood test), while those at higher risk would require a colonoscopy, Imperiale's team concluded.\n\nHowever, Swaminath wasn't fully sold on the notion.\n\nHe believes that the scoring system \"was only modestly able to separate people within the risk groups.\" Swaminath pointed out that even the new study found that \"low- to intermediate-risk patients still have a risk between of between 1.9 percent to 9.9 percent of harboring a polyp that can develop into cancer.\"\n\nFor now, he said, the data from this study is not strong enough to spur any changes in current screening recommendations.\n\nDr. Jules Garbus is co-chief of colon and rectal surgery at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, N.Y.

Patients were able to tolerate bapineuzumab for two to four additional years without the emergence of any new safety concerns,\" said Dr. Stephen Salloway, author of one of the studies. \"This is important because we are conceptualizing this drug as a long-term treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\nEncouraging does not translate into certainty, however, another expert pointed out.\n\n\"I think it is too early to tell from the data from this small Phase 2 safety trial,\" said Ian Murray, an assistant professor of neuroscience and experimental therapeutics at Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine in College Station. \"We will have to wait for larger trials to comment on this as a potential therapy.\"\n\nThe studies were funded by Pfizer Inc. and Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy.\n\nAlthough bapineuzumab has shown promise in certain Alzheimer's patients, other research found that patients taking a higher dose of the drug had an increased risk of brain inflammation from water retention. This resulted in headache, memory loss, hallucinations, reduced coordination or other symptoms. But no problems were seen with lower doses.\n\nBapineuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, which binds to and might be able to eliminate beta amyloid peptide in the brains of people with Alzheimer's. Most experts believe that the build up of beta amyloid proteins, which accumulate as plaque, is responsible for Alzheimer's.\n\nSalloway's study looked at the drug's safety in 194 Alzheimer's patients, most of whom had mild- to-moderate Alzheimer's and participated in a long-term (78 weeks or longer) study. Some of the participants were followed for four years or more.\n\nNinety-one percent of participants had side effects, about a quarter of which were attributable to bapineuzumab. Of these, 85 percent were mild or moderate.\n\nThe overall rate of vasogenic edema (water on the brain) was 9.3 percent, a number that decreased over time, said Salloway, a professor of neurology and psychiatry at Alpert Medical School of Brown University and director of the Butler Hospital Memory and Aging Program in Providence, R.I. The edema was symptomless in most cases, he said.\n\nThe other study, which involved looking at more than 2,000 MRI scans from 262 patients, found 36 cases of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) may have been linked to the bapineuzumab.\n\nThese imaging abnormalities may indicate inflammation of the brain caused by water retention.\n\nBut only 8 of those 36 cases involved symptoms, and they were more likely to be found in patients with APOE-e4 who were taking higher doses of the drug. The likelihood of these effects diminished with additional infusions of lower-dose bapineuzumab.\n\n\"There is a growing sense that VE [vasogenic edema] or ARIA [amyloid-related imaging abnormalities] is a manageable side effect and may actually be a sign that the drug is clearing amyloid from the brain and the blood vessels,\" said Salloway. \"Treatment will require ongoing monitoring with MRI.\"\n\nThe researchers, who said monitoring of bapineuzumab will continue, are now awaiting the results of a larger Phase III trial on the drug.\n\nBecause this study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nThe Alzheimer's Association has more on this condition.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story included a quote from Dr. Ian Murray who did not appear to have a role in the studies reported on as well as comments from Dr. Salloway, lead author of the study.

It is produced when enzymes act to convert a precursor molecule, angiotensinogen. Lisinopril is a member of a drug family called ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors. Other examples of ACE inhibitors are benazepril (Lotensin), enalapril (Vasotec) and ramipril (Altace).\n\nReducing angiotensin production by giving ACE inhibitors can lower blood pressure. The same effect can be achieved with drugs that block the cell receptors through which angiotensin acts. Called angiotensin receptor blockers, these drugs have a greater protective effect against dementia than ACE inhibitors, the study found. Such drugs include candesartan (Atacand), irbesartan (Avapro), losartan (Cozaar) and valsartan (Diovan).\n\nIn the study, men taking an angiotensin receptor blocker had a 24 percent lower incidence of dementia than those taking other cardiovascular drugs. The risk was 19 percent lower for men taking ACE inhibitors. The risk was nearly halved for those taking both angiotensin-targeting drugs.\n\nIn men with Alzheimer's disease, use of an angiotensin receptor blocker reduced admission to nursing homes by half. Combined angiotensin medication therapy reduced nursing home admissions by two-thirds.\n\nWolozin said that it's not clear why the drugs would have a beneficial effect on the brain, but improved blood flow probably plays a role.\n\n\"If you get no blood to the brain, you're not going to think well,\" he said. \"Also, in brain cells there is more than one kind of angiotensin receptor. By blocking bad receptors, you are left with the good ones so that helps neurons become more resilient.\"\n\nBut the evidence is not sufficient to support routine use of angiotensin receptor blockers to prevent Alzheimer's disease, Wolozin said. The new report describes an observational study, one that lacks the strict controls that are needed for convincing proof.\n\n\"Any study like this is hypothesis-generating,\" he said. \"You only know for sure when you have done clinical prospective trials.\"\n\nHis advice for anyone considering angiotensin receptors blockers to reduce dementia risk: \"They should consult with their physicians.\" There are potential hazards, such as too-low blood pressure that can lead to damaging falls, Wolozin said.\n\nCaution was urged by Dr. Richard B. Lipton, vice chairman of neurology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, who has done work on the genetics of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThe angiotensin hypothesis makes sense, Lipton said, because improved blood flow to the brain helps nerve cells and reduces formation of Alzheimer's-related amyloid protein.\n\nBut there have been a number of observational studies implicating various molecules, including estrogens, in dementia, he said. \"The sequence is that when you do the randomized trial, you don't get the same effect,\" Lipton said.\n\nOn the other hand, such randomized trials usually include people who are close to having Alzheimer's disease, and \"it could be different if you gave the drugs earlier,\" Lipton said.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has more on blood pressure medications.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story did quote one independent expert who injected a cautionary note \u2013 in addition to the lead researcher.

There is no correlation between getting the Gardasil vaccine and seriously adverse effects such as \u201cautoimmune diseases (including Guillain-Barre Syndrome and multiple sclerosis), anaphylaxis, venous thromboembolism, and stroke.\u201d\n\nMind you, all these things and more have been used by people who attack vaccines as an argument against it.

For example, a young girl died tragically not long after getting the vaccine, and it got a lot of press, but it was later found that she died of a completely unrelated cause. This, sadly, is expected; more than 178 million doses of Gardasil have been given worldwide, and given that huge number it\u2019s a statistical certainty that some young people will die not long after getting them. But as the saying goes, correlation is not causation. The vaccines are not to blame here.\n\nEven more frustrating about this vaccine is that it\u2019s being fought by an unusual group of people; while most anti-vax leanings are not affiliated with any particular political persuasion, Gardasil gets attacked additionally by conservatives who think that girls getting it will become more promiscuous, because HPV is a sexually transmitted disease.\n\nHowever, this has been shown to be false. Worse, these same people tend to promote abstinence-only education, which has been shown conclusively to be the worst possible sex education; kids taught his way tend to have more pregnancies and more STIs than ones who are taught progressive, healthy sex ed.\n\nIt\u2019s like Bizarro world, where everything is backward. All the evidence shows Gardasil to be safe and to be effective against a virus that causes horrific illnesses. It also shows that the claims made by anti-vaxxers are wrong, and that people fighting the vaccine because of their own sexual biases are making things far worse.\n\nAnd yet they dig in. They insist real science is wrong, that their anecdotes are better, that the entire medical industry is on the take (which is silly beyond reason).\n\nBut that\u2019s where we are. When it comes to health issues, especially ones tied to sexuality, reason goes out the window and emotions take over.\n\nThat\u2019s why I am very, very clear about this: I and my family are all up to date with our vaccinations, and my daughter has had all three stages of the Gardasil vaccine (we\u2019d have done that if she had been a boy, too).

It did reduce the severity and duration of colds slightly, but the researchers say the difference was so slight it ended up being pretty meaningless, and not worth the effort or expense of taking all that vitamin C.\n\nPeople apparently protected from colds by vitamin C, Senay said, are those who subject their immune systems to extraordinary amounts of physical stress, such as people who run marathons, or do serious trekking in the winter. The researchers found that these people were 50 percent less likely to catch cold if they took vitamin C daily. But they were the exceptions.\n\nThe message from the researchers, Senay observed, is that, if your activity profile doesn't match that of people like these, vitamin C won't keep colds away.\n\nBut, she emphasized, this doesn't mean vitamin C is useless, not by a long shot.\n\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, vitamin C has several important benefits. Preventing colds just isn't one of them. Vitamin C is an important building block for the growth and repair of tissues throughout your body, including skin, tendons, ligaments and blood vessels. If you suffer an injury, vitamin C is a vital part of the healing process. Vitamin C is also an antioxidant, which means it's believed to help prevent or minimize conditions that include cancer, heart disease, and inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. So, even if it doesn't fight colds, you do need a certain amount of it daily for other aspects of your health.\n\nFor adult males, the recommended amount is 90 milligrams per day. For women, it's 75 milligrams. Citrus fruits and juices, strawberries and broccoli are among the many foods that are rich in vitamin C.\n\nSo, where does this research leave us in the fight against the common cold?\n\nIt makes us look toward other methods, aside from vitamin C, Senay concluded. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the best bit of cold prevention involves not taking a pill, but doing simple, if boring, things such as washing your hands, thoroughly and often.\n\nUntil a magic pill is found, keeping your hands clean, and not sharing items such as drinking cups and utensils with someone who has a cold, are still considered the most practical ways to avoid getting sick.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The\u00a0segment accurately\u00a0indicates the\u00a0high crediblity of the Cochrane\u00a0group, and there appear to be no underlying conflicts of interest that would call the conclusions into question. \u00a0", "answer": 1}, {"article": "For decades, doctors have sought every dieter's dream of weight loss: a pill that could pare away the pounds without any harmful effects.\n\nTheir quest is an acknowledgment that losing weight and keeping it off is not just a matter of willpower, of resisting the siren call of the ice cream in the fridge.\n\nNew research has shown that weight gain changes the brain and body. And even when we starve ourselves thin, we often can\u2019t reverse those alterations. So we just slowly pack the pounds back on because our brains think we need them.\n\nBack in the early '90s, doctors thought they had struck gold with a combination of drugs, fenfluramine and phentermine, or fen-phen, that seemed to magically melt fat away. But within a couple of years some patients began to develop very scary side effects: damage to heart valves that could lead to heart failure and a kind of high blood pressure, pulmonary hypertension, that proved to be fatal in some cases.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration called on drugmakers to pull fenfluramine \u2014 the culprit part of the combo \u2014 which they did. The media attention that followed would scare patients off diet pills for years \u2014 a fear that continues today.\n\nBut with America growing fatter with each passing year \u2014 two-thirds of Americans are now overweight or obese \u2014 doctors believed that they had no choice but to continue their quest for a safe, and at least moderately effective, medicine that would help patients drop excess pounds and keep them off.\n\nThe latest generation of drugs seems to do just that. They won\u2019t make a morbidly obese patient model-thin, but they\u2019ll shave off enough excess fat to improve heart disease risk factors such as hypertension, high blood sugar and high cholesterol, experts say.\n\nTake lorcaserin, for example. Researchers found that the drug could lead to consistent and sustained loss of more than 5 percent of weight in nearly 40 percent of patients at risk for heart attacks, strokes and death from cardiovascular disease without increasing the likelihood of such events, according to a report published recently in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThe new study followed participants for three years. \u201cMost prior studies of weight loss only followed patients for a year, and a few out to two years,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Erin Bohula, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a cardiologist and investigator with the TIMI Study Group at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. \u201cThe challenge with lifestyle interventions is that patients tend to lose weight up front, and then the weight is regained, sometimes beyond the original weight. So the challenge is to keep it off long term.\u201d\n\nWhile a 5 percent weight loss may not seem like a lot, \u201cthat is the point where there is a very significant reduction in the risk of diabetes,\u201d said Dr. Louis Aronne, a professor of metabolic research at Weill Cornell Medicine. \u201cA 5 percent loss of weight is associated with a 50 percent lower risk of diabetes and a 10 percent loss is associated with an 80 percent lower risk.\u201d\n\nPatients in Bohula\u2019s study did see improvements in hypertension and blood sugar levels with weight loss.\n\nPeople need to realize that in obesity treatment, just as in hypertension therapy, one drug won\u2019t fit all, Aronne said. \u201cIn hypertension, there are more than 100 medications and more than 10 therapeutic categories,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s why treatment of hypertension is so effective. No one medication for hypertension works for every single person. That\u2019s how we need to start looking at drugs for obesity.\u201d\n\nWhat many don\u2019t understand is that weight gain leads to changes in the brain that may not be reversible, Aronne said. \u201cThe process of weight gain makes it hard to lose weight,\u201d he explained, adding that in certain areas of the brain nerve cells are actually damaged and sometimes die.\n\nThat new understanding is why some major medical associations have come to see diet pills as intrinsic in the battle against obesity.\n\nWeight loss drugs are recommended supplements to diet and exercise \u2014 included, for example, in 2013 guidelines by the American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology and the Obesity Society, Bohula said. But there still \u201care relatively low rates of use. There are probably a few reasons for this, including cost, if not covered by insurance, and a perception that these agents are not safe in light of the history with weight loss agents.\u201d\n\nIn fact, a 2017 report that examined the medical records of 2.2 million patients found that fewer than one in 50 patients who were eligible for a diet pill prescription received one.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t surprise Dr. Vijaya Surampudi, an endocrinologist and an assistant professor of medicine at the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cI prescribe them all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they are not very popular. I think a lot of physicians are uncomfortable prescribing weight loss medications. Fen-phen scares off a lot of them.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to dieting, Americans need to reframe how they view weight loss, Surampudi said. \u201cPeople need to focus on the health benefits,\u201d she said. \u201cRather than thinking about how good you\u2019ll look in that dress, you need to be thinking, \u2018I won\u2019t get diabetes now.\u2019\"\n\nBeyond that, a little patience goes a long way. \u201cWe didn\u2019t put the weight on overnight,\u201d Surampudi said. \u201cAnd we shouldn\u2019t expect it to come off overnight.\u201d", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story didn\u2019t disclose that two physician sources, Erin Bohula and Louis Aronne, received payments in the tens of thousands of dollars in connection with weight drugs, according to ProPublica\u2019s Dollars for Docs database.\nA third physician quoted in the story, Vijaya Surampudi, has received smaller payments from Novartis that were not tied to a weight-loss drugs.\nThe story would have benefited from more independent sources.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "\"They make you feel great; I'm not going to lie, you take a couple pills, you feel relaxed, you don't feel nervous, you have the weight of the world off your shoulders,\" said one young man named Brian who would not letreveal his identity.\n\nBut, as CBS News contributor Dr. Sanjay Gupta reports, he's willing to talk about how prescription painkillers took over his life: Ten OxyContin pills a day, costing up to $12,000 a month.\n\n\"You know I just couldn't stop taking them; my body just craved them,\" he said.\n\nPrescription drug addicts like Brian have unique problems beating their habit because they see themselves as different from street junkies. Often because of the stigma attached to methadone clinics, they resist traditional treatment.\n\nBrian felt helpless. He felt out of control. Until one day, he heard a commercial on his car radio.\n\n\"By the grace of God, I say it was a higher power. This ad came on the radio,\" he said. \"I called the next day and two days later I was in the study.\"\n\nHas he had any use of prescription painkillers since he started the study?\n\n\"None,\" he said.\n\n\"I didn't know how bad being on opiates affected me,\" he said.\n\nPatients in the trial are given counseling as well as a new kind of anti-addiction drug called Suboxone. It's an orange pill that's dissolved under the tongue.\n\nHere's how it works: When people are addicted, new receptors are created in the brain, which crave opioids. If left unsatisfied, the receptor sends pain signals to the brain - this is withdrawal. If the receptor is satisfied with drugs, the withdrawal symptoms stop and the person gets high.\n\nSuboxone works by taking the place of the opioids in the receptor - not only shutting off withdrawal symptoms but also blocking the effects of any new drugs.\n\n\"It can be quite powerful when people begin to use it. They say, 'oh, I feel regular!'\" explained Dr. Marc Gourevitch. \"The brain chemistry has been stabilized to some extent.\"\n\nGourevitch believes that we can now revolutionize the treatment of drug addiction.\n\nUnlike methadone, Suboxone can be prescribed by any doctor, even a family physician, so treatment for addicts can now be convenient and discreet.\n\n\"When you're taking Suboxone, you're not high, you're not in withdrawal, you're at work, you're dealing with your loved ones, you're having regular interactions...you're going about your life,\" Gourevitch said.\n\nFor Brian, life now involves not only counseling and but a personal inventory as well.\n\n\"I didn't want to wake up every morning and chop up OxyContin, sniff it again during the day. I mean, that's a terrible way of life,\" he said. \"The Suboxone got me far enough away to look and say 'wow, look at your life.

It also doesn't change the very limited treatment choices.\n\nBut the new criteria, which were developed by the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association, are almost guaranteed to prompt confusion, even in people who are thinking quite clearly.\n\nThe guidelines say, for instance, that newly developed \"biomarker\" tests, such as assays for proteins in spinal fluid, and some specialized brain scans can be used for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's. But, the guidelines say, the tests are to be used only for research, and not for diagnosing Alzheimer's in the general public.\n\nThe distinction is nothing to worry about for patients and their families. \"You don't need a biomarker test\" for everyday clinical practice, says David Knopman, a professor of neurology at the Mayo Clinic, who was co-chairman of the group that revised the dementia diagnosis. The existing tests for Alzheimer's are adequate, he says. And those biomarkers? \"It's in the fine print, but it definitely says in multiple places that the biomarkers are for research purposes.\"\n\nWhy? Well, the biomarker tests and PET scans aren't yet accurate enough to reliably diagnose Alzheimer's, and haven't been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. And it's also because there are no treatments that can prevent, slow or stop early signs of Alzheimer's.\n\n\"For research, there's a lot of value,\" Knopman says. \"For everyday clinical use, very very little.\"\n\nAbout 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's. The hallmark signs are problems with thinking, learning, and memory. The current definition, created in 1984, describes Alzheimer's that way. But over the past few years there's been solid evidence that Alzheimer's starts damaging the brain years before a person starts having noticeable problems thinking. Scientists have been putting a lot of effort into trying to identify what starts the disease process, but have so far come up empty.\n\nThe new definitions, which were just published online by the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia, acknowledge this dimly understood early phase of Alzheimer's. Now there are two new pre-dementia phases: mild cognitive impairment and \"preclinical Alzheimer's.\"\n\nIn mild cognitive impairment, a person's changes in thinking are noticeable to himself, friends, or family. They would show up on tests of memory and recall, but don't interfere with everyday activities. Alzheimer's is just one possible cause. Because there are no treatments to prevent or stop Alzheimer's, many people may not consider this diagnosis a blessing.\n\nThe second new phase, preclinical Alzheimer's, is much squishier. There's no list of symptoms that a doctor can whip out to say you've got it. Rather, the goal in creating this category is to see if scientists can define when the disease starts, and track it through biomarker tests, brain imaging, or other yet-to-be-invented tests. If that happens, it might someday lead to ways to prevent Alzheimer's. But for now this category is useful only to researchers.\n\nThe goal in all this, according to the Alzheimer's Association, is to increase opportunities for earlier diagnosis and treatment. The problem is that there aren't yet any reliable tools for earlier diagnosis and treatment. The new criteria are really a call for more research \u2014 and the money to fund it. That would be good for the Alzheimer's Association and the National Institute on Aging, which sponsored the work on the new criteria.\n\nAnd it does leave one wondering if a lot more worry will be generated by the notion of \"preclinical Alzheimer's,\" when science and medicine can't offer anything to ease those fears.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "\n\n\n\nAlthough the overall tone of this story is cautious and balanced, only one expert is quoted.

Since then, clinicians and dermatologists have seen a rise in demand for minimally invasive laser-based treatments, including tattoo removal. However, it is difficult for the laser light, which is held at a distance from the skin, to be perfectly and selectively absorbed by only the targeted birthmark or tattoo. Now, researchers from the University of Missouri have developed instruments that transmit laser light into the tissue through direct contact. The techniques developed by the interdisciplinary team can be used by dermatologists and will reduce safety concerns in laser dermatology by improving laser transmission through surface layers of the skin.\n\nLaser techniques come with risks, including eye damage. Open-air transmission, in which the clinician holds the laser at a distance from the patient, is typical during normal dermatological procedures and presents a hazard to both the patients\u2019 and doctors\u2019 eyes.

Both drugs are used as \"adjuvant\" therapy, meaning they are used after surgery and chemotherapy and/or radiation to prevent the cancer from coming back.\n\nThe committee reviewed recent studies which had investigated aromatase inhibitors and/or tamoxifen in women with this particular subtype of breast cancer.\n\nUsing an aromatase inhibitor alone or with tamoxifen therapy improved disease-free survival compared with using tamoxifen alone. It also reduced the risk of the cancer spreading to other parts of the body.\n\nWomen who are pre- or peri-menopausal when they are diagnosed should be given tamoxifen for five years. Aromatase inhibitors are not effective in this age group, the experts note.\n\nAll three aromatase inhibitors on the market - Arimidex (anastrozole), Femara (letrozole) and Aromasin (exemestane) - were essentially equal in their benefit.\n\nThe drugs can also cause side effects that need to be taken into account when prescribing.\n\n\"We've learned a huge amount about the various side effect profiles of these products,\" said Dr. Harold J. Burstein, co-chair of the ASCO committee which prepared the guidelines and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. \"Aromatase inhibitors are clearly associated with osteoporosis and with bone and joint [conditions]. They might also be associated with a greater risk of hypertension and high cholesterol.\"\n\nFor its part, tamoxifen is also associated with serious side effects, which can include cataracts and uterine cancer as well as life-threatening blood clots and stroke.\n\nAnd cost will also be a factor in decision-making.\n\n\"Aromatase inhibitors are very expensive.

Knee surgery for a torn meniscus is done about half a million times each year in the U.S.\n\nThe new federally funded study compared surgery with a less drastic option. Researchers at seven major universities and orthopedic surgery centers around the U.S. assigned 351 people with arthritis and meniscus tears to get either surgery or physical therapy. The therapy was nine sessions on average plus exercises to do at home, which experts say is key to success.\n\nAfter six months, both groups had similar rates of functional improvement. Pain scores also were similar.\n\nThirty percent of patients assigned to physical therapy wound up having surgery before the six months was up, often because they felt therapy wasn't helping them. Yet they ended up the same as those who got surgery right away, as well as the rest of the physical therapy group who stuck with it and averted an operation.\n\n\"There are patients who would like to get better in a 'fix me' approach\" and surgery may be best for them, said Elena Losina, another study leader from Brigham and Women's Hospital.\n\nHowever, an Australian preventive medicine expert contends that the study's results should change practice. Therapy \"is a reasonable first strategy, with surgery reserved for the minority who don't have improvement,\" Rachelle Buchbinder of Monash University in Melbourne wrote in a commentary in the medical journal.\n\nAs it is now, \"millions of people are being exposed to potential risks associated with a treatment that may or may not offer specific benefit, and the costs are substantial,\" she wrote.\n\nSurgery costs about $5,000, compared with $1,000 to $2,000 for a typical course of physical therapy, Katz said.\n\nOne study participant \u2014 Bob O'Keefe, 68, of suburban Boston \u2014 was glad to avoid surgery for his meniscus injury three years ago.\n\n\"I felt better within two weeks\" on physical therapy, he said. \"My knee is virtually normal today.\" He still does the recommended exercises several times a week.\n\nRobert Dvorkin had both treatments for injuries on each knee several years apart. Dvorkin, 56, director of operations at the Coalition for the Homeless in New York City, had surgery followed by physical therapy for a tear in his right knee and said it was months before he felt no pain.\n\nThen, several years ago, he hurt his left knee while exercising. \"I had been doing some stretching and doing some push-ups and I just felt it go 'pop.'\" he recalls. \"I was limping. It was extremely painful.\"\n\nAn imaging test showed a less severe tear and a different surgeon recommended physical therapy. Dvorkin said it worked like a charm \u2014 he avoided surgery and recovered faster than from his first injury. The treatment involved two to three hour-long sessions a week, including strengthening exercises, balancing and massage. He said the sessions weren't that painful and his knee felt better after each one.\n\n\"Within a month I was healed,\" Dvorkin said. \"I was completely back to normal.\"", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story quoted two study leaders, an editorial author, and two patients.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - It may be possible to predict which women will develop a dangerous complication of pregnancy called pre-eclampsia weeks before they ever show the first symptoms, an international team of researchers reported Monday.\n\nThey found a series of 45 different compounds linked with metabolism that were different in the women destined to develop the condition, and said that could form the basis of a test.\n\nSuch a \u201cmetabolic fingerprint\u201d test could save the lives of thousands of women, Philip Baker of the University of Alberta in Canada, who helped lead the study, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIf we can bring the rates of maternal deaths in undeveloped countries down to the rates in developed countries, by being able to determine which women are at the greatest risk for developing pre-eclampsia, then it has that potential to save thousands of lives,\u201d Baker said.\n\nThere is currently no test to predict which women will develop pre-eclampsia, which is marked by high blood pressure and high protein levels in urine.\n\nIf mothers and their babies survive, the women later have a higher risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke and diabetes. The babies are usually born prematurely and suffer complications all their lives.\n\nThe cost of treating mothers with pre-eclampsia is $45 billion a year in the United States, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, the researchers said.\n\nIn undeveloped countries, 75,000 women die from pre-eclampsia each year.\n\nWriting in the journal Hypertension, the researchers said they did a simple study, testing the blood of 60 women who developed pre-eclampsia later in pregnancy and 60 women who did not.

In the study, women who skipped chemo based on the test had less than a 1 percent chance of cancer recurring far away, such as the liver or lungs, within the next five years.\n\n\u2018\u2018You can\u2019t do better than that,\u2019\u2019 said the study leader, Dr. Joseph Sparano of Montefiore Medical Center in New York.\n\nAn independent expert, Dr. Clifford Hudis of New York\u2019s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, agreed.\n\n\u2018\u2018There is really no chance that chemotherapy could make that number better,\u2019\u2019 he said. Using the gene test \u2018\u2018lets us focus our chemotherapy more on the higher risk patients who do benefit\u2019\u2019 and spare others the ordeal.\n\nThe study was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. Results were published online Monday by the New England Journal of Medicine and discussed at the European Cancer Congress in Vienna.\n\nThe study involved the most common type of breast cancer \u2014 early stage, without spread to lymph nodes; hormone-positive, meaning the tumor\u2019s growth is fueled by estrogen or progesterone; and not the type that the drug Herceptin targets. Each year, more than 100,000 women in the United States alone are diagnosed with this.\n\nThe usual treatment is surgery followed by years of a hormone-blocking drug. But many women also are urged to have chemo, to help kill any stray cancer cells that may have spread beyond the breast and could seed a new cancer later. Doctors know that most of these women don\u2019t need chemo but there are no great ways to tell who can safely skip it.\n\nA California company, Genomic Health Inc., has sold a test called Oncotype DX since 2004 to help gauge this risk. The test measures the activity of genes that control cell growth, and others that indicate a likely response to hormone therapy treatment.\n\nPast studies have looked at how women classified as low, intermediate or high risk by the test have fared. The new study is the first to assign women treatments based on their scores and track recurrence rates.\n\nOf the 10,253 women in the study, 16 percent were classified as low risk, 67 percent as intermediate and 17 percent as high risk for recurrence by the test. The high-risk group was given chemotherapy and hormone-blocking drugs. Women in the middle group were randomly assigned to get hormone therapy alone or to add chemo. Results on these groups are not yet ready \u2014 the study is continuing.\n\nBut independent monitors recommended the results on the low-risk group be released, because it was clear that adding chemo would not improve their fate.\n\nAfter five years, about 99 percent had not relapsed, and 98 percent were alive. About 94 percent were free of any invasive cancer, including new cancers at other sites or in the opposite breast.\n\n\u2018\u2018These patients who had low risk scores by Oncotype did extraordinarily well at five years,\u2019\u2019 said Dr. Hope Rugo, a breast cancer specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, with no role in the study. \u2018\u2018There is no chance that for these patients, that chemotherapy would have any benefit.\u2019\u2019\n\nDr. Karen Beckerman, a New York City obstetrician diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011, said she was advised to have chemo but feared complications. A doctor suggested the gene test and she scored very low for recurrence risk.\n\n\u2018\u2018I was convinced that there was no indication for chemotherapy. I was thrilled not to have to have it,\u2019\u2019 and has been fine since then, she said.\n\nMary Lou Smith, a breast cancer survivor and advocate who helped design the trial for ECOG, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, which ran it, said she thought women \u2018\u2018would be thrilled\u2019\u2019 to skip chemo.\n\n\u2018\u2018Patients love the idea of a test\u2019\u2019 to help reduce uncertainty about treatment, she said. \u2018\u2018I\u2019ve had chemotherapy.

In order to explore the widely held belief that practicing yoga can relieve mental stress, the team reviewed more than 100 studies on the effect of yoga and mental health.\n\n\u201cMost individuals already know that yoga produces some kind of a calming effect. Individually, people feel better after doing the physical exercise,\u201d says lead study author Dr. P. Murali Doraiswamy, a professor of psychiatry and medicine at Duke University Medical Center. \u201cMentally, people feel calmer, sharper, maybe more content. We thought it\u2019s time to see if we could pull all [the literature] together \u2026 to see if there\u2019s enough evidence that the benefits individual people notice can be used to help people with mental illness.\u201d\n\nTheir findings suggest that yoga does in fact have positive effects on mild depression and sleep problems, and it improves the symptoms of psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and ADHD among patients using medication.\n\nThe researchers focused on 16 studies that recorded the effects of practicing yoga on mental-health issues ranging from depression, schizophrenia, ADHD, sleep complaints and eating disorders to cognitive problems. They found positive effects of the mind-and-body practice for all conditions with the exception of eating disorders and cognition. Those studies involved too few participants or produced conflicting results to draw any meaningful conclusions.\n\nSome of the studies included in the analysis even suggested that yoga might affect the body in ways similar to antidepressants and psychotherapy. For instance, yoga may influence brain chemicals known as neurotransmitters (boosting levels of feel-good agents like serotonin), lower inflammation, reduce oxidative stress and produce a healthier balance of lipids and growth factors \u2014 just as other forms of exercise do.\n\nEmbracing yoga as a complementary treatment for mental disorders is not uncommon. Yoga is a feature in many veterans\u2019 centers throughout the country, backed by research funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Huffington Post reported that many troops use yoga as a form of treatment for PTSD, for example, with companies like Warriors at Ease training instructors in yoga techniques specifically catered to those in the military. A study published earlier this month of 70 active-duty troops found daily yoga eased anxiety and improved sleep.\n\nThe researchers say there\u2019s enough evidence to warrant a larger study on the effects of yoga on mental health, and it should be considered as part of treatment for more disorders. \u201cMany millions of Americans are doing yoga and many millions of Americans have mental illnesses and are popping psychiatric pills daily. Despite all of this, the vast majority of studies looking at the benefits of yoga are all small studies. We did not come across a single study where there was a coordinated effort done by some large agency to really conduct a large national study,\u201d says Doraiswamy.\n\nBut while the research is promising, yoga likely won\u2019t be a panacea for mental illness. Nor should patients try to replace their medications with the practice. \u201cWhat we are saying is that we still need to do further, large-scale studies before we are ready to conclude that people with mental illnesses can turn to yoga as a first-line treatment,\u201d says Doraiswamy. \u201cWe are not saying throw away your Prozac and turn to yoga. We\u2019re saying it has the promise and potential. If a large national study were done, it could turn out that yoga is just as good and may be a low cost alternative to people with unmet needs.\u201d In the meantime, he says it doesn\u2019t hurt to add yoga to existing treatments so patients can take advantage of any potential benefits.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Researchers tend to be optimistic about the treatments they are studying, and the study author quoted in this story is no different.

He said Medherant\u2019s technology would eliminate most side effects created by oral medication.\n\n\u201cOne of the interesting areas that we plan to explore in partnership with large companies is actually using our platform technology to include other drugs that previously maybe haven\u2019t been suitable for topical or transdermal delivery - or drugs which may have not got through the regulatory filings because, for instance, they might have caused stomach irritation or other side effects when taken orally,\u201d said Lee.\n\nThe TEPI patch incorporates new adhesive technology developed by global adhesive company Bostik.

This can cause less blood to reach the brain and, in rare cases, may also trigger a stroke if plaque breaks off and becomes lodged in the small vessels in the brain.\n\n\"Only a small minority of patients with carotid stenosis will suffer a stroke,\" said lead researcher Dr. Raffi Topakian, from the Academic Teaching Hospital Wagner-Jauregg in Linz, Austria.\n\nThe problem is identifying the patients at the highest risk for stroke, he said. Most patients with carotid stenosis can be managed with medications such as cholesterol-lowering drugs, blood pressure-lowering drugs and blood thinners such as aspirin, he added.\n\nBut those at highest risk may need a surgical procedure called an endarterectomy, which clears the carotid arteries of plaque.\n\n\"We found with two ultrasound methods we could differentiate the patients who are at very low risk of suffering a stroke -- lower than 1 percent per year -- from patients at high risk of stroke -- higher than 8 percent per year,\" Topakian said.\n\nThe patients who are at high risk are candidates for surgery, he said. Endarterectomy is not recommended for most people with carotid stenosis since the problem can be managed with drugs and there are risks, including stroke, with the procedure, Topakian said.\n\nThose who would benefit from the ultrasound test are people with known carotid stenosis who are fit for surgery, Topakian said. \"If they are too sick or frail for surgery, it makes no sense to do the ultrasound,\" he said.\n\nIn addition, people at high risk for stroke are also candidates for ultrasound, Topakian said. This would include people with high cholesterol, high blood pressure or heart disease, he said. \"This test could be a good tool to identify the right patients for surgery,\" Topakian said.\n\nOf course, anyone with symptomatic carotid stenosis is a candidate for immediate surgery, Topakian said. Warning signs include transient ischemic attacks (TIAS), or mini-strokes, which cause no permanent damage but are often followed by a stroke within a few days.\n\nThe report was published in the Aug. 17 online edition of Neurology.\n\nFor the study, a research team led by Topakian followed 435 people with asymptomatic carotid stenosis for two years.\n\nEach participant had an ultrasound to see if there were signs that a stroke might occur. These included tiny blood clots, which pass into the brain, and a type of plaque called echolucent plaque, which is fattier than other plaque and linked with an increased risk for stroke.\n\nAmong those in the study, 38 percent had the fattier-than-normal plaque, 17 percent had signs of blood clots and 27 percent had both the fattier plaque and blood clots, the researchers found.\n\nIn addition, over the two years of the study, 10 people had TIAs.\n\nMoreover, people with the fattier plaque were more than six times more likely to have a stroke than those people without the plaque, and those with the fattier plaque and clots had a risk that was 10 times higher, Topakian's team found.\n\nNonetheless, some experts said that research suggests that patients with no symptoms are better off without the surgery.\n\nDr. Lars Marquardt,a professor of surgery at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in Germany and co-author of an accompanying journal editorial, said surgery for people with asymptomatic carotid steno sis is done too frequently.\n\nMarquardt noted that the risks associated with the surgery are a lot higher than leaving the stenosis as it is and starting aggressive medical treatment.\n\n\"Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis don't get the surgical procedure early enough, and patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis have too many surgical interventions,\" Marquardt said.\n\nWhen treating asymptomatic carotid stenosis, Marquardt doesn't think the case has been made for distinguishing between high- and low-risk patients.

You'd take a nice big sniff to breathe in the sweet but subtle floral scent. Upon walking into a public restroom, you'd likely do just the opposite--abruptly limiting the flow of air through your nose. Now, researchers reporting in the Cell Press journal Current Biology on July 2 have found that people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) don't make this natural adjustment like other people do. Autistic children go right on sniffing in the same way, no matter how pleasant or awful the scent.\n\nThe findings suggest that non-verbal tests related to smell might serve as useful early indicators of ASD, the researchers say.\n\n\"The difference in sniffing pattern between the typically developing children and children with autism was simply overwhelming,\" says Noam Sobel of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.\n\nEarlier evidence had indicated that people with autism have impairments in \"internal action models,\" the brain templates we rely on to seamlessly coordinate our senses and actions. It wasn't clear if this impairment would show up in a test of the sniff response, however.\n\nTo find out, Sobel, along with Liron Rozenkrantz and their colleagues, presented 18 children with ASD and 18 normally developing children (17 boys and 1 girl in each group) with pleasant and unpleasant odors and measured their sniff responses. The average age of children in the study was 7. While typical children adjusted their sniffing within 305 milliseconds of smelling an odor, the researchers report, children on the autism spectrum showed no such response.\n\nThat difference in sniff response between the two groups of kids was enough to correctly classify them as children with or without a diagnosis of ASD 81% of the time. Moreover, the researchers report that increasingly aberrant sniffing was associated with increasingly severe autism symptoms, based on social but not motor impairments.\n\nThe findings suggest that a sniff test could be quite useful in the clinic, although the researchers emphasize that their test is in no way ready for that yet.\n\n\"We can identify autism and its severity with meaningful accuracy within less than 10 minutes using a test that is completely non-verbal and entails no task to follow,\" Sobel says. \"This raises the hope that these findings could form the base for development of a diagnostic tool that can be applied very early on, such as in toddlers only a few months old. Such early diagnosis would allow for more effective intervention.\"\n\nThe researchers now plan to test whether the sniff-response pattern they've observed is specific to autism or whether it might show up also in people with other neurodevelopmental conditions.

The results, published by the Journal of the American Medical Association, demonstrate the first major therapy advance for the condition in nearly 40 years.\n\nFunded by the National Eye Institute (NEI) and conducted by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net), the trial compared Lucentis injections with a type of laser therapy called panretinal photocoagulation, which has remained the gold standard for PDR since the mid-1970s. Although laser therapy preserves central vision, it can damage night and side vision, so researchers have sought therapies that lack these side effects.\n\nThe trial results \u201cprovide crucial evidence for a safe and effective alternative to laser therapy against PDR,\u201d said NEI Director Paul A. Sieving, M.D., Ph.D.\n\n\u201cPatients who received Lucentis showed a little bit better central vision, much less loss of their side vision, and substantially less risk for surgery than patients who received laser treatment,\u201d said Lloyd Paul Aiello, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Beetham Eye Institute at Joslin Diabetes Center and Professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School. \u201cThese findings will change the available treatment options for patients with PDR.\u201d\n\nDiabetic retinopathy damages blood vessels in the light-sensitive retina in the back of the eye. As the disease worsens, blood vessels can swell and lose their ability to function properly. Diabetic retinopathy becomes proliferative when lack of blood flow in the retina increases production of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which can stimulate the growth of new, abnormal blood vessels. These new vessels are prone to bleeding into the center of the eye, sometimes requiring a surgical procedure called a vitrectomy to clear the blood. The abnormal blood vessels can also cause scarring and retinal detachment. Untreated, PDR is associated with high risk of visual loss. Lucentis is among several drugs that block the effects of VEGF.\n\nDr. Aiello and George King, M.D., Chief Scientific Officer at Joslin Diabetes Center and Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, pioneered the study of VEGF in diabetic eye disease, beginning in the early 1990s. (Their work followed a distinguished Joslin tradition\u2014the basic laser photocoagulation technique was developed in the 1960s by Dr. Aiello\u2019s father, Lloyd M. Aiello, M.D., and grandfather, William P. Beetham, M.D.)\n\nAbout 7.7 million U.S. residents have diabetic retinopathy, a leading cause of blindness among working-age Americans. Among these, about 1.5 percent have progressed to PDR.\n\nThe DRCR.net enrolled 305 participants (394 eyes) with PDR in one or both eyes at 55 clinical sites across the country. Eyes were assigned randomly to treatment with Lucentis or laser. About half of the eyes assigned to the laser group required more than one round of laser treatment. In the other group, Lucentis was injected into the eye once per month for three consecutive months, and then as needed until the disease resolved or stabilized.\n\nBecause Lucentis is commonly injected to treat diabetic macular edema (DME)\u2014a build-up of fluid in the center of the retina\u2014the study permitted the use of Lucentis for DME in the laser group, if necessary. Slightly more than half (53 percent) of eyes in the laser group received Lucentis injections to treat DME. About 6 percent of eyes in the Lucentis group received laser therapy, mostly for issues other than DME.\n\nAt two years, vision in the Lucentis group improved by an average of about half a line on an eye chart, compared with virtually no change in the laser group.\n\nParticipants treated with laser generally lost substantial peripheral vision, but those given injections did not, emphasized Jennifer Sun, M.D., M.P.H., Associate Professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School and physician at the Beetham Eye Institute.\n\n\u201cThis was a clear benefit associated with the anti-VEGF medication,\u201d said Dr. Sun, who as the DRCR.net nationwide Protocol Working Investigator was instrumental in the study\u2019s development. \u201cMany of our patients who have laser treatment notice that they have more tunnel vision, which can lead to difficulties as they go about activities of daily life. The use of anti-VEGF treatment rather than laser for PDR could help prevent these symptoms.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the need for vitrectomy surgery was lower in the Lucentis group (8 of 191 eyes) than in the laser group (30 of 203 eyes).\n\nOverall, the drug\u2019s benefits are particularly clear for people with both PDR and DME. \u201cWe know that this drug will help treat both conditions at the same time, so this is an especially appealing treatment alternative for these patients,\u201d Dr. Aiello noted.\n\n\u201cLucentis should be considered a viable treatment option for people with PDR, especially for individuals needing anti-VEGF for DME,\u201d said Jeffrey G. Gross, M.D., of the Carolina Retina Center in Columbia, South Carolina, who chaired the clinical study.\n\nThe study also suggested that Lucentis may help prevent DME. Among people without this condition at the start of the study, only 9 percent of Lucentis-treated eyes developed it, compared with 28 percent in the laser group. Scientists will follow up on that result as the DRCR.net continues to track patients for a total of five years.\n\nA separate clinical trial, now getting underway, will examine whether anti-VEGF injections given at an earlier stage of diabetic eye disease can help prevent people from developing both DME and the sight-threatening PDR stage of the disease at all, Dr. Aiello said.\n\nThe trial reported today \u201cis a major study that may substantially change our approach to treatment of PDR,\u201d summed up Dr. Sun. \u201cLaser still has a role in the treatment of PDR for some patients, but anti-VEGF therapy gives us another tool in our search for better vision outcomes in our patients with diabetes.\u201d\n\nFounded in 1898, Joslin Diabetes Center is world-renowned for its deep expertise in diabetes treatment and research.

This new research analyzed data from multiple trials to determine the relative effectiveness of various nonsurgical treatments for knee OA. The treatments that were compared and ranked included acetaminophen; ibuprofen; intra-articular (IA) or joint injections of cortisone; platelet-rich plasma (PRP); hyaluronic acid (HA); several NSAIDs, such as naproxen, celecoxib, and diclofenac; and both oral and IA placebo.\n\n\"This is the first comprehensive mixed-comparison analysis comparing best-evidence scientific research and excluding lower quality studies that can bias the outcomes,\" said lead author and orthopaedic surgeon David Jevsevar, MD, MBA. \"Using a statistical ranking technique, we worked to provide evidence regarding which of the most common NSAIDs are most likely to decrease pain and improve function, and we attempted to fill in the gaps in evidence for more inconclusive treatments such as HA, PRP, and corticosteroids.\"\n\nAuthors analyzed 53 randomized controlled trials that examined knee OA treatments for at least 28 days and included a minimum of 30 participants per study group. Knee OA treatments were ranked on a scale of one to five, with one being the most effective. They found the following:\n\u2022 For pain reduction, cortisone injections provided the greatest short-term (4 to 6 weeks) pain relief, followed by ibuprofen, PRP injections, naproxen, and celecoxib.\n\u2022 Naproxen ranked the highest for probability for improving function, followed by diclofenac, celecoxib, ibuprofen, and PRP injections.\n\u2022 Naproxen was ranked the most effective individual knee OA treatment for improving both pain and function followed by cortisone injections, PRP injections, ibuprofen and celecoxib.\n\u2022 HA injections did not achieve a rank in the top five treatments for pain, function, or combined pain and function. An analysis of 12 articles also found that results with HA are not significantly different from those with IA placebo for treatment of knee OA.\n\n\"Because knee OA has both a high disease burden and high treatment costs, additional prospective studies using similar outcomes, timelines, and measures of clinically important changes are needed,\" explained Dr. Jevsevar. \"While the information in this analysis is helpful to physicians, patients also can benefit from these findings and use it with their doctors to weigh all possible treatment options.\"\n\nAlthough the use of NSAIDs for arthritic conditions such as knee OA has potential risks, including heart attack and stroke, existing evidence indicates that naproxen has less potential for adverse cardiovascular events.\n\nMore information about the AAOS and JAAOS\n\nFollow the AAOS on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram \n\nFollow the conversation about JAAOS on Twitter\n\nFrom the Department of Orthopaedics, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH (Dr. Jevsevar), American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, Rosemont, IL (Mr. Shores, Mr. Mullen, Ms. Schulte, and Dr. Cummins), and Franciscan Orthopedic Associates, Tacoma, WA (Dr. Brown).

Nevertheless, it raises hope that a simple, noninvasive intervention might go a long way towards countering the fatigue, poorer prognosis and impaired quality of life that can result from chemo-induced muscle mass loss.\n\n\"Fish oil may prevent loss of weight and muscle by interfering with some of the pathways that are altered in advanced cancer,\" study author Dr. Vera Mazurak, of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, said in a news release. \"This holds great promise, because currently there is no effective treatment for cancer-related malnutrition.\"\n\nMazurak and her colleagues report their observations in the Feb. 28 online edition of Cancer.\n\nTo explore the therapeutic potential of fish oil supplements, the authors offered 16 cancer patients undergoing an initial 10-week chemotherapy regimen a daily dose of 2.2 grams of a particular omega-3 fatty acid called eicosapentaenoic (EPA).\n\nWhile these patients took fish oil supplements throughout their chemotherapy treatment, a second group of 24 patients underwent the same regimen minus the fish oil.\n\nThe results: continual muscle and fat measurements revealed that the group that took no fish oil supplementation lost an average of just over 5 pounds; the supplement group lost no weight.\n\nWhat's more, blood analyses revealed that those in the fish oil group who had the biggest bump in bloodstream EPA concentrations also had the greatest muscle mass gains.\n\nSpecifically, nearly 70 percent of those in the fish oil group either kept their pre-chemo muscle mass or gained muscle. By comparison, less than 30 percent in the non-supplement group kept their original muscle mass.\n\nTotal fat tissue measurements were unaffected by fish oil supplementation, the team noted, and no side effects were observed.\n\nThe authors concluded that fish oil supplementation appears to be a safe and effective way to prevent malnutrition among cancer patients, and may ultimately prove to be of benefit for other groups of people, such as elderly patients who also face a significant ongoing risk for muscle loss.\n\nLona Sandon, a registered dietitian and assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Dallas, reacted with cautious optimism to the findings.\n\n\"Malnutrition is a big concern with cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiation,\" she noted. \"Because first of all they do have wasting from the cancer itself, which is very metabolically active and eats up your energy stores. And then with chemotherapy, there is some inflammation that's detrimental to the heart and muscle, as it can cause muscle breakdown. And preservation of lean muscle tissue, we know, leads to better outcomes.\"\n\n\"So certainly this does seem to be promising,\" Sandon said. \"And other similar studies have looked at omega-3 and muscle preservation and have also suggested that fish oil can act to prevent inflammation caused by both disease and hardcore medications, like chemotherapy agents.\"\n\n\"But I would caution that the amount of pure concentrated fish oil supplement the people in this study were given is a lot,\" she added. \"Much much more than any recommended dietary allowance, along the lines of two to three servings of fish per week.\"\n\nBut, she said, \"I would say this is certainly worthy of continuing research and exploration.

But that might be changing, at least when it comes to risk of death.\n\nThe body mass index, or BMI, associated with the lowest risk of death has increased since the 1970s, a study finds, from 23.7, in the \"normal\" weight category, to 27, which is deemed \"overweight.\"\n\nThat means a person who is 5-foot-8 could weigh 180 pounds and be in that epidemiological sweet spot, according to the NIH's online BMI calculator. The results were published Tuesday in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nThe researchers came to that conclusion by looking at data from three studies of people in Copenhagen, one from the 1970s, one from the 1990s and one from 2003-2013. More than 100,000 people were involved. Because Denmark has an excellent national health registry, they were able to pinpoint the cause of death for every single one of those people.\n\nThe risk of death for people who are obese, with a BMI of 30 or greater, also declined, to the point that it was on a par with some people of so-called \"normal\" weight.\n\nSo being fatter, at least a bit, may be healthier.\n\n\"I was surprised as a scientist to see how clear the result was,\" Borge Nordestgaard, a clinical professor and chief physician at Copenhagen University Hospital and senior author of the study, told Shots.\n\nSo he and his colleagues sliced and diced the data to see what could account for the shift. They looked at age, sex, smoking, cancer and heart disease. The most relevant was the decline in smoking since the 1970s. But when they looked at the mortality rates in nonsmokers who had never had cancer or heart disease, it also became associated with a higher BMI over time.\n\nSo what's going on?\n\n\"Now we get into the speculation part, right? I know you journalists always want that,\" Nordestgaard says. \"One option certainly is over these three decades we have become much better at treating the cardiovascular risk factors that come with overweight and obesity.\"\n\nThat includes treating high cholesterol with statins; treating high blood pressure with diet, exercise and an array of medications; and making concerted efforts to help people to control blood sugar.\n\nPeople in Denmark got heavier on average over the course of the study, as they have in the United States and most other countries. By 2013, 56 percent of the Danes had a BMI of 25 or higher. So you could think, OK, the new average is a heavier average.\n\nOr you could wonder if being a bit heavier somehow helps confer health benefits that affect longevity.\n\nResearchers have long known that people who are very thin tend to have a shorter life expectancy, often because they're dealing with cancer or other serious illnesses. The sweet spot on the BMI/longevity axis is typically somewhere near the middle. But there's not much data to back the notion that a bit more pudge is protective. \"This is total speculation,\" Nordestgaard says.\n\nThe BMI has been vilified as a poor measure of an individual's health. Someone who is big, fit and well-muscled, like a pro football player, can peg an obese BMI. And all of the people in this study are white, so that's a limitation. But the BMI, which is a general measure of body fat, has proven useful for thinking about the health of large groups of people, as in this study.\n\nNordestgaard and his colleagues are going to dig into this more in an effort to figure out what's going on, but he cautions that these kinds of data dives can take many months.\n\nBut this does raise the prospect of whether it may soon be time to tweak the official definition of normal, healthy weight.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "There were no apparent conflicts of interest.

One suggestion is to replace 5% of the flour in pizza dough with dried and granulated seaweed.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of premature death globally. Ironically, many of the pathologies leading to premature death from cardiovascular diseases are not only widespread, but they are preventable.\n\nOne way to prevent cardiovascular diseases is to avoid obesity and eat healthy, leaving the responsibility with the individual consumer.\n\nBut the responsibility should also be shared by society, argues University of Southern Denmark professor of biophysics, Ole G. Mouritsen, who has authored several books on seaweed as food.\n\nProfessor Mouritsen is the co-author of an article in the journal Phycologia reviewing existing knowledge on the health effects of 35 different seaweed species.\n\nIn the article the authors offer suggestions to how both individual consumers and the food industry can use seaweed to make our everyday meals healthier.\n\n\"Certain substances in seaweed may be important for reducing cardiovascular diseases. We think this knowledge should be available for society and also be put to use\", says Mouritsen.\n\nMany seaweed species have a variety of health benefits. They contain, among other things, beneficial proteins, antioxidants, minerals, trace elements, dietary fiber and polyunsaturated fatty acids.\n\nSeaweed's content of potassium salts does not led to high blood pressure - unlike the sodium salts, typically encountered in the processed food.\n\nAn important feature is also that the seaweed has umami - the fifth basic taste, which is known to promote satiety and hence regulate food intake in addition to reduce the craving for salt, sugar and fat.\n\n\"It is difficult to determine how much seaweed a person should consume to benefit from its good qualities. 5-10 grams of dried seaweed per day is my estimate\", says Professor Mouritsen.\n\nHe and the co-authors suggest that seaweed should be added fast food, thus making this type of food healthier. It can even enhance the flavor of the food, they argue. For example, dried and granulated seaweed can replace some of the flour when producing dry pasta, bread, pizza, snack bars, etc.\n\nIt is also possible to add seaweed to meat products and thereby provide the consumer with an increased intake of dietary fiber and antioxidants - or maybe the aim is lower cholesterol levels.\n\nIn the article Professor Mouritsen and his co-authors describe a study in which a group of overweight but otherwise healthy men were asked to taste bread with added dried seaweed from the species Ascophyllum nosodum. The men's reaction was that the bread tasted acceptable as long as the seaweed content was kept under 4%.\n\nBy eating bread containing 4% of dried seaweed the overweight men ingested more dietary fiber (4.5 g more fiber per. 100 g) than when they ate the control whole-meal bread. Another effect was that they consumed 16.4% less energy in the 24 hour period after eating the seaweed enriched bread.\n\n\"We know that many people have difficulty distinguishing between healthy and unhealthy food. By adding seaweed to processed foods we can make food healthier. In many cases we also get tastier food, and it may also help reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases\", the authors believe.\n\u2022 Seaweed contains only few calories, but is still rich in rich in essential amino acids, dietary fibers, minerals, trace elements, vitamins and polyunsaturated fats.\n\u2022 You can easily add up to 5% dried seaweed to a dough without losing its ability to raise.\n\u2022 Dried seaweed can be stored for months or years without loss of flavor and nutritional value.\n\u2022 Dried seaweed can be added to food as powder, granulate or pieces in pastries, egg dishes, mashed potatoes, dressings, or sprinkled on vegetables or fish dishes.\n\u2022 Powders and granulates can be used as a salt substitute.\n\u2022 Hijiki contains arsenic, which is carcinogenic and therefore some national food authorities recommend that you do not eat it. Despite these warnings, you can buy dried hijiki in many stores.\n\u2022 Some species may contain large amounts of iodine.\n\u2022 Never eat seaweed that is washed up on the beach.\n\nContact Professor Ole G.

The site was developed with Sense About Science [3], a UK charity that that equips people to make sense of scientific and medical claims in public discussion.\n\n\"The Ubble website allows anybody in the UK between forty and seventy years old to calculate their 'Ubble age' and their risk of dying within the next five years compared to the general population, using a simple set of a dozen or so questions,\" says study co-author Professor Erik Ingelsson from Uppsala University, Sweden. \"This is the first study of its kind which is based on a very large study sample, and is not limited to specific populations, single types of risk, or requiring laboratory testing.\" [4]\n\nTo create the score, Professor Ingelsson and Dr Andrea Ganna, from the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, analysed data collected between 2006 and 2010 from nearly half a million adults aged between 40 and 70 years from the UK Biobank [5]. They used a statistical survival model to assess the probability that 655 specific demographic, lifestyle, and health measurements could predict death from any cause and six specific causes, in men and women separately.\n\nThe results allow researchers to compare the predictive ability of a large number of health-related risk factors which were formerly studied separately and using different populations, although the predictive ability of risk factors does not necessarily imply they are causally related to the risk of dying.\n\nFor example, the research shows that self-reported information, such as usual walking pace and illness and injuries in the past 2 years, is generally a stronger predictor of death and survival than biological measurements, such as pulse rate and blood pressure. Surprisingly, self-reported walking pace is a stronger predictor of death risk in both men and women than smoking habits and other lifestyle measurements.\n\nSelf-rated overall health [6] emerged as the single most powerful predictor of death in men, and previous cancer diagnosis the strongest predictor in women (see figure 1 of the Article). When excluding individuals with serious diseases or disorders, smoking habits were the strongest predictors of mortality from any cause (figure 3).\n\nUsing these findings, the researchers then developed an easy-to-calculate risk score for an individual's risk of dying in the next 5 years, based on the most predictive self-reported information, including 13 questions for men and 11 for women. The performance of the score was validated in 35810 participants enrolled at two Scottish centres which were not used to develop the score, and was found to have around 80% accuracy in men and women (table 2). UK life tables and census information were used to calibrate the score for the overall UK population.\n\nAccording to study co-author Dr Ganna, \"The fact that the score can be measured online in a brief questionnaire, without any need for lab tests or physical examination, is an exciting development. We hope that our score might eventually enable doctors to quickly and easily identify their highest risk patients, although more research will be needed to determine whether it can be used in this way in a clinical setting. Of course, the score has a degree of uncertainty and shouldn't be seen as a deterministic prediction. For most people, a high risk of dying in the next five years can be reduced by increased physical activity, smoking cessation, and a healthy diet.\" [4]\n\nWriting in a linked Comment, Simon Thompson and Peter Willeit from the University of Cambridge in the UK say, \"One appealing aspect of the website is the representation of an individual's estimated 5 year mortality risk as what the authors call \"Ubble age\" (the age where the average risk in the population is most similar to the estimated risk of the individual); this concept is similar to that of heart age developed for communicating cardiovascular risk. Whether this will help individuals improve self-awareness of their health status, however, or only lead to so-called cyberchondria, is a moot point. Moreover, 5 year mortality is easier to predict than long-term morbidity, or quality of life and life expectancy, all of which are more important to individuals and to society.\"\n\nThis study was funded by Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation and the Swedish Research Council.\n\n[2] For preview login details for the Ubble website, please email daisy.barton@lancet.com.\n\n[3] See http://www. for more information.\n\n[4] Quotes direct from author and cannot be found in text of Article.\n\n[5] UK Biobank http://www. recruited half a million people aged between 40 and 69 years in 2006-10 from across the country.

There\u2019s no such thing as a blood test, cheek swab or other accepted biological marker so specialists must depend on parent and teacher reports, observations and play assessments. Figuring out a child's trajectory once he or she is diagnosed is just as challenging. The spectrum is wide and some are destined to be on the mild end and be very talkative, sometimes almost indistinguishable from those without the disorder in some settings, while others will suffer from a more severe form and have trouble being able to speak basic words.\n\nNow scientists believe that they have a way to distinguish between those paths, at least in terms of language ability, in the toddler years using brain imaging.\n\nIn an article published Thursday in the journal Neuron, scientists at the University of California-San Diego have found that children with autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, with good language outcomes have strikingly distinct patterns of brain activation as compared to those with poor language outcomes and typically developing toddlers.\n\n\"Why some toddlers with ASD get better and develop good language and others do not has been a mystery that is of the utmost importance to solve,\" Eric Courchesne, one of the study\u2019s authors and co-director of the University of California-San Diego's Autism Center, said in a statement.\n\nThe images of the children in the study -- MRIs of the brain -- were taken at 12 to 29 months while their language was assessed one to two years later at 30 to 48 months.\n\nSuch research has become critically important as the number of children diagnosed with autism has soared in recent decades to 1 in 68. Scientists have looked at numerous possible causes, from genetics to environmental exposure, but no definitive answers. Autism is considered by most experts to be a lifelong condition, but numerous studies have found that children's outcomes improve with early therapy. Hundreds of millions of dollars of state and federal funding are being spent each year to provide help to children and adults with autism and being able to pinpoint children at risk in the early years could help direct those public resources to where they could do the most good.\n\nBrain imaging has become a popular subject of research in recent years as the technology to be able to scan, store and analyze the terabytes of information in the pictures has become more affordable.

The balloons take up space in the stomach, which presumably makes people feel fuller faster, the FDA said in its announcement Tuesday.\n\nBut the device can only be used for six months at a time, and it is not likely to be an alternative for people who require lap-band surgery, stomach stapling or other forms of bariatric surgery, said Dr. Mitchell Roslin, chief of obesity surgery for Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\n\"It's going to be effective for short-term weight-loss,\" Roslin said, \"but there is still an overwhelming question whether these devices provide any long-term benefit for obesity.\"\n\n\"I don't think it's going to be part of the medical algorithm for treating obesity,\" he added. \"I think it's going to be for people who want to lose weight fairly rapidly.\"\n\nIn a clinical trial, the ReShape system helped people more than double their weight loss compared to those trying to lose weight through diet and exercise, an FDA news release said. That clinical trial was funded by the company that makes the ReShape system, according to a presentation from the Obesity Society annual meeting in Boston.\n\nThe device is available to obese people who often don't qualify for surgical weight-loss procedures, according to the FDA. Obese people who have a body-mass index (a rough estimate of body fat based on your height and weight) between 30 and 40 and at least one obesity-related health condition are eligible for the new procedure, the agency said. Obesity-related health conditions include high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol.\n\nIt's also intended for those who have been unsuccessful in trying to lose weight through diet and exercise alone, the agency said.\n\nDoctors insert the balloons through a scope snaked down the throat and into the stomach, and then fill them with saline containing a blue dye. It takes about eight minutes to place the balloons, and about 14 minutes to remove them, according to Dr. Jaime Ponce, medical director of the bariatric surgery program at Hamilton Medical Center in Dalton, Ga. Ponce was the principal investigator of the clinical trial on the ReShape system.\n\nThe device doesn't change the stomach's natural anatomy, according to the FDA. Patients are told to follow a medically supervised diet and exercise plan, to help them lose weight while they have the device in their stomach and to maintain weight loss after the device is removed.\n\nA pair of connected balloons are used because earlier single-balloon versions tended to dislodge and migrate down the digestive tract, blocking the bowels, Roslin explained.\n\nWith ReShape, if one of the balloons ruptures then the other balloon will keep it in the stomach. The blue dye that filled the balloon will turn a patient's urine blue, letting the person know that one of the balloons has ruptured. Doctors can then go back in and retrieve the entire device.\n\nNausea is a common side effect of the device. In the clinical trial, about 15 percent of patients had to have the balloons removed prematurely due to intolerable nausea, according to Ponce.\n\n\"The first few days are associated with a fair amount of nausea, and you will need some coaching to get through that,\" Roslin said.\n\nAnother troubling side effect is gastric ulcers caused by the balloons rubbing against the stomach wall. About 35 percent of patients in the clinical trial suffered ulcers, but researchers said most of the ulcers were small and superficial.\n\nRoslin also believes that, for now, patients will have to pay cash for the ReShape. \"It is not going to be reimbursed by insurance, at least for the first generation and certainly for the foreseeable future,\" he said.\n\nThe balloons have been available in Europe since 2011, where their average price is about $6,200, according to the manufacturer, ReShape Medical Inc. in California.\n\nThe people who initially will use the ReShape are people who can afford to pay for it out-of-pocket and need to drop some pounds quickly, Roslin said.\n\nIn the clinical trial, the 187 participants who used the device lost an average of more than 14 pounds, or about 7 percent of their total body weight. Patients who did not receive the device lost about half that amount of weight -- just over 3 percent of their total body weight, the FDA said.\n\nFor more information on how being overweight or obese affects your health, visit the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story identifies the device manufacturer, ReShape, as the financial sponsor of the clinical research on their own device. \u00a0And it includes extensive quotes with an obesity surgeon who provides expert perspective on some of the limitations of the intervention.\n\u00a0", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The Mediterranean diet includes lots of fish, plenty of fruits and vegetables, portions of whole grains, and very little meat. This classic diet does not exclude a dinnertime glass of wine, however, sugary drinks, fried food, and sweets are not on the menu. Scientists believe this style of eating offers some protection against mental aging, and, above all else, it is heart healthy.\n\nA new study of over 15,000 people in 39 countries explored the benefits of this diet for one special group: those already diagnosed with heart disease. Surprisingly, the results suggest it might be possible they can have their cake and eat it, too.\n\nParticipants eating a Mediterranean diet showed a lower risk of heart attack and stroke, the researchers discovered; yet, eating healthy food appeared to be more important than avoiding unhealthy foods identified as typical of a so-called Western diet, such as French fries, fatty red meats, and, yes, even cake. (Though diet names refer to regions, they are not precise.)\n\nLed by Professor Ralph Stewart from the University of Auckland, New Zealand, a team of researchers asked 15,482 older adults with stable coronary artery disease to complete a lifestyle questionnaire. With an average age of 67, each was a participant in GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s STABILITY drug trial, created to learn whether the drug reduced the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and deaths. Participants lived in Western and Eastern Europe, North and South America, and the Asia Pacific region.\n\nThey answered questions about their diet and reported how many times a week they consumed servings from separate food groups. Looking at their answers, researchers gave them points in either the Mediterranean diet or Western diet category.\n\nOver nearly four years, 1,588 (about 10 percent) of the study participants suffered either a heart attack or stroke, or died. Those who ate more foods in the Mediterranean diet category were 3.5 times less likely to experience one of these three events than people whose diets more closely resembled the Western standard.\n\nIn fact, every one-point increase in a participant\u2019s Mediterranean diet score was linked with a 7 percent reduction in risk of heart attack, stroke, or death. Look at it this way: if 100 people ate the highest proportion of Mediterranean foods and 100 ate the least, there would be three fewer heart attacks, strokes, or deaths among those who ate more foods from the Mediterranean diet. These findings held for every geographical region.\n\nNow here\u2019s the interesting part: eating more foods thought to be less healthy \u2014 those typical of Western diets \u2014did not link to an increase in heart attacks, strokes, or deaths. Eating more healthy foods was the key, even if some unhealthy foods were also consumed along the way.\n\nAccording to Stewart, the meaning behind the numbers is clear. Instead of avoiding unhealthy foods, people with weak hearts might focus more on consuming healthy foods. That said, Stewart notes his study has limitations, including a lack of strict guidelines about portion size and no measure of total calories.\n\nLong-standing American Heart Association guidelines recommend a diet primarily consisting of fruits, vegetables, fish, and other whole foods, with limited amounts of sodium, sugar, saturated fats, and refined carbohydrates.

Each method has pros and cons, but there is little clarity whether one might be more effective than the other. For the first time, researchers have shown that more patients live longer if treated with the combination of prostate removal plus radiation therapy. The research was published September 25th in the journal Cancer.\n\n\"There's a lot of debate about whether to remove the whole prostate and follow up with radiation therapy. Or, as a second option, to spare the prostate and treat it using radiation therapy plus hormone-blocking therapy,\" said senior author Grace Lu-Yao, PhD, Associate Director of Population Science at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center - Jefferson Health, one of only eight NCI-designated cancer centers nationwide with a prostate cancer program of excellence. \"Our study suggests that removing the prostate followed by adjuvant radiotherapy is associated with greater overall survival in men with prostate cancer.\"\n\nThe risks of prostate removal, or prostatectomy, are well known and include higher chance of developing incontinence and erectile dysfunction. There are some risks associated with radiation treatment and hormone therapy, but they are less common, and are typically thought to have a lower impact on quality of life. \"Prostatectomy is an unpopular treatment,\" said Lu-Yao. \"Our study showed that only six percent of men with high-risk cancer were treated with it.\" It's not just the risk of side effects.For some men, especially those who are not fit enough for the surgery, prostatectomy is not an option. However, this may be an option for some patients to reconsider.\"\n\nIn the largest population-based retrospective study to date, Dr. Lu-Yao and colleagues examined the records of 13,856 men in the Medicare-SEER registry diagnosed with locally advanced prostate cancer -- cancer growth that had not yet metastasized to distant sites in the body. Dr. Lu-Yao and colleagues looked at the patients who were treated either with prostatectomy plus adjuvant radiation as one group, and compared them to another group who were treated with radiation therapy plus hormone-blocking therapy. They matched the comparison groups by age, race and co-morbidity to control for factors that may influence patient outcomes, and analyzed which group did better 10 to 15 years after their procedures.\n\nThey found that 10 years after treatment, 89 percent of the prostate removal plus radiation group was still alive. That compared with the 74 percent survival at ten years in the group that received only radiation plus hormone therapy, amounting to a 15 percent survival advantage in the group that was treated with prostate removal.\n\n\"For high-risk prostate patients we started the use of aggressive radiation therapy after surgery 20 years ago,\" said Adam Dicker, Senior Vice President and Chair of the Department of Enterprise Radiation Oncology at Jefferson Health, who was not involved in the study. \"We recognized that it may have curative potential.\"\n\n\"However, the proportion of men undergoing prostatectomy plus radiation therapy decreased significantly over time and there were trade-offs for the survival advantages,\" said Dr. Lu-Yao. Men who received the combination of surgery and radiotherapy had higher rates of erectile dysfunction (28 percent vs 20 percent) and higher rates of urinary incontinence (49 percent vs 19 percent).\n\nAnother interesting finding from the research was that slightly more than half of men diagnosed with the disease did not receive combination therapies for their prostate cancer. \"Two modes of treatment are recommended by both United States and European guidelines for cancer treatment. It was surprising to see only 29 percent of patients received the recommended combination therapies, and as many as 20 percent are not getting any treatment six months after their diagnosis,\" said Dr. Lu-Yao. \"Our data can't tell us the reason for this deviation from guidelines and further studies are needed.\"\n\n\"One of the strengths of retrospective studies of patient data is that it reveals what happens in the real world, rather than the carefully controlled context of a clinical trial,\" said Dr. Lu-Yao. \"Our data is revealing the real-world practice as well as some of the advantages and disadvantages of those medical preferences.\"\n\n\"This important study demonstrates that many men with high-risk prostate cancer derive a survival advantage through a multi-modality approach to their disease. Several large clinical trials are nearing completion that should validate these retrospective findings of the benefits of primary radical prostatectomy followed by additional therapies such as adjuvant radiation,\" said Leonard Gomella, Chair of the Department of Urology at Jefferson (Philadelphia University + Thomas Jefferson University), who was not involved in this research.\n\nThe study was funded by the New Jersey Health Foundation, the National Cancer Institute (P30 CA-072720 and CA-116399 and the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey Biometrics Shared Resource.

For one thing, it can be the factor that sends someone to get a genetic test in the first place. For another, people in many parts of the world don\u2019t have access to genetic tests at all.\n\nThat\u2019s inspired years of effort to train a computer to do the same thing. Software that analyzes a patient\u2019s face for signs of disease could help clinicians better diagnose and treat people with genetic syndromes.\n\nSome older attempts at facial analysis relied on large, clunky scanners \u2014 a tool better suited to a lab, not the field. Now, in the era of smartphones, such efforts have a whole new promise. Face2Gene, a program developed by Boston-based startup FDNA, has a mobile app that clinicians can use to snap photos of their patients and get a list of syndromes they might have.\n\nMeanwhile, Muenke and his colleagues at the NIH last month published an important advance: the ability to diagnose disease in a non-Caucasian face.\n\nIt\u2019s a promising preliminary sign. But if facial recognition software is to be widely useful for diagnoses, software developers and geneticists will need to work together to overcome genetics\u2019 systemic blind spots.\n\nThe algorithms in general work on the same principles: measuring the size of facial features and their placement to detect patterns. They\u2019re both trained on databases of photographs doctors take of their patients. The NIH works with partners around the world to collect their photos; FDNA accepts photos uploaded to Face2Gene.\n\nBut they differ in a key way: Whereas the algorithm the NIH uses can predict if someone has a given genetic disorder, the Face2Gene algorithm spits out not diagnoses, but probabilities. The app describes photos as being a certain percent similar to photos of people with one of the 2,000 disorders for which Face2Gene has image data, based on the overall \u201clook\u201d of the face as well as the presence of certain features. However, the app won\u2019t give clinicians a yes or no answer to the question of, \u201cDoes my patient have a genetic disorder?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s intentional. Face2Gene is meant to be more like a search engine for diseases \u2014 a means to an end.\n\n\u201cWe are not a diagnostic tool, and we will never be a diagnostic tool,\u201d said FDNA CEO Dekel Gelbman.\n\nDrawing that bright line between Face2Gene and \u201ca diagnostic tool\u201d allows FDNA to stay compliant with FDA regulations governing mobile medical apps while avoiding some of the regulatory burden associated with smartphone-based diagnostic tools.\n\nThe algorithm the NIH uses \u2014 developed by scientists at Children\u2019s National Health System in Washington, D.C., \u2014 seems to work pretty well so far: In 129 cases of Down syndrome, it accurately detected the disorder 94 percent of the time. For DiGeorge syndrome, the numbers were even higher: It had a 95 percent accuracy rate across all 156 cases.\n\nFace2Gene declined to provide similar numbers for their technology. \u201cSince Face2Gene is a search and reference informational tool, the terms sensitivity and specificity are difficult to apply to our output,\u201d Gelbman cautioned.\n\nBut there\u2019s one big stumbling block for both of them, a problem that has dogged medical genetics for decades: Data for non-white populations is sorely lacking.\n\n\u201cIn every single textbook, the ones we had [when I trained] in Germany and the major textbooks here in the US, there are photos of individuals of northern European descent,\u201d Muenke said. \u201cWhen I told this to my boss, he said there have to be atlases for children from diverse backgrounds. And there aren\u2019t. There just aren\u2019t.\u201d (Today there is that resource, based on Muenke and the NIH\u2019s work.)\n\nSo diagnosing diseases from a face alone presents an additional challenge in countries where the majority of the population isn\u2019t of northern European descent, because some facial areas that vary with ethnic background can often overlap with areas that signify a genetic disorder. Eventually, the software will also have to be able to tackle people with mixed ethnic backgrounds, too. \u201cWe have thought about it but haven\u2019t gone there yet,\u201d Muenke said.\n\nFor example, children with Down syndrome often have flat nasal bridges \u2014 as do typically developing African or African-American children. Across different races and ethnicities of children there were only two reliable identifiers that could be used to diagnose Down syndrome \u2014 the angles between landmark points on the child\u2019s nose and eye, according to a paper Muenke and Marius Linguraru at Children\u2019s National published with their colleagues earlier this year. All of the other \u201ctypical\u201d features weren\u2019t significantly more likely to show up when children were compared to ethnically matched controls.\n\nIn fact, using a Caucasian face as a reference can sometimes be the least representative choice. \u201cOne of the findings that I\u2019m very interested in [in] our recent study was that the population that we found to be most different from the others, in terms of facial patterns characteristic of DiGeorge syndrome, was the Caucasian population,\u201d Linguraru said.\n\nTo continue to fix this problem, both the NIH and Face2Gene need help from more researchers who can upload more patients\u2019 faces \u2014 but that\u2019s easier said than done. Confirming a suspected disorder with genetic tests is standard practice today, and there are no genetic labs based in Africa registered in the NIH\u2019s Genetic Testing Registry. Asia and South America are also relatively underserved.\n\nThose numbers also reflect the general patterns of distribution for medical geneticists. \u201cMost practitioners are located in North America and Europe,\u201d Gelbman said. Nigeria, for example, doesn\u2019t have a single medical geneticist in the entire country.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that might change, with time and effort. In addition to his work as a researcher, Muenke directs a program that brings health care professionals from developing countries to the US for a month-long crash course in medical genetics. (The program is funded by the NIH\u2019s Fogarty International Center; President Trump eliminated funding for the center in his 2018 \u201cskinny\u201d budget proposal announced in March.)\n\nFor now, both algorithms have shown that they can handle a diverse patient set. FDNA scientists published a paper in January showing that their algorithm could better identify Down syndrome after being trained with a more diverse set of faces, and Muenke and Linguraru have also published papers this year demonstrating their algorithm\u2019s ability to identify genetic disorders correctly in children across a variety of ethnic backgrounds.\n\nAs both groups work on recruiting more researchers, they are also working to push their tech forward. FDNA is working on establishing partnerships with pharmaceutical companies to start their commercial outreach. In theory, these partnerships could contribute to precision medicine efforts or help companies develop new therapies for rare diseases.\n\nMeanwhile, Linguraru has his eyes on eventual FDA approval for the algorithm the NIH has used. The ultimate goal would be a simple tool that any doctor could use anywhere to get fast results and better diagnose their patients.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "It\u2019s not exactly clear where the NIH work and the company\u2019s work begin and end.

Doctors often give Lucentis less frequently, but even if that regimen produces good results, patients must still get checkups every month to make sure their vision is not deteriorating.\n\nRegeneron\u2019s drug, which is called VEGF Trap-Eye, \u201cgives us the opportunity to not have to see them monthly,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Heier of Boston, an investigator in one of the trials and a consultant to Regeneron. That would be \u201cvery meaningful to patients and their families,\u201d he said.\n\nRegeneron and its partner, Bayer, said they planned to apply for approval of the drug in the first half of 2011.\n\nThe two similar trials involved a total of 2,457 patients who were randomly chosen to receive either Lucentis every four weeks or VEGF Trap-Eye either every four weeks or every eight weeks. In the eight-week arm, the first three doses were given every four weeks.\n\nAfter a year, roughly 95 percent of the patients in all the arms of the trial maintained their vision, meaning their ability to read an eye chart declined by no more than 15 letters, or three lines.\n\nVEGF Trap-Eye was also \u201cnoninferior\u201d to Lucentis in terms of the average change in vision after one year. Lucentis recipients had a mean gain of 8.1 letters and 9.4 letters in the two trials. Those getting Regeneron\u2019s drug every eight weeks had gains of 7.9 letters and 8.9 letters.\n\nRegeneron said the two drugs were equally safe.\n\nBoth VEGF Trap-Eye and Lucentis block a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor that causes blood vessels to grow and leak into the eye.\n\nVEGF Trap-Eye could become the first big product for Regeneron, which was founded in 1988 and is based in Tarrytown, N.Y. It sells one drug for a rare disease and has garnered hundreds of millions of dollars from licensing deals with big pharmaceutical companies.\n\nRegeneron\u2019s drug is likely to face competition from off-label use of Genentech\u2019s cancer drug Avastin. When used in the eye, Avastin costs about $50 a dose, compared with about $2,000 for Lucentis. Still, even with such low-priced competition, Lucentis has sales exceeding $2 billion globally.\n\nMeanwhile, Advanced Cell Technology, of Marlborough, Mass., said it would test its stem cell therapy on 12 adults with severe vision loss caused by Stargardt\u2019s, an inherited disease.\n\nThe company has turned human embryonic stem cells into retinal pigment epithelial cells, which will be surgically implanted into the eye. The hope is that the implanted cells will replace those injured by the disease.\n\nHuman embryonic stem cells are controversial because their creation usually entails the destruction of human embryos, although Advanced Cell Technology is working on a technique to avoid that.\n\nEmbryonic cells can also form tumors if injected into the body. Dr. Robert Lanza, chief scientist at Advanced Cell, said the company had to prove to the F.D.A. that its retinal cells contained virtually no residual embryonic stem cells. It took a year for the company to get clearance for the trial from the F.D.A.\n\nIt is likely to be several years before such a treatment can reach the market, if it works. Still, even starting the trial could be a boost to Advanced Cell, which often makes headlines but has struggled to raise money. Its shares closed at 5 cents on Friday.\n\nDr. Peter J. Francis, an associate professor at the Oregon Health and Science University, which will be a site for the trial, says the eye is a good place to test stem cell therapy because it is accessible. Also, he said, there is less chance of rejection of the implanted cells because the eye is shielded somewhat from the body\u2019s immune system.\n\nThere is no treatment for Stargardt\u2019s, which affects more than 25,000 people in the United States. The disease is usually diagnosed during childhood and it causes a loss of central vision, though not usually peripheral vision.\n\nRyan Rapoport of Newcastle, Wash., who has the disease, \u201cbasically went from normal vision to legally blind in seven months,\u201d said his father, Darrin.\n\nRyan, now 10, cannot be in the trial because, for safety reasons, it is confined to adults.

Notably, participants did not take any MS medications after receiving HDIT/HCT. Other studies have indicated that currently available MS drugs have lower success rates.\n\nThe trial, called HALT-MS, was sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, and conducted by the NIAID-funded Immune Tolerance Network (ITN). The researchers published three-year results from the study in December 2014, and the final five-year results appear online Feb. 1 in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.\n\n\u201cThese extended findings suggest that one-time treatment with HDIT/HCT may be substantially more effective than long-term treatment with the best available medications for people with a certain type of MS,\u201d said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. \u201cThese encouraging results support the development of a large, randomized trial to directly compare HDIT/HCT to standard of care for this often-debilitating disease.\u201d\n\nMS symptoms vary widely and may include motor and speech difficulties, weakness, fatigue and chronic pain. The most common form of MS is relapsing-remitting MS, which is characterized by periods of mild or no symptoms interspersed with symptom flare-ups or relapses. Over years, the disease can worsen and shift to a progressive form.\n\nIn HALT-MS, researchers tested the safety, efficacy and durability of HDIT/HCT in 24 volunteers aged 26 to 52 years with relapsing-remitting MS who, despite taking clinically available medications, experienced active inflammation, evidenced by frequent severe relapses, and worsened neurological disability.\n\nThe experimental treatment aims to suppress active disease and prevent further disability by removing disease-causing cells and resetting the immune system. During the procedure, doctors collect a participant\u2019s blood-forming stem cells, give the participant high-dose chemotherapy to deplete the immune system, and return the participant\u2019s own stem cells to rebuild the immune system. The treatment carries some risks, and many participants experienced the expected side effects of HDIT/HCT, such as infections. Three participants died during the study; none of the deaths were related to the study treatment.\n\nFive years after HDIT/HCT, most trial participants remained in remission, and their MS had stabilized. In addition, some participants showed improvements, such as recovery of mobility or other physical capabilities.\n\n\u201cAlthough further evaluation of the benefits and risks of HDIT/HCT is needed, these five-year results suggest the promise of this treatment for inducing long-term, sustained remissions of poor-prognosis relapsing-remitting MS,\u201d said Richard Nash, M.D., of Colorado Blood Cancer Institute and Presbyterian-St. Luke\u2019s Hospital. Dr. Nash served as principal investigator of the HALT-MS study.\n\n\u201cIf these findings are confirmed in larger studies, HDIT/HCT may become a potential therapeutic option for patients with active relapsing-remitting MS, particularly those who do not respond to existing therapies,\u201d said Daniel Rotrosen, M.D., director of NIAID\u2019s Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation.\n\nThis work was sponsored by NIAID, NIH, and conducted by the ITN under award number AI109565 and NIAID-funded statistical and clinical coordinating centers under award number AI117870.

These limited screening criteria also missed more racial and ethnic minorities, most notably Asians.\n\nFailing to screen high-risk adults could lead to delayed treatments to prevent type 2 diabetes or manage the condition for those who already have it, possibly contributing to a worsening of the diabetes epidemic. Prediabetes and diabetes affect half of U.S. adults with an estimated cost of $327 billion per year.\n\nThe United States Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) currently recommends that physicians screen patients for dysglycemia (prediabetes or type 2 diabetes) when they are 40 to 70 years old and are overweight or obese. By following this recommendation, 53 percent of patients who had prediabetes or type 2 diabetes would not be screened. The study showed that screening patients using an expanded set of risk factors, which the USPSTF suggests but does not formally recommend, would identify most cases of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.\n\nOnly 23 percent of patients with prediabetes or diabetes would be missed if expanded screening criteria were used to make screening decisions, the study found. The expanded criteria include a family history of diabetes, history of gestational diabetes or polycystic ovarian syndrome or non-white race or ethnicity.\n\n\"This seems like a no-brainer to screen patients who have any of these additional risk factors,\" said lead author Dr. Matthew O'Brien, assistant professor of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. \"By demonstrating how well these expanded criteria work in identifying patients with prediabetes and diabetes, we're proposing a better path for the USPSTF to strengthen its screening guidelines.\"\n\nThe study was published today, Friday, April 13, in the Journal of General Internal Medicine. O'Brien will be presenting his findings today at the Society for General Internal Medicine conference in Denver, Colorado. This is the first study to report how these expanded screening criteria would perform in practice among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults.\n\nThe USPSTF has come under scrutiny for other screening recommendations, most notably for breast cancer. But there has been little attention focused on this group's most recent diabetes screening guideline.\n\nIntensive lifestyle programs and some medications have been proven to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes among adults with prediabetes. A large volume of research over the last three decades has demonstrated that treating type 2 diabetes prevents life-threatening complications such as heart attacks, strokes and kidney failure.\n\n\"The earlier patients are diagnosed with these conditions, the sooner they can begin to combat them,\" O'Brien said.\n\nAfrican-Americans and Latinos develop type 2 diabetes at younger ages, so waiting until they are 40 years old to screen them is problematic, O'Brien said. In the study, 50 percent of whites with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes were identified using the limited criteria compared to only 48 percent of African-Americans and only 44 percent of Latinos.\n\nAsians are at high risk of developing diabetes even at a healthy weight. By following the limited guidelines and only screening patients who are overweight or obese, approximately 30 percent of Asians with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes would be identified. That would leave 70 percent of Asians with prediabetes or diabetes undiagnosed until their next screening test, which could occur years later.\n\nThe study also touches on the financial implications of these guidelines. Under a provision in the Affordable Care Act, all services recommended by the USPSTF must be fully covered by insurers. But O'Brien said it is unclear whether insurers will be required to pay for diabetes screening if patients only meet the expanded criteria.\n\n\"This could be a particular problem for people of low socioeconomic status who are at high risk of developing diabetes and may be unable to pay for a screening test,\" O'Brien said.\n\nThe study was conducted collaboratively with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), using data collected every year from a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. It builds on findings from a previous study O'Brien conducted that incorporated electronic health record data from 50,515 adult primary care patients at community health centers in the Midwest and Southwest between 2008 and 2013.\n\nOther Northwestern authors are senior author Dr. Ronald Ackermann and co-authors Mercedes Carnethon and Dr. Namratha Kandula.
