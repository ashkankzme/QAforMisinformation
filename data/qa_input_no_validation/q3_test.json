[{"article": "TUESDAY, Dec. 21, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- The recreational drug known as ecstasy may have a medicinal role to play in helping people who have trouble connecting to others socially, new research suggests.\n\nIn a study involving a small group of healthy people, investigators found that the drug -- also known as MDMA -- prompted heightened feelings of friendliness, playfulness and love, and induced a lowering of the guard that might have therapeutic uses for improving social interactions.\n\nYet the closeness it sparks might not be result in deep and lasting connections.\n\nThe findings \"suggest that MDMA enhances sociability, but does not necessarily increase empathy,\" noted study author Gillinder Bedi, an assistant professor of clinical psychology at Columbia University and a research scientist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute in New York City.\n\nThe study, funded by the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse and conducted at the Human Behavioral Pharmacology Laboratory at the University of Chicago, was published in the Dec. 15 issue of Biological Psychiatry.\n\nIn July, another study reported that MDMA might be useful in treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), based on the drug's apparent boosting of the ability to cope with grief by helping to control fears without numbing people emotionally.\n\nMDMA is part of a family of so-called \"club drugs,\" which are popular with some teens and young at all night dances or \"raves.\" These drugs, which are often used in combination with alcohol, have potentially life-threatening effects, according to the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nThe newest study explored the effects of MDMA on 21 healthy volunteers, nine women and 12 men aged 18 to 38. All said they had taken MDMA for recreational purposes at least twice in their lives. They were randomly assigned to take either a low or moderate dose of MDMA, methamphetamine or a sugar pill during four sessions in about a three-week period.\n\nEach session lasted at least 4.5 hours, or until all effects of the drug had worn off. During that time, participants stayed in a laboratory testing room, and social interaction was limited to contact with a research assistant who helped administer cognitive exams.\n\nA moderate dose of MDMA was found to significantly increase feelings of loving, friendliness and playfulness, the researchers said, whereas the low dose of MDMA boosted feelings of loneliness.\n\nThe moderate dose also prompted a drop in the ability to accurately recognize fear in other people's faces, determined by having the participants look at a range of photos, the study found, but it did not affect the ability to perceive the shifting cues in a person's eyes or voice, determined by having the participants listen to a series of audio clips.\n\nThis effect, the Bedi and his team suggested, could help people improve their social skills by shielding them from the negative emotions of others.\n\nIn a twist, the researchers also found that methamphetamine similarly prompted feelings of friendliness and loving. In fact, those who took the drug actually rated themselves as more sociable than those taking MDMA.\n\nAs a warning, the researchers noted that MDMA might indeed facilitate socializing, but it also might impair a person's perceptive abilities and thus prompt risk-taking.\n\nNonetheless, the researchers suggested that MDMA might help people with PTSD as well those with autism, schizophrenia or antisocial personality disorder cope with a variety of emotional difficulties.\n\n\"More controlled research is needed to establish whether MDMA can safely and effectively add to psychotherapy for some conditions and, if so, what the mechanisms of these effects are,\" Bedi said.\n\nDr. Michael Mithoefer, author of the earlier study on MDMA and PTSD, also urged further exploration of the medicinal potential of the drug.\n\n\"First, I think it's very important that we investigate potential new therapies, and that we shouldn't be dissuaded from doing that just because something can be misused,\" he said. \"Many things can be life-threatening or dangerous if used incorrectly. But if used in the right setting wisely, many things can also be helpful. So there's no question we should be looking into how this might benefit people who are suffering.\"\n\nThe results of his earlier study, which had focused on the moderate dose of MDMA, \"were very promising,\" Mithoefer said. \"Now, there's a long way to go between that and proving effectiveness. But it certainly suggests, just as these findings suggest, that the question merits further investigation.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse has more on MDMA.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story said that the drug \u201cmight impair a person\u2019s perceptive abilities and thus prompt risk-taking.\u201d\u00a0 Is that the only known risk of taking MDMA?", "answer": 0}, {"article": "MONDAY, Feb. 27, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Middle-aged and elderly adults who regularly eat foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids may slow the mental decline that leads to dementia, according to a new study.\n\nResearchers found that people with the highest blood levels of these essential fatty acidsfound in fish such as salmon and tunawere more likely to perform well on tests of mental functioning and to experience less age-related brain shrinkage.\n\n\"We feel fatty-acid consumption exerts a beneficial effect on brain aging by promoting vascular health,\" said the study's lead author, Dr. Zaldy Tan, associate professor at the Easton Center for Alzheimer's Disease Research and the division of geriatrics at the University of California, Los Angeles. This might include reducing blood pressure and inflammation, he added.\n\nPrevious research linked dementia risk with the amount of omega-3 fatty acids in blood plasma, which reflects how much people had eaten in the past few days. But in the current work, researchers could estimate the amount of omega-3s that participants had consumed in the past several months by looking at how much had built up in their red blood cells.\n\n\"This represents their average intake of fatty acids, not just a snapshot,\" Tan said.\n\nThe study, published in the Feb. 28 issue of the journal Neurology, did not prove that omega-3 fatty acids prevent mental decline, merely that there may be an association between consumption of fatty acids and brain health.\n\nFor the study, researchers measured the red blood cell level of fatty acids in 1,575 dementia-free people whose average age was 67. About three months later, participants underwent mental-functioning tests and MRI scans that examined brain size and blood supply in the brain.\n\nThe participants were in the Framingham Offspring Study, which is predominately white. Whether the association would apply to other ethnic and racial groups needs to be explored, the authors said.\n\nThe researchers found that those with the lowest levels of omega-3s had worse scores on tests of visual memory, attention and abstract thinking than people who ranked in the top 75 percent for fatty-acid levels.\n\nAdults in the bottom 25 percent also tended to have smaller brain volume overall. The decrease in brain volume was enough to make their brains appear two years older than those of people in the top three-quarters for fatty-acid levels.\n\nBrain scans also showed signs of less blood supply in the brains of people with the lowest omega-3 levels. This suggests they may play a role in promoting general vascular, or blood vessel, health in the brain, similar to how they are thought to help heart health, rather than acting on just one brain area, Tan said.\n\nThe researchers took into account various health and lifestyle factors, including age, education and body mass index, to explore whether other differences among the people with low levels of omega-3s could help explain their more rapid brain aging.\n\nBut after controlling for those risk factors, \"the difference [in brain aging] is still there so we conclude that omega-3 fatty acids likely explain them,\" Tan said.\n\nTan added, however, that it remains possible that factors they did not control for, such as fruit and vegetable consumption, are really responsible for the brain benefits. Another possibility is that the slight mental decline that the people in the older brain group were experiencing caused them to eat less healthy omega-3-rich foods, instead of vice versa.\n\n\"This is a strengthening of the argument that people with less [omega-3 fatty acids] have higher risk of dementia,\" said Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, associate professor of clinical neurology at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City.\n\nBut questions remain over whether fatty-acid levels really influence changes in brain size, Scarmeas added. A clinical trial comparing high and low intake of omega-3s in relation to brain imaging would help answer those questions, he said.\n\nIn the meantime, fish is \"a good prescription for other things and we have a hint it might be helpful for the brain,\" Scarmeas said.\n\nThat the current study reported a difference in brain health between people with omega-3 fatty-acid levels in the bottom 25 percent and top 75 percent suggests that there is a threshold level of consumption to attain brain gains.\n\nA previous study in which participants filled out food surveys found decreased risk of vascular brain problems among those who ate at least three servings of fish a week.\n\nFind out more about brain health at the Alzheimer's Association.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The harms of eating fish are not in question, although there is some concern that certain species high in mercury can be harmful for pregnant women and children.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "A comparison between less-expensive, over-the-counter hearing assistance devices and a conventional hearing aid found that some of these devices were associated with improvements in hearing similar to the hearing aid, according to a study published by JAMA.\n\nPresently, hearing aids can only be purchased in the United States through a licensed professional, with an average cost of $4,700 for two hearing aids (uncovered by Medicare). According to nationally representative estimates, less than 20 percent of adults with hearing loss report hearing aid use.

DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research at McMaster have developed the first widely protective vaccine against chlamydia, a common STI that is mostly asymptomatic but impacts 113 million people around the world each year and can result in infertility.\n\nIn a study, recently published in the journal Vaccine, the researchers show that a novel chlamydial antigen known as BD584 is a potential vaccine candidate for the most common species of chlamydia known as Chlamydia trachomatis.\n\nAs most C. trachomatis infections are asymptomatic, chlamydia can often go untreated and lead to upper genital tract infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and infertility. This is why the promise of a vaccine would be extremely beneficial, says David Bulir, co-author of the study.\n\n\"Vaccine development efforts in the past three decades have been unproductive and there is no vaccine approved for use in humans,\" said Bulir, who just finished his PhD in medical sciences at McMaster.\n\n\"Vaccination would be the best way to way to prevent a chlamydia infection, and this study has identified important new antigens which could be used as part of a vaccine to prevent or eliminate the damaging reproductive consequences of untreated infections.\"\n\nIn the research team's study, BD584 was able to reduce chlamydial shedding - a symptom of C. trachomatis - by 95 per cent. The antigen also decreased hydrosalpinx, another C. trachomatis symptom which involves fallopian tubes being blocked with serous fluids, by 87.5 per cent.\n\nThe results look very promising, said senior author James Mahony, a professor of Pathology and Molecular Medicine for McMaster's Michael G.

This is easy and painless and does not require highly trained health professionals to administer, and that makes it an inexpensive solution for developing nations,\" he said.\n\nThe next step is more testing for effectiveness against different strains of Chlamydia and in different formulations.

Have you felt down, depressed or hopeless?\n\nIf the patient answers yes to one or both, a questionnaire is recommended to determine if the patient is depressed and the severity. If depression is indicated, the patient may need to see a professional qualified in treating depression, the panel said, adding that treatment options include antidepressants, seeing a psychotherapist and exercise.\n\n\u201cSome physicians are qualified to treat it \u2014 others may be more comfortable referring the problem to a qualified mental health professional,\u201d Froelicher said.\n\nPsychiatrist Michelle Riba said the statement\u2019s emphasis on frequent screening is important.\n\n\u201cWhat you want to see in a particular patient is how they do over time,\u201d said Riba, past president of the American Psychiatric Association, which has endorsed the heart association\u2019s recommendations.\n\nOne doctor said screening isn\u2019t enough; patients need close monitoring to make sure they get help.\n\n\u201cA lot of patients with depression don\u2019t follow up on it,\u201d said Dr. Mary Whooley, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not on the panel.\n\nBarbara Forman, 62, struggled with depression after her double bypass about five years ago.

Experts note that studies presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nIn the study, Sapkota's team tested the saliva of 22 people with Alzheimer's disease, 25 people with what's known as mild cognitive impairment (a decline in memory and thinking that's sometimes a precursor to dementia), as well as 35 people whose mental skills were normal for their age.\n\nThey found that the saliva of people with Alzheimer's had different levels of certain substances compared to the saliva of healthy people or those with mild cognitive impairment.\n\nExperts agreed that the findings held promise, but much more research will be needed.\n\n\"This is a very preliminary study with a small number of subjects and the results are far from conclusive,\" said Dr. Allison Reiss, head of the Inflammation Section at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, N.Y.\n\nShe believes the current study lacks information on possible confounding factors -- things such as \"coexisting illnesses, medications, hydration state, tobacco use and multiple other variables\" that could influence what's found in the saliva samples.\n\n\"There are many gaps in the evidence,\" Reiss said. \"It is uncertain whether the strength and consistency of the relationship between these metabolites [in saliva] and Alzheimer's risk will be maintained in a large multicenter study.\"\n\nStill, Dr. Paul Wright, chair of neurology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., said the research \"is still in its infancy but very promising.\"\n\nIf a saliva test lives up to its promise, one advantage is \"the ease of obtaining a sample,\" he said.\n\nBut that convenience also brings its own problems, Wright added.

But there were nine instances of very low blood sugar among children who had the standard treatment, according to the study, conducted by researchers in Britain at the University of Cambridge.\n\n\u201cThis is an important step in diabetes control because it shows that, with this system, people can sleep safely with minimized risk of hypoglycemia,\u201d said Dr. Eric Renard, a professor of diabetology at Montpellier University Hospital in Montpellier, France.\n\nDr. Renard, whose commentary accompanied the study in The Lancet, has been a consultant and speaker for several makers of diabetic products, he said.\n\nIndustry analysts have estimated that 10 to 15 percent of Americans with Type 1 diabetes \u2014 perhaps 400,000 of them \u2014 use either a continuous glucose monitor or an insulin pump, or in some cases both.\n\nOver the last decade, the makers of medical devices have developed techniques that have widened diabetes management options beyond pricking the finger several times a day to test blood glucose levels. Companies like DexCom in San Diego now make small continuous glucose monitors whose sensors can be embedded in the skin. And Animas, a division of Johnson & Johnson, makes programmable pumps the size of a cellphone that administer insulin doses through a tiny implantable catheter.\n\nThese new-generation devices represent a significant advance over older products, said Aaron J. Kowalski, the assistant senior vice president of glucose control research at the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation in Manhattan, one of the largest nonprofit patient advocacy and research groups for diabetes.\n\nEven so, Dr. Kowalski said, using separate devices that are not designed to work in concert poses limits to treatment, particularly overnight. If a diabetic person\u2019s blood sugar drops during the night and the glucose monitor alarm goes off, for example, that person may not wake up and the preprogrammed pump, operating separately, could continue to deliver insulin, making the problem worse, Dr. Kowalski said. (His group was one of the sponsors of the Lancet study.)\n\nResearchers in Europe and the United States have been racing to develop a fully automated system for Type 1 diabetes that would wirelessly connect an external glucose monitor with an insulin delivery device. Based on algorithms like the ones used in the Lancet study, the devices would continually monitor glucose levels, calibrate insulin dosages and then dispense insulin in real time \u2014 automating a delivery task performed by a nurse in the study.\n\nResearchers call such a hypothetical integrated system an \u201cartificial pancreas\u201d because it would mimic the way a healthy pancreas works, sensing glucose and dispensing insulin in the right dose at the right time. The goal is a portable system that could be worn on a belt and would be no larger than a cellphone.\n\nLast month, as part of an effort called the Artificial Pancreas Project, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation announced an $8 million partnership with Animas to develop a first-generation combined system. Meanwhile the European Union has just started its own project, called Artificial Pancreas at Home, which involves a grant of 10.5 million euros to research teams across Europe to create a prototype combined device over the next four years, Dr. Renard said.\n\nThe new study in The Lancet, proponents say, represents a proof-of-concept milestone in the quest to develop such a system.\n\n\u201cThe significance is in showing that the existing devices, which are available commercially, can be combined to create the first version of an artificial pancreas,\u201d said Dr. Roman Hovorka, the lead author of the study.\n\nDr. Hovorka, a principal research associate in pediatrics at Cambridge, said he had been a consultant or speaker for several makers of diabetes products.\n\nAlthough the Lancet study was small \u2014 only 17 children completed the entire protocol \u2014 it is significant because it demonstrated that a computer algorithm could safely interpret glucose data and calculate appropriate insulin doses for a pump, he said.\n\nThe study not only indicated that the algorithm system prevented very low glucose overnight, Dr. Hovorka said, but it also indicated that the experimental system was better able to keep blood glucose in an acceptable range.\n\nAfter midnight, about 80 percent of the measured glucose levels fell in a target range in children treated with the computer-adjusted system \u2014 compared to only 35 percent in the target range for those treated with a standard preprogrammed pump system, according to the study.\n\nStill, while the overall results were statistically significant, the study was not large enough to attain statistical significance in each of its separate arms. Those branches of the study examined how children fared after eating meals or after exercising \u2014 factors which can affect glucose levels.\n\nAnd the experimental combined system itself was not fully automated. To ensure that the experimental algorithm did not recommend unsafe doses, a nurse read the computer-generated dosing suggestions and then adjusted the patients\u2019 insulin pumps.\n\nIndeed, even if device makers are able to develop fully automated prototypes of combination systems, they are likely to face regulatory hurdles, analysts said, and would have to factor in product liability concerns.\n\n\u201cThis is something that companies have been striving to do for years, and as computer chip technology evolves, it gets closer,\u201d said Rick Wise, an analyst at Leerink Swann, a health care investment bank. \u201cBut you have to appreciate how exquisitely reliable an artificial pancreas would have to be to read glucose correctly and dispense insulin correctly.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The Times waited until the last 3 paragraphs of an 1,100-word story to hint\u00a0that an automated system could deliver unsafe doses of insulin.

Its device, powered by a small air compressor that can be carried in a backpack, has been implanted in more than 800 patients as a bridge before transplant.\n\nAbiomed, a company based in Danvers, Mass., makes a self-contained total artificial heart, the electrical-powered AbioCor. The United States Food and Drug Administration has designated the AbioCor as a \u201chumanitarian use device,\u201d meaning its use is restricted to people who are ineligible for transplants and would otherwise be facing imminent death.\n\nOthers are in development. In the United States, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, a unit of the National Institutes of Health, is supporting efforts by two separate groups, one led by Dr. O. H. Frazier of the Texas Heart Institute in Houston, the other by Dr. Leonard A. R. Golding of the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nAnother device is being developed by scientists at the Helmholtz-Institute for Biomedical Engineering at the University of Aachen in Germany.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a major need for a permanent, total artificial heart,\u201d Laman A. Gray Jr., the University of Louisville professor of surgery who implanted the first AbioCor heart in 2001, said.\n\nCiting World Health Organization data that shows heart disease is the world\u2019s leading cause of death, Mr. Conviti, the Carmat chief executive, estimated the potential market at \u201ca minimum\u201d of 100,000 patients a year in the United States and Europe.

Novack is also the BGU Gussie Krupp Chair in Internal Medicine.\n\n\"After monitoring patients 65 and older for six months, we found medical cannabis treatment significantly relieves pain and improves quality of life for seniors with minimal side effects reported.\"\n\nThis older population represents a growing segment of medical cannabis users, ranging from approximately seven percent to more than 33 percent, depending on the country. Recent U.S. polls indicate Americans over 65 represent 14 percent of the total population and use more than 30 percent of all prescription drugs, including highly addictive painkillers.\n\nBGU researchers surveyed 2,736 patients 65 years and older who received medical cannabis through \"Tikun Olam,\" the largest Israeli medical cannabis supplier. More than 60 percent were prescribed medical cannabis due to the pain, particularly pain associated with cancer. After six months of treatment, more than 93 percent of 901 respondents reported their pain dropped from a median of eight to four on a 10-point scale. Close to 60 percent of patients who originally reported \"bad\" or \"very bad\" quality of life upgraded to \"good\" or \"very good\" after six months. More than 70 percent of patients surveyed reported moderate to significant improvement in their condition.\n\nThe most commonly reported adverse effects were dizziness (9.7 percent) and dry mouth (7.1 percent). After six months, more than 18 percent of patients surveyed had stopped using opioid analgesics or had reduced their dosage.\n\nAll patients received a prescription after consulting with a doctor who prescribed treatment. More than 33 percent of patients used cannabis-infused oil; approximately 24 percent inhaled therapy by smoking, and approximately six percent used vaporization.\n\nWhile the researchers state their findings to date indicate cannabis may decrease dependence on prescription medicines, including opioids, more evidence-based data from this special, aging population is imperative.\n\nThe researchers in the study also include, Ran Abuhasira, a BGU Ph.D. candidate working in the Soroka Clinical Research Center, Lihi Bar-Lev Schleider of \"Tikun Olam,\" and Prof. Raphael Mechoulam of Hebrew University.

These include medical history and symptoms, and a physical exam in which a doctor will listen to a patient's heart and lung sounds, and check ankles, feet, legs and abdomen for signs of fluid buildup. Blood tests and an electrocardiogram can help confirm that heart failure exists.\n\nIn the new study, to gauge how well the noninvasive breath test could identify heart failure, the team collected exhaled breath samples from 41 patients who had been admitted as in-patients to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nOf those, 25 had been admitted with a primary diagnosis of \"acute decompensated heart failure\" while another 16 patients had shown no signs of heart failure but did have other cardiovascular issues. A single breath sample was obtained from each of the patients within 24 hours of admission, as well as from an additional 36 patients with acute decompensated heart failure as an independent point of comparison.\n\nWithin two hours of collection, all the samples were subject to the breath test analysis, which relied upon \"mass spectrometry\" technology to scan the samples for their molecular and chemical compound content. Some of those compounds had been pegged as potential telltale signs of heart failure.\n\nThe result: The breath test correctly identified all the patients with heart failure, clearly distinguishing them from those cardiac cases where heart failure was not an issue.\n\nDr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that if further research were able to establish its effectiveness, a breath-driven tool for identifying heart failure would be a helpful diagnostic innovation -- but more so in a doctor's office or clinic than in the hospital.\n\n\"If it is clear that it is highly reliable and specific and sensitive, then yes, it would be a welcome advance,\" he said. \"But I would say it would be perhaps more helpful for primary care physicians in an outpatient setting, because that is where it's most challenging to identify heart failure. Today a diagnosis in that environment is based on a patient's history and exam, but symptoms for heart failure can easily overlap with a lot of other diagnoses. And the blood work that would be taken in a doctor's office might not come back until the next day, delaying identification,\" he noted.\n\n\"So a breath test would be most useful in that kind of challenging situation,\" Fonarow said. \"But in an emergency room, while there are challenges as well, bedside blood tests are much more readily drawn and quickly analyzed so you can often get the results in minutes. So there may be potentially less of a role for a breath test in that kind of setting.\"\n\nStudy author Dweik added that the test is \"theoretically cheap. But of course we're still early in the process of exploring its potential. This study is really a proof of concept. There is much more work that needs to be done to get it to the point where it would become widely available.\"\n\nFor more on heart failure, visit the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story misses the mark here.

And so the current message is to replace saturated fat with unsaturated fat, and in so doing, consume a moderate-fat diet, not too much, and also not too little,\u201d Kris-Etherton told NBC News.\n\nKris-Etherton and colleagues did an intensive study with 45 typical Americans \u2013 all overweight or obese, but with healthy cholesterol and blood pressure levels.\n\nIt\u2019s tough to test diets in real life, because people eat so many different things, but the team controlled what everyone ate, feeding them carefully calibrated diets. One was a lower-fat diet without avocado, another was a moderate-fat diet without avocado, and the third added one avocado per day to the moderate-fat diet.\n\nThe two moderate-fat diets looked a lot like the average American diet, with about a third of calories coming from fat. The lower fat diet provided 24 percent of calories from fat.\n\nEveryone spent five weeks on each diet. No one lost weight, but their low-density lipoprotein (LDL or \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol) levels changed.\n\n\u201cAll diets decreased LDL cholesterol, the main lipid risk factor for cardiovascular disease. But the diet with the avocado decreased LDL cholesterol the most,\u201d Kris-Etherton said.\n\nAmericans are advised to keep total cholesterol below 200 and preferably below 180. LDL should be below 100.\n\nWhile they were eating the avocado-a-day diet, the volunteers saw their LDL go down by more than 13 points compared to their usual levels, Kris-Etherton\u2019s team reported in the Journal of the American Heart Association.\n\nLDL was 8.3 points lower on the moderate-fat diet without the avocado and 7.4 points less on the lower-fat diet.\n\nThe volunteers all ate Hass avocados, which have bumpy green skin. The Hass Avocado Board helped pay for the research, which was also funded by the U.S. government.\n\nIn addition to monounsaturated fats, the avocados contain fiber, phytosterols and polyphenols \u2013 all of which can help lower cholesterol. Avocados also contain natural sugars that may help regulate blood sugar.\n\n\u201cWe need to focus on getting people to eat a heart-healthy diet that includes avocados and other nutrient-rich food sources of better fats,\u201d Kris-Etherton said.\n\n\u201cAll the foods were exactly the same, except the avocado versus oils that were high in monounsaturated fat on the moderate-fat diet. So that was the only difference between the two diets, which then tells us that it's the avocado that has additional benefits which are beyond the unsaturated fat.\u201d\n\nThe findings are similar to a batch of studies that showed people who were given olive oil and nuts and told to add them to their diets ended up healthier. They were less likely to have strokes or heart attacks, and they were less likely to die over a period of years than people who didn\u2019t get the extra oils.\n\nSaturated fat \u2013 the kind found in meat and butter \u2013 has a different chemical structure from the unsaturated fats found in plant products. Repeated studies have shown it raises the risk of heart disease.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe studied avocados but maybe a lot of other fruits and vegetables have these bioactive components which have additional cholesterol-lowering effects,\u201d Kris-Etherton said. \u201cAnd certainly there's an emerging research base showing that some of these bioactive components may affect another lipoprotein particle favorably, like high-density lipoprotein. I think we need to stay tuned for that. \u201c\n\nAmericans may not be used to eating avocado but Kris-Etherton says it\u2019s easy to add.\n\n\u201cConsumers can include avocados in their diet in salads. They can include avocados on top of a sandwich, or in a sandwich. They can make guacamole and use vegetables rather than chips as the dip,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI love guacamole and with my recipe, I'll use avocados, cilantro, lime juice and garlic... and then sometimes I'll put salsa in, or red pepper flakes.\u201d\n\nBut like anything, too much of a good thing can be harmful. Avocados are definitely not low-calorie food.\n\n\u201cOne avocado has around 200 to 250 calories. So I would strongly urge people not to just add an avocado a day to their diet but they have to substitute nutrient-poor calories, which are so popular in the U.S. diet.,\u201d Kris-Etherton said.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story explicitly states that \u201ctoo much of a good thing can be harmful,\u201d explaining that avocados are high in calories.

Our results could help millions of people globally reduce their blood pressure and reduce their risk of heart attack or stroke.\"\n\nThe researchers tested an entirely new way of treating hypertension by giving patients three drugs, each at half dose, in a single pill for early treatment of high blood pressure. Traditionally patients begin treatment with one drug at a very low dose, which is increased over time with additional drugs added and increased in dosage to try to reach target.\n\nDr Webster added: \"Patients are brought back at frequent intervals to see if they are meeting their targets with multiple visits required to tailor their treatments and dosage. This is not only time inefficient, it's costly. We also know that many doctors and patients find it too complicated and often don't stick to the process. This new approach is much simpler and it works.\"\n\nThe trial, which was conducted in Sri Lanka, enrolled 700 patients with an average age of 56 and blood pressure of 154/90 mm Hg.\n\nPatients were randomly assigned to receive either the combination pill or usual care - their doctor's choice of blood pressure lowering medication. The Triple Pill, consisted of the blood pressure medications telmisartan (20 mg), amlodipine (2.5 mg), and chlorthalidone (12.5 mg).\n\nCompared with patients receiving usual care, a significantly higher proportion of patients receiving the Triple Pill achieved their target blood pressure of 140/90 or less (with lower targets of 130/80 for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease).\n\nAt six months, 83 percent of participants in the Triple Pill group were still receiving the combination pill compared to the majority of patients in the usual-care group still receiving only one and only one third receiving two or more blood-pressure-lowering drugs.\n\nProfessor Anushka Patel, Principal Investigator of the trial and Chief Scientist at The George Institute, said this was big improvement. \"The World Heart Federation has set an ambitious goal that by 2025 there will be a 25 per cent reduction in blood pressure levels globally.

Some are so new, clinical trials are still testing their efficacy and safety for human use.\n\nThese trials form the basis of the Cambridge research that was published Tuesday in the journal Molecular Psychiatry\n\nBased on previous findings about depression, the team looked at the side effects experienced by patients given anti-cytokine drugs in 20 separate studies. All the participants had chronic autoimmune inflammatory diseases, which occur when healthy cells are mistaken for infected cells, causing the immune system to attack the body and leading to inflammation.\n\nAnti-cytokine drugs \"dampen down inflammation by blocking the actions of specific inflammatory cytokines ... with 'surgical precision' and are now routinely used for treating patients who respond inadequately to standard treatments for inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and Crohn's disease both in the US and Europe,\" explained Dr. Golam Khandaker, a clinical lecturer in Cambridge's department of psychiatry and lead author of the new study.\n\nUsing data from the 20 studies, Khandaker and his colleagues found that anti-cytokine drugs improved symptoms of depression, regardless of whether they lessened the symptoms of physical illness.\n\n\"The findings suggest that inflammation may contribute to the pathogenesis of depression,\" Khandaker said. The findings also suggest that \"anti-inflammatory drugs may be helpful in treating patients with depression who are chronically inflamed.\"\n\nThe immune system acts like a thermostat, turned down low most of the time but cranked up when we have an infection, according to Khandaker. In some people, the thermostat is always set slightly higher, behaving as if they have a persistent low-level infection.\n\nFor the current report, Khandaker and his colleagues looked at studies of drugs blocking specific cytokines.\n\nKhandaker said that five of the 20 studies focused on one specific cytokine. All five showed the same result, that blocking the action of this cytokine to reduce inflammation lessened symptoms of depression.\n\nTwo clinical trials examined by Khandaker focused on another drug blocking the action of a different cytokine, and both studies showed it improved symptoms of depression.\n\nLooking to the future\n\n\"Evidence at this point suggests that cytokine antagonists -- which are much more specific in their anti-inflammatory effects than drugs like aspirin -- show modest antidepressant effects in individuals with depression and increased inflammation,\" said Raison, who did not participate in in Khandaker's research.\n\nThough it's still too early to prescribe these drugs to depressed patients, Khandaker believes that anti-inflammatory drugs may offer hope to people who find current antidepressants ineffective.\n\n\"We need more studies,\" he said, particularly research involving patients with depression who are inflamed but healthy to investigate the effect of these drugs on depression.

U.S. experts familiar with the study call it interesting but say the treatment needs more study and wonder if it would catch on in the U.S.\n\nWhile some previous research has found acupuncture for lazy eye effective, the researchers couldn't find a study that directly compared acupuncture with conventional treatments such as patching. So Dennis Lam, MD, a researcher at the Joint Shantou International Eye Center of Shantou University and Chinese University of Hong Kong, and his colleagues evaluated 88 children, ages 7 to 12, with the condition known as anisometropic amblyopia, in which there is a difference in the degree of nearsightedness or farsightedness between the two eyes. They assigned 43 children to the acupuncture group, and they received five treatments a week. Acupuncturists used five different points in the head, face, hand, and leg. The children were instructed to do an hour per day of near-vision activities such as homework or computer work. Another 45 children wore a patch over their normal eye for two hours daily, a typical regimen, and were also asked to do an hour of near-vision activity a day.\n\nAt 15 weeks, visual acuity with eyeglasses improved by about 1.8 lines on the vision chart in the patched eyes and 2.3 lines in those who had acupuncture. An improvement of two lines or more occurred in nearly 67% of those in the patching group but nearly 76% of those in the acupuncture group. Ambylopia was evaluated as resolved in nearly 17% of patched eyes but nearly 42% of the acupuncture group. ''These results suggest that the treatment effect of acupuncture is equivalent to that of patching for anisometropic amblyopia in older children,\" Lam writes. But at 25 weeks, the resolution rates were similar in the two groups: 30% of the patched group and 42% of the acupuncture group.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "This study did not report significant adverse effects with either the patch or with acupuncture.

Patz, Jr., M.D., the James and Alice Chen Professor of Radiology at Duke and lead author of a study published online March 21, 2016 in The Lancet Oncology journal. \"Not screening patients annually could save millions in health care costs and spare patients the radiation exposure and the downstream effects of false positive screenings.\"\n\nPatz and colleagues analyzed data from the National Lung Screening Trial, a large prospective study that randomly assigned former smokers to either receive three annual low-dose CT scans or three chest radiographs for the early detection of lung cancer. Patients were ages 55-74 who had smoked for the equivalent of 30 years (one pack a day for 30 years, two packs a day for 15 years, etc.).\n\nThe researchers identified study participants in the CT-scan group whose initial screening was negative. They then compared those patients to other CT-scan recipients whose screenings detected an abnormality to assess any differences in lung cancer incidence and lung cancer-specific deaths.\n\nOf the initial 19,066 participants with a negative initial LDCT scan, 444 (2 percent) were diagnosed with lung cancer at the time of the last available follow-up. In the first year after a negative screen and before the scheduled first annual screen, 17 patients (0.09 percent of all initial negative LDCT participants) were diagnosed with lung cancer.\n\nAn additional 75 patients (0.4 percent of the initial negative group) were diagnosed with lung cancer between the first and second annual screening. The incidence of lung cancer at the first screen among those who were initially negative was 0.34 percent, compared to 1 percent of patients who were diagnosed during the baseline screening.\n\nThe researchers determined that eliminating the first annual screening after the initial negative test might have resulted in, at most, an additional 28 lung cancer deaths in the LDCT group (186 vs. 212 deaths per 100,000 per years) over the course of the study.\n\n\"Our analysis suggests that annual screens may not be warranted for patients who have had an initial negative scan, and future risk prediction and cost-effectiveness models could incorporate these data to improve screening guidelines,\" Patz said.\n\nHe added that improving the accuracy of LDCT screening for lung cancer would also significantly reduce the number of annual screens.

All of the trials reviewed had \"major limitations,\" such as having too few patients, relying on parental reports of symptoms, or the study design (such as not being double-blinded).\n\n\"The notion that any form of complementary and alternative medicine is effective for infantile colic currently is not supported from the evidence from the included randomized clinical trials,\" the researchers from the United Kingdom wrote. \"Additional replications are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.\"\n\nBut because fennel extract, certain herbal teas and sugar water are generally safe, and because the research does suggest babies may benefit, pediatricians said they would feel comfortable recommending them to parents.\n\n\"It's reasonable for parents to consider those kinds of interventions for which there is some suggestion of benefit but no known risks,\" said Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York.\n\nThe study, published in the April print issue of Pediatrics, appears online March 28.\n\nColic usually starts when a baby is about three weeks old, said Dr. Ari Brown, a pediatrician in Austin, Texas, and author of the Expecting 411 book series. Colic is usually defined as excessive and inconsolable crying for at least three hours a day for more than three days a week over more than three weeks.\n\n\"It's miserable for both baby and the parents,\" Brown said. \"And although we've been studying it for years, no one has figured out what the cause is, which makes it all the more difficult to treat.\"\n\nIn the United States, between 5 and 19 percent of infants are estimated to have colic, according to background information in the article.\n\nBecause pediatricians can't offer parents much help with it -- for the most part, babies grow out of colic in time -- desperate parents often turn to alternative or complementary treatments, according to the study.\n\nIn the review, the study authors searched various databases of medical research and chose 15 randomized clinical trials involving alternative treatments for colic. The studies were published between 1991 and 2008, came from 10 different countries and included a total of 944 children.\n\nSeveral studies looked at spinal manipulation by a chiropractor. In three of those studies, parents reported their children cried significantly less afterwards. But those studies were small and flawed, so no conclusions can be made about the technique, according to the new review.\n\nThree studies looked at herbal supplements. One found improvement in infants given fennel extract compared to infants given a placebo; another found that infants given a tea containing chamomile, vervain, licorice, fennel and balm-mint seemed to work; while a third found infants given a tea containing fennel, lemon balm and chamomile cried less than infants given a placebo.\n\nFennel, an intestinal \"antispasmodic,\" may increase the speed at which food moves through the intestine, Brown said. This may help if the underlying cause of colic is cramping or discomfort due to an immature digestive tract, although that is just a theory, Brown added.\n\nTwo studies looked at giving babies solutions of sugar water, which some researchers believe has pain-killing properties. The parents of babies given sugar water reported significantly less crying. (If parents want to try it, they could deliver sugar water in a dropper, or put a small amount in a bottle, Adesman said.)\n\nA study of probiotics, which are reputed to help digestion, found that 95 percent of infants given L. reuteria probiotics seemed to reduce their average crying time compared to 7 percent of babies given simethicone, which is marketed to relieve gas under the brand names Mylicon and PediaCare Infants' Gas Relief.\n\n\"This is pertinent given that simethicone is considered the best available and most commonly prescribed treatment for colic, although it previously has been shown to be no more effective than the placebo,\" according to the authors.\n\nBrown said the strength of that finding suggests L. reuteria is worth further study.\n\nOne study found no difference in improvement of symptoms between infants whose parents were taught to do infant massage compared to infants put in a crib that vibrated. Nor did soy-enriched formula seem to help.\n\nA small study of babies given reflexology showed some improvement, but there was no difference in whether the reflexology targeted the feet, which are considered to be therapeutic for colic, or other parts of the body.\n\nThis implies the improvement may \"have more to do with the therapeutic effect of touch than the actual therapy itself,\" Dr. Edzard Ernst, of the department of complementary medicine at Peninsula Medical School, Universities of Exeter and Plymouth, in the United Kingdom, and colleagues wrote in the report.\n\nThe Nemours Foundation has more on colic.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not quantify the potential harms, but it makes it clear that the remedies most often used by parents have no significant side effects.

But researchers say it can also improve vision in people with DME, a common form of diabetic retinopathy.\n\nThe study of 691 patients with DME found that 50 percent of those who received Lucentis eye injections, plus laser treatment if necessary, had substantial improvement in vision one year after treatment, compared with 28 percent of patients who received laser treatment alone.

The patients had been recruited and treated with the virus in England by a team led by Dr. Amit C. Nathwani of University College London; researchers at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia monitored their immune reactions.\n\nHemophilia B is caused by a defect in the gene for Factor IX. Fatal if untreated, the disease occurs almost only in men because the Factor IX gene lies on the X chromosome, of which men have only a single copy.\n\nWomen who carry a defective gene on one X chromosome can compensate with the good copy on their other X chromosome, but they bequeath the defective copy to half their children. About one in 30,000 of newborn boys have the disease, with about 3,000 patients in the United States.\n\nDr. Nathwani and his team reported that they treated the patients by infusing the delivery virus into their veins. The virus homes in on the cells of the liver, and the gene it carries then churns out correct copies of Factor IX. A single injection enabled the patients to produce small amounts of Factor IX, enough that four of the six could stop the usual treatment, injections of Factor IX concentrate prepared from donated blood. The other two patients continued to need concentrate, but less frequently.\n\nTreating a patient with concentrate costs $300,000 a year, with a possible lifetime cost of $20 million, but the single required injection of the new delivery virus costs just $30,000, Dr. Katherine P. Ponder of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis notes in her commentary in The New England Journal of Medicine, calling the trial \u201ca landmark study.\u201d\n\nThe patients have continued to produce their own Factor IX for up to 22 months, said Dr. Edward G. D. Tuddenham, director of the Hemophilia Center at the Royal Free Hospital in London. One patient, a geologist, had a good response at first, but his level of Factor IX has declined to 1 percent of normal, the level at which the disease kicks in.\n\n\u201cWe attribute this to the fact that he had an inflammation, and although we treated it promptly, we should have been quicker off the mark,\u201d Dr. Tuddenham said.\n\nThe patient cannot be injected again with the same virus because his immune system is now primed to attack it. \u201cHe\u2019s very philosophic about it, but he\u2019s a scientist, and his motivation is to help the science,\u201d Dr. Tuddenham said.\n\nTwenty more patients will be treated to assess the best dose of the virus, the goal being the highest dose that does not set off an immune system attack, Dr. Tuddenham said. \u201cWe are pretty close to the sweet spot,\u201d he said. If all goes well, a genetic treatment for hemophilia B \u201ccould be available for widespread use in a couple of years.\u201d\n\nIn a trial in 2006, a patient injected with a corrective gene produced his own Factor IX but only for 10 weeks. The designer of that treatment, Dr. Katherine A. High of Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the new therapy had worked because the delivery virus had been made more efficient and because the research team had treated the patients with steroids to suppress immune system attacks on the virus.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s incredibly exciting, and I say that even though these people are my competitors,\u201d she said. Dr. High is listed as a co-author of the report because her laboratory helped monitor the patients and provided proof for regulators that the virus would not insert its human gene into the patients\u2019 sperm and make the change hereditary.\n\nA serious problem with other delivery viruses is that they insert themselves randomly into chromosomes, sometimes disrupting a gene. The virus used by Dr. Nathwani\u2019s team, known as adeno-associated virus-8, generally stays outside the chromosomes, so it should not present this problem. Still, patients will need to be monitored for liver cancer, a small possibility that has been observed in mice.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a showstopper, but it\u2019s a critical safety issue that has to be assessed,\u201d Dr. High said.\n\nPatients have little or no immunity to the adeno-associated virus, which infects rhesus monkeys. The virus has a propensity for making liver cells its target, which is good for the therapy because these cells are the natural producers of Factor IX. However, liver cells do not live forever and slowly replenish themselves, possibly limiting how long the therapy will last.\n\nAbout 80 percent of hemophilia cases are of the type known as hemophilia A, which is caused by defects in a different blood-clotting agent, Factor VIII.

The first group were also more likely to be employed and have control over household spending.

Half of all patients are children. Epilepsy can result from brain injury, but in most cases the cause is unknown and may be genetic. Refractory epilepsy, its intractable form, and the medications with which doctors attempt to treat it can cause lifelong problems with learning, memory and behavior.\n\nAn epileptic seizure occurs when large groups of neurons in the brain begin firing uncontrollably, disrupting the balance of electrical activity and causing changes in mental function, motor function and behavior. It\u2019s not known what sets off a seizure, but lately scientists like Dr. Devinsky have been gathering evidence that inflammation, the immune system\u2019s response to injuries or foreign organisms, plays a pivotal role.\n\nScientists have known since the 1950s that inflammation is involved in a particularly vicious brain disorder called Rasmussen\u2019s encephalitis, which starts seizures and usually affects children. Inflammation inflicts such severe damage to the brain that the standard treatment for the condition is hemispherectomy \u2014 the surgical removal of one of the brain\u2019s hemispheres. Some researchers also suspect an inflammatory link to another form of epilepsy, infantile spasms, because children with the disease respond to ACTH, a hormone produced in the pituitary gland with strong anti-inflammatory effects.\n\nEleonora Aronica, a neuropathologist at the University of Amsterdam, has found signs of inflammation in autopsy specimens and surgical resections from patients with a wide range of epilepsies. Annamaria Vezzani, a neuroscientist at the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan, has induced epilepsy in mice and rats by injecting kainic acid into their brains, and has observed the activation of a cellular pathway linked to inflammation before and during seizures.\n\nThe amount of inflammation in the brain correlates with the frequency of seizures, she also has found. \u201cThis is a novel finding,\u201d Dr. Vezzani said in an interview. \u201cIt was not known that inflammation was a common feature of different types of epilepsy.\u201d\n\nNormal brain function is regulated by the glial cells, which protect neurons and induce an inflammatory response if the brain is injured. But this response also can contribute to seizures, some experts believe, either because components of the immune system stimulate neurons or because the glial cells\u2019 capacity to regulate the brain is diminished when they become \u201cdistracted\u201d by an injury. As Dr. Devinsky noted, seizures in turn may produce further inflammation, perpetuating the cycle.\n\nNow Dr. Vezzani and colleagues are testing a molecule called VX-765 that disrupts the inflammatory process she discovered. In one study, high doses of the drug reduced the number of seizures by about two-thirds in mice with treatment-resistant epilepsy.\n\nSixty patients enrolled in a subsequent trial did not experience a statistically significant improvement after taking VX-765 for six weeks, but they did begin to experience fewer seizures at the end of the trial.\n\nThe drug is now the subject of a Phase 2 trial involving 400 patients. \u201cAnti-inflammatory therapies could at least supplement, and perhaps replace, anticonvulsants,\u201d said Dr. Jacqueline French, a neurologist at the N.Y.U. Comprehensive Epilepsy Center who is leading the new trial.\n\nReplacing anticonvulsants is not merely an end in itself. Although they give many epileptics a better quality of life, they do not affect the course of the disease, only its symptoms. Researchers hope that anti-inflammatories may help ameliorate epilepsy\u2019s underlying causes. \u201cGiving a medication that could treat the epilepsy, as opposed to treating the seizure, would be absolutely novel,\u201d Dr. French said.\n\nBut there are dangers to this approach. Steroids \u2014 potent anti-inflammatories that some doctors are using for experimental treatments \u2014 can have harmful long-term side effects. And it remains unclear whether inflammation might be implicated in all forms of epilepsy or which patients might benefit from anti-inflammatory treatment.\n\n\u201cLike any new field, there\u2019s a lot of enthusiasm and almost a bit of religion involved,\u201d said Dr. Tallie Z. Baram, an epilepsy expert at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cThe challenge for the next few years is to find out the limitations, the boundaries, the real mechanisms.\u201d\n\nStill, whatever the role of inflammation in epilepsy, Elisa Moller says that anti-inflammatories were a miracle intervention for her son.

So much metformin is taken in the United States \u2014 some 72 million prescriptions were written for it in 2013 \u2014 that a recent study found higher trace levels of it (presumably from the urine of people taking it) in Lake Michigan than of any other drug, including caffeine.\n\nBut Price, a science and medical reporter in Oakland, Calif., doesn\u2019t have Type 2 diabetes. She has Type 1, the far less common form of the disease, which requires lifelong treatment with insulin, to compensate for her body\u2019s failure to produce enough of the hormone. However, she had read studies indicating that metformin combined with insulin might help Type 1 diabetics, too. Moreover, the drug was being studied in clinical trials as a way to lower the risk of cancer, heart disease and dementia \u2014 not just for diabetics, but for everyone.\n\nFor Price, there was yet another possible benefit \u2014 as a treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome, an endocrine disorder that doctors thought might explain the difficulty she and her husband had had conceiving.\n\nSure enough, a month and a half after she had started taking metformin pills and even as she was enjoying the benefits of better blood-sugar control, Price became pregnant, eventually giving birth to a girl.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still taking metformin along with my insulin,\u201d said Price, 36, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes 14 years ago. \u201cI remember eating Mexican food one night, which can be a potential disaster for people with diabetes because of the carbs, but I noticed I needed only two-thirds to a half of the insulin I normally needed.\u201d\n\nSynthesized in the 1920s, metformin was first approved for treatment of Type 2 diabetes in the United Kingdom in 1958. It took until 1995 to get approval in the United States after a potentially fatal disorder linked to a similar drug was found to be rarely if ever associated with metformin.\n\nUnlike insulin shots, which help Type 1 diabetics break down sugar and starches in the blood, metformin lowers blood-sugar levels primarily by squelching the liver\u2019s tendency to release stored-up sugar into the bloodstream. Keeping that extra sugar (actually a form of sugar called glucose) out of the blood helps to maintain normal blood-sugar levels, thereby preventing such long-term complications as blindness, kidney failure and lower-limb amputation.\n\nAbout 29 million people in the United States have diabetes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 90 percent of them have Type 2, in which their bodies slowly fail to respond to normal levels of insulin, forcing their pancreas to produce so much that it\u2019s eventually exhausted. The estimated 2.5 million with Type 1, in contrast, lose their ability to produce insulin, usually within a matter of months, due to an autoimmune attack by the body on itself.\n\nToday, the range of ailments being targeted by metformin, a prescription drug sold under such names as Glucophage, Glumetza, Fortamet and Riomet, all share one characteristic: They are diseases related to aging.\n\n\u201cMetformin actually lowers the rate of cell turnover,\u201d said Michael Pollak, who has been studying metformin\u2019s effects on pancreatic cancer as chairman of oncology at McGill University in Montreal. \u201cIt makes cells divide less quickly. The rate-of-living theory defines aging as the number of cell divisions you undergo since you were a fertilized egg. If the theory is true, then people who age more gracefully have a slower rate of cell division. The question is whether the rate-of-living theory is operational in mammals.\u201d\n\nPollak says that none of the most exciting possible benefits for the drug have yet been proved in randomized clinical trials of non-diabetics. For now, the evidence suggesting benefits is limited to large studies of diabetics that have found, on average that those who take metformin tend to have lower rates of cancer, heart disease and dementia, and to live longer overall than those who take other drugs for diabetes. Those effects have also been seen in animal studies. But such evidence often does not pan out in human studies.\n\nAt a medical meeting in May, Pollak reported disappointing results from his first randomized, placebo-controlled trial of metformin for people with pancreatic cancer. \u201cIt yielded no benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cPlain old metformin given in the same dose as we do for Type 2 diabetes doesn\u2019t seem to be a breakthrough for cancer, at least for pancreatic cancer.\u201d\n\nMany other metformin clinical trials are underway for breast, colorectal, endometrial and other cancers.\n\nFor heart disease, the benefit of metformin over most other drugs for Type 2 diabetics has been seen repeatedly in clinical trials. For people without diabetes, only one study has been published, finding no apparent effect after 18 months. As with cancer, however, other studies are underway.\n\nFor dementia, which people with Type 2 diabetes have double the risk of developing compared with non-diabetics, metformin has been found in a number of studies to cut that risk substantially.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of excitement about metformin and dementia,\u201d said Rachel Whitmer, an epidemiologist at Kaiser Permanente in California.\n\nIn 2013, Whitmer presented the results of a study of about 15,000 people newly prescribed a medication for Type 2 diabetes: By the end of the five-year study, those who received metformin had a 40 percent lower risk of having developed dementia than those prescribed sulfonylureas, another common type of diabetes drug.\n\nBut, Whitmer notes, \u201cI don\u2019t think the story is complete. There needs to be more work in this area with all drugs for diabetes.\u201d\n\nFor Type 1 diabetes, researchers at the University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine published a study in May in which they added either a low dose of metformin or placebo pills to the insulin regimen of 74 adolescents. Those who received metformin lost weight \u2014 generally a benefit for those with diabetes \u2014 and needed less insulin after six months. Those who received the placebo needed more insulin than at the beginning of the study and saw their blood pressure rise. The one goal the study did not achieve was better blood-sugar control.\n\n\u201cThere is some benefit, but it wasn\u2019t the full benefit we hoped for,\u201d said Helen Nickerson, senior scientific program manager at JDRF, formerly known as the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, which partly funded the study. Even so, she said, she is hearing from doctors that growing numbers of them are prescribing metformin along with insulin to patients with Type 1 diabetes.\n\nNo one would suggest that a person with Type 1 diabetes stop taking their insulin. Doing so would be life-threatening. For those with Type 1, metformin is being tested only as an add-on to insulin.\n\nJDRF, meanwhile, is funding a clinical trial to see if metformin will reduce the risk of heart disease in people with Type 1, and it is funding a trial in Britain to see if the drug will prevent children from developing Type 1 in the first place.\n\nTerry Wilkin, a professor of endocrinology and metabolism at the University of Exeter, is leading the prevention trial. He theorizes that the risk of developing Type 1 rises when excess demand for insulin is placed on the pancreas in children who are even slightly overweight. His study will give low daily doses of metformin to children who are at high risk of developing Type 1.\n\n\u201cIf we can even slightly lower their average blood sugar with metformin,\u201d Wilkin said, \u201cI believe we can have a big benefit on their risk of developing Type 1.\u201d\n\nDespite all these potential benefits of metformin \u2014 and despite a recommendation from the American Diabetes Association that it be tried before any other drug for newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetics \u2014 a recent study found that only about half of all such people get metformin as their first prescribed medication. The study does not explain why that might be. Among the possibilities, experts say, are that newer drugs are being pushed heavily in direct-to-patient advertising and that some patients are turned off by the common though mild side effect of metformin \u2014 stomach upset and diarrhea \u2014 which can usually be avoided by starting on a low dose.\n\nThe author of the study, Niteesh Choudhry, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, also found that newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetics who start on metformin are the least likely to need an additional diabetes drug later.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that physicians and patients are not always choosing to start on metformin,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are legitimate reasons to put patients on one drug rather than another. But the guidelines do recommend metformin first.\u201d\n\nFor patients with Type 2 whose doctor started them on a drug other than metformin, he said, \u201cI certainly would encourage people to talk with their doctor. That\u2019s always a good thing.\u201d\n\nHurley is a New Jersey-based science journalist who writes frequently on diabetes and health.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The implication of this story is that metformin may help others besides those with type 2 diabetes.

One expert, Dr. Dale Bredesen, a professor at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and a professor at the Easton Laboratories for Neurodegenerative Disease Research at UCLA, thinks he might have found a way to reverse memory loss, a hallmark of the disease.\n\nIn a study published in the journal Aging, Bredesen and colleagues showed how 10 patients who were experiencing age-related memory decline showed brain scan improvements after following an approach called metabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration (MEND), a 36-point individualized regimen of diet, exercise, brain stimulation, sleep improvements, medication and vitamins and other specific protocols for five to 24 months.\n\nFor example, an MRI of one patient showed hippocampal volume at the 17th percentile for his age range prior to MEND. (The hippocampus is a brain area critical for learning and memory that shrinks in Alzheimer's patients.) After 10 months of following the prescribed protocol, his hippocampal volume increased to the 75th percentile.\n\nThe study noted that some of the patients who had to quit working as a result of their memory decline, were able to return to work after adopting MEND and participants who were struggling at their jobs reported an improvement in job performance.\n\n\"Lives have been dramatically impacted,\" Bredesen told CBS News. \"I'm enthusiastic about that and continue to evolve the protocol.\"\n\nJames E. Galvin, M.D., M.P.H., a professor of clinical biomedical science at FAU's Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine and a professor in the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing, who was not involved in the study, agreed that personalized approaches such as the MEND protocol are the types of approaches needed for this disease going forward. \"It's important to be excited about this approach,\" he told CBS News. However, Galvin cautioned, \"I'm not sure about the method.\"\n\nThe MEND protocol, outlined in a 2014 study in the journal Aging, calls for interventions to treat conditions that could be associated with Alzheimer's such as inflammation, stress and diabetes. However, MEND also requires the use of supplements which are not well studied and do not require FDA approval.\n\n\"Not all things from the approach have a lot of scientific support behind them,\" Galvin told CBS News.\n\nBut Bredesen believes that the only way to treat Alzheimer's is to treat all of the underlying problems, which may require intervention with supplements. \"Nutrition, exercise, sleep, stress reduction -- these are all critical pieces of this,\" he told CBS News. \"It's about optimizing biochemistry for your genetics, whatever it takes.\"\n\nBut even if MEND is effective, the program is complex and difficult to follow. A Buck Institute press release on the study stated: \"None of the patients were able to stick to the entire protocol. The significant diet and lifestyle changes, and multiple pills required each day, were the two most common complaints.\"\n\nBredesen said that to simplify the program, they are connecting patients with health coaches. \"We're trying to make it simpler, but we don't want to lose the efficacy,\" he said.\n\nBredesen noted, too, that the MEND protocol was suitable for patients in the early stages of Alzheimer's. One participant from the 2014 study, who had been diagnosed with late-stage Alzheimer's, did not show improvements with the protocol.\n\n\"If you told me that your mother is 86 and living in a home, I would say that I'd want to treat you,\" he said. \"It's about prevention.\"\n\nBredesen said that his team has a couple of larger trials planned to confirm or refute the results in the current study and to address key questions about how long results can be maintained and how late in the course of cognitive decline reversal is possible.\n\nGalvin agrees that more research is necessary before any conclusive results can be reported. \"This is moving in the right direction,\" he told CBS News. \"These anecdotal case reports provide a nice point to start a discussion.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not mention any potential risks of any aspect of the protocol.

A new study identifies patterns of communication that can help couples affected by Alzheimer\u2019s maintain a sense of connection, which could improve quality of life for both partners.\n\nPrevious research on communication in couples affected by Alzheimer\u2019s has tended to focus on deficits, said study author Christine Williams, professor and director of the PhD in Nursing program at Florida Atlantic University\u2019s Christine E.

Identifying patterns that help couples maintain their bond could make it easier for caregiving spouses to find meaning and improve satisfaction with their marriage.\n\n\u201cNo one is looking at it from the perspective of what these couples are doing right, what is helping,\u201d said Williams, whose findings were published in the International Journal for Human Caring. \u201cSome past research has involved a caregiver giving directions and seeing if his or her spouse [with Alzheimer\u2019s] can follow. A relationship is obviously so much more than that.\u201d\n\nMembers of Williams\u2019s research team visited 15 couples in their home once a week for 10 weeks. The couples, who were recruited from a day program for people with memory disorders and their spouses, were receiving coaching in communication, with caregivers learning to listen, to avoid arguing, to not treat their spouse like a child. Twice during the 10 weeks, the couples were asked to discuss a topic of their choosing while the researcher left the room. A total of thirty 10-minute conversations were recorded.\n\nIn analyzing the recordings, Williams identified 10 communication patterns that caregiving spouses used to connect with their partners and show affection. These patterns showed the caregivers applying what they\u2019d learned through coaching in creative ways, she said. They included sharing news about friends or relatives or plans for the day as a way to involve their spouse in day-to-day events; waiting patiently and keeping eye contact while spouses searched for words; and finding alternate ways to communicate \u2014 for example, singing songs together when attempts to engage the spouse in certain topics failed.\n\nThe caregiving spouses seemed to value their partners\u2019 efforts to communicate as much as or more than the actual content of their conversations. They were willing to listen to stories they had heard before, and resisted correcting their partners\u2019 versions of past events. This showed that they \u201cvalue the relationship more than being right,\u201d Williams said.\n\nSome of the caregivers did voice frustration or tried to teach their partners information they had forgotten. Future research might focus on interventions that could help diffuse these frustrations, the paper noted. Yet Williams hopes that the more supportive and positive communication patterns that many of the caregivers showed will help nurses coach spouses and family members affected by Alzheimer\u2019s. Previous research has found that communication decline among people with dementia is a significant source of stress to caregivers, and most say they need education about communication.\n\n\u201cThe reality is, a person with dementia isn\u2019t going to have a dramatic breakthrough and remember things forgotten,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAt the same time, people with Alzheimer\u2019s do have moments of clarity or show affection when it\u2019s unexpected.

But there are currently no curative treatments available for vascular dementia or Alzheimer's disease, the most common causes of dementia. Also, the cells lining the brain's blood vessels are tightly packed, forming a blood-brain barrier that prevents large molecules from crossing into the brain tissue. This limits the types of drugs and cell therapies that could be made available to treat dementia.\n\nShimokawa and his team had conducted previous studies showing that LIPUS improved blood vessel formation in pigs with myocardial ischemia, a condition where there is reduced blood flow to the heart. Other studies have reported that LIPUS increases the production of proteins involved in nerve cell survival and growth, in addition to a role in promoting nerve regeneration. Focusing LIPUS treatment on a region in the brain called the hippocampus, which is involved in memory, has also been found to improve dementia in mice, but the details of how it does this need to be more fully investigated.\n\nThe Tohoku University team wanted to find out if whole-brain rather than focused LIPUS is effective in treating mouse models of dementia, and if it was, what was happening at the molecular levels to achieve this.\n\nThey found that cognitive impairment markedly improved in mice with conditions similar to vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease when LIPUS was applied to the whole brain three times a day for 20 minutes each time.

After a recovery period of approximately two months \u2014 during which the woman\u2019s chest skin heals, blood supply replenishes, and the expanders are gradually inflated to stretch the skin \u2014 the patient returns for an outpatient surgical procedure to replace the tissue expanders with permanent breast implants. In addition to exceptional cosmetic results, the technique is likely to improve clinical outcomes as evidenced by ongoing research that shows women who undergo this procedure experience less pain and a shorter recovery period.\n\n\u201cOver the past decade there have been dramatic improvements in breast reconstruction that utilize various types of surgical innovations, implants, and biologic tissue,\u201d notes Dr. Small. \u201cIt is very rewarding as a reconstructive surgeon to continuously refine these procedures for our patients.\u201d\n\nMs. Burt chose the Valley breast surgery team after carefully researching her treatment options for DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ), a diagnosis that is often debated among clinicians as to whether it should be classified as breast cancer at all.

Bochner teamed up with Northwestern oncologist Dr. Leo Gordon and colleagues to test if this BTK inhibitor could shut down an enzyme inside cells that is involved when you have an allergic reaction.\n\n\"Ibrutinib is considered a game changer in these two types of cancers,\" said Gordon, the Abby and John Friend Professor of Cancer Research at Feinberg. \"We understood that it might have some biologic effects in what Bruce is interested in, so we were happy to participate in his study. It's an interesting repurposing of that drug.\"\n\nWhile the study was small - only two patients qualified out of about 35 that were screened for allergies - the implications are much larger for later phases of this study. Bochner and his colleagues Drs. Anne Marie Singh and Melanie Dispenza are now testing how successful the drug is at targeting allergies to food, such as tree nuts and peanuts.\n\n\"Preventing or lessening the severity of an allergic reaction to a food you've ingested that you're allergic to is kind of the holy grail of food allergy treatment,\" Bochner said. \"I don't know if this or similar drugs will ever make it possible for a peanut-allergic person to eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but we're excited to use this approach to teach us how to lessen the risks of food allergy reactions.\"\n\nCurrently, the study is being expanded to adults with food allergy to see if their skin test and basophil activation test responses show a similar reduction with just a few doses of ibrutinib and how long such benefits might last. If the results are favorable, the next step would be to get funding to actually test whether taking a BTK inhibitor will improve the ability of food-allergic adults to eat foods they're allergic to.\n\n\"The hope is that drugs like BTK inhibitors will protect people with food allergies from having anaphylaxis, or at least increase how much of that food they can eat without reacting,\" Bochner said. \"Maybe they'll increase from being able to eat just one peanut to 10 before they react. Or maybe they'll be able to eat a full meal's worth of peanuts. We want to know if this would safely change their actual ability to eat foods that they currently need to avoid.\"\n\nThe study was funded by a 2016 Dixon Translational Research Grant.", "question": "Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Readers of this release get no alert that the labeling of ibrutinib warns of potentially life-threatening bleeding, infections, decreased blood cell counts, heart rhythm problems and also that patients commonly suffer diarrhea.

A team from the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology at Oxford University found that a blood test that looks for antibodies that recognize the protein tenascin-C could reliably show those who will contract the condition.\n\nWhen inflammation occurs in the body, some proteins are altered in a process called citrullination. These altered forms can prompt an immune response from the body, which can see it turning antibodies on itself - causing rheumatoid arthritis. For that reason, tests that spot antibodies to citrullinated proteins are already used to diagnose the disease. While tests for individual proteins usually have a relatively low diagnostic sensitivity, a more general test called CCP, that detects synthetic citrullinated peptides, identifies a lot more RA cases.\n\nLead researcher Dr Anja Schwenzer said: 'We knew that tenascin-C is found at high levels in the joints of people with RA. We decided to see if it could be citrullinated and, if so, whether it was a target for the autoantibodies that attack the body in RA. That might also indicate whether it could be used in tests to indicate the disease.\n\n'When we looked at results from more than 2000 patients we found that testing for antibodies that target citrullinated tenascin-C (cTNC) could diagnose RA in around 50% of cases, including some cases not identified by CCP. It also has a very low rate of false positives - it is 98% accurate at ruling out RA.'\n\nThe Kennedy Institute's Professor Kim Midwood said: 'What is particularly exciting is that when we looked at samples taken from people before their arthritis began, we could see these antibodies to cTNC up to 16 years before the disease occurred - on average the antibodies could be found seven years before the disease appeared.\n\n'This discovery therefore gives us an additional test that can be used to increase the accuracy of the CCP assay and that can predict RA, enabling us to monitor people and spot the disease early. This early detection is key because early treatment is more effective.'\n\nStephen Simpson, Research Director, for Arthritis Research UK said: 'When it comes to rheumatoid arthritis, early diagnosis is key with research showing that there is often a narrow 'window of opportunity' following the onset of symptoms for effective diagnosis and control of disease through treatment. Furthermore, current tests for rheumatoid arthritis are limited in their ability to diagnose disease in different patients. This latest research provides the basis of tests that could improve diagnosis and, importantly, detect disease at a very early stage, with the promise even that people at risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis can be followed before the disease begins. This could have great potential to help patients with rheumatoid arthritis get the right treatment early to keep this painful and debilitating condition under control.'", "question": "Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The release briefly notes that the test carries a very low rate of false positives.

According to Professor Andrew Worster, also from McMaster University, \"This lab score may reduce both the number of blood tests and time spent in the emergency department for chest pain patients.\"\n\nPatients with chest pain symptoms require multiple blood tests over several hours before a diagnosis is reached. Previous studies using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin alone to rule out and rule in heart attacks have not consistently demonstrated sufficient safety to use in clinical practice.\n\nIn this international study, researchers from Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Germany combined common laboratory blood tests available at many hospitals around the world to create a single laboratory score, or clinical chemistry score, to diagnose heart attack. These blood tests are part of the World Health Organization's list of essential in vitro diagnostics tests for health care facilities with clinical laboratories.\n\nThe researchers validated the clinical chemistry score as a predictor of heart attack or death within 30 days using data on 4245 patients from emergency department studies in the four countries. Within one month of the emergency department visits, 727 heart attacks or death in patients occurred. A negative (or low-risk) clinical chemistry score at emergency department presentation missed only one of these events compared with up to 25 missed heart attacks/death when using a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin test alone. A positive (or high-risk) clinical chemistry score also identified about 75% of patients at high risk of heart attack or death when positive compared with a low of 40% detected when the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin test alone was positive. The clinical chemistry score worked equally well in men and women.\n\nThe authors suggest the score can be useful for standardizing diagnoses and improving safety.\n\n\"Adoption of the clinical chemistry score algorithm would standardize reporting of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin test results, how the tests are interpreted in the normal range, and represent an option less susceptible to both analytical and preanalytical errors.

The vegetarian diet consisted of vegetables, grains, legumes, fruits and nuts, with animal products limited to a maximum of one portion of low-fat yoghurt per day; the conventional diabetic diet followed the official recommendations of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD). Both diets were restricted by 500 kilocalories per day compared to an isocaloric intake for each individual.\n\nThe vegetarian diet was found to be almost twice as effective in reducing body weight, resulting in an average loss of 6.2kg compared to 3.2kg for the conventional diet.\n\nUsing magnetic resonance imaging, Dr. Kahleov\u00e1 and colleagues then studied adipose (fat-storage) tissue in the subjects' thighs to see how the two different diets had affected subcutaneous, subfascial and intramuscular fat (that is, fat under the skin, on the surface of muscles and inside muscles).\n\nThey found that both diets caused a similar reduction in subcutaneous fat. However, subfascial fat was only reduced in response to the vegetarian diet, and intramuscular fat was more greatly reduced by the vegetarian diet.\n\nThis is important as increased subfascial fat in patients with type 2 diabetes has been associated with insulin resistance, so reducing it could have a beneficial effect on glucose metabolism. In addition, reducing intramuscular fat could help improve muscular strength and mobility, particularly in older people with diabetes.\n\nDr. Kahleov\u00e1 said: \"Vegetarian diets proved to be the most effective diets for weight loss.

EFMT is a cognitive-emotional treatment that is delivered via an app on the Click Neurobehavioral Intervention (CNI) platform , a clinically-validated patient engagement platform developed by Click Therapeutics\u2122.\n\nThis treatment was developed at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai by Brian Iacoviello, PhD, an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry who is Director of Scientific Affairs for Click Therapeutics, and Dennis S. Charney, MD, Anne and Joel Ehrenkranz Dean and Professor of Psychiatry, Neuroscience, and Pharmacological Sciences. The underlying mechanism for MDD that the intervention targets involves an imbalance in the activity of specific brain regions: individuals with MDD show hyperactivity of neural systems involved in emotion processing, such as the amygdala, coupled with decreased activity of systems involved in cognitive control and emotion regulation, such as the prefrontal cortex. The amygdala processes incoming emotionally salient stimuli, whereas the prefrontal cortex, as the executive center of the brain, decides whether the incoming stimuli are noteworthy.\n\nPatients using this therapeutic are asked to identify an emotion displayed in a series of faces, and for each face, they are asked to identify the number of faces earlier in the series in which they encountered the same emotion. This aims to balance brain activity in these regions to work in concert with each other. In the trial, the therapeutic reduced MDD symptoms by 42 percent in the experimental group after six weeks compared to 15.7 percent in the control group, which was given a similar task using simple shapes instead of emotions. \"The aim is to target the thinking abnormality we see in patients with MDD - that of perseverating, ruminating, obsessing, dwelling on the negative - by activating these two nodes (emotion processing and cognitive control) simultaneously. Thus, higher cognitive control regions will stay active even while the brain is processing salient emotional stimuli, giving the individual the capacity to shift their mindfulness and attention so that they are not perseverating,\" said Dr. Iacoviello. The initial results demonstrate that the efficacy of this digital therapeutic is comparable to drug therapy, with a highly favorable safety profile. Dr. Iacoviello added, \"We will be advancing these encouraging results to the next level, by incorporating this therapeutic into a highly engaging mobile platform and launching it through the CNI platform. It's exciting to have the opportunity to test the program within a large health care system such as Mount Sinai.\"\n\nDr. Charney said, \"Mount Sinai embraces creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship.

And, the FDA has already approved it.\n\n\"Our data suggests that PPF, working in combination with TMZ and radiation, could limit glioblastoma invasion and improve the clinical outcome for brain tumor patients,\" said Dr. Tran, the study's senior author.\n\nThis study was funded, in part, by The Ben & Catherine Ivy Foundation.\n\n\"GBM is one of the most aggressive of all cancers and it affects people of all ages,\" said Catherine (Bracken) Ivy, founder and president of The Ben & Catherine Ivy Foundation. \"Funding research focused on helping patients survive longer is critical, and studies such as this advance our goal of not only improving treatments for brain cancer, but eventually finding a cure.\"\n\nOne of the primary treatments for glioblastoma is surgical removal of the tumor. However, because of the aggressive way glioblastomas invade surrounding brain tissue, it is impossible to remove all parts of the tumors, and the cancer eventually returns and spreads. This insidious cancer invasion also limits the effectiveness of chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy.\n\nTGen found that PPF works to limit the spread of glioblastomas by targeting and knocking down the expression of the TROY protein. TGen researchers have linked TROY to the cellular mechanisms that enable glioblastomas to invade normal brain cells, and resist anti-cancer drugs.\n\n\"New therapeutic strategies that target the molecular drivers of invasion are required for improved clinical outcome,\" said Dr. Harshil Dhruv, a TGen Research Assistant Professor and lead author of the study. \"Propentofylline may provide a pharmacologic approach to targeting TROY, inhibiting cell invasion and reducing therapeutic resistance in glioblastomas.\"\n\nOne of the fundamental challenges in treating brain cancer with drugs is what is known as the blood-brain barrier that separates circulating blood from the brain extracellular fluid in the central nervous system. This barrier works to protect the brain from toxins. However, this security system is so effective at protecting the brain that it prevents many life-saving drugs -- all but some small molecules -- from being able to treat cancer and other diseases of the brain.\n\nAs a result, there has been little progress in recent decades in finding new effective treatments for GBM. Median survival for newly diagnosed GBM patients is only 14.6 months. Only 5 percent of patients survive more than 5 years.\n\n\"Clinical trials revealed that PPF can cross the blood-brain barrier, and has minimal side effects,\" Dr. Tran said. \"PPF could be easily translated to the clinic as an adjuvant therapy in combination with standard of care treatment for GBM patients.\"\n\nThis study -- Propentofylline inhibits glioblastoma cell invasion and survival by targeting the TROY signaling pathway -- also was funded by the National Institutes of Health under grants NS86853 and P50 CA108961.

In fact, the physician has wagered a few good bottles of champagne that none of three large randomized trials now underway will find proof of positive effects.\n\nTo Autier, a researcher at the Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences in Glasgow, Scotland, the widespread faith in vitamin D\u2019s benefits is like a religion. \u201cPeople want to have a simple story they can believe in,\u201d he says.\n\nCedric Garland, meanwhile, hews just as strongly to the opposite view \u2014 that vitamin D supplements confer a slew of benefits, including warding off colon cancer, breast cancer, even Type 1 diabetes.\n\n\u201cThe science is, in my opinion, unassailable,\u201d says Garland, an adjunct professor of epidemiology at the University of California at San Diego. \u201cIt\u2019s just preposterous to say it\u2019s not proven.\u201d\n\nIn January 2014, Autier published a statistical analysis of results from hundreds of studies of vitamin D. He concluded: \u201cUnfortunately, there is probably no benefit to expect from vitamin D supplementation in normally healthy people.\u201d\n\nGarland, on the other hand, is the co-author of dozens of studies showing a strong, inverse association between vitamin D levels and seemingly every disease under the sun. Indeed, sun exposure is Garland\u2019s explanation for why rates of cancer, Type 1 diabetes and other diseases tend to be higher the farther people live from the equator. Vitamin D, after all, is the \u201csunshine vitamin,\u201d synthesized from cholesterol in the skin in response to sunlight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mathematical relationship,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe higher your latitude and the greater your area\u2019s average cloud cover, the higher your rates of cancer.\u201d Since he and his late brother, Frank Garland, published the first study, in 1980, revealing that relationship, hundreds of other studies have explored the link between vitamin D, including supplements, and health \u2014 but none were large enough, long enough or designed well enough to convince the skeptics.\n\nNow three nationally recognized researchers are leading landmark studies designed to settle at least some of the questions about vitamin D once and for all. The one thing the research leaders are certain of is that the public\u2019s faith in vitamin D as a modern panacea has far outpaced what the scientific evidence proves.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a rush to judgment on vitamin D,\u201d says JoAnn E. Manson, chief of the division of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. \u201cEveryone has gotten on the bandwagon. Unfortunately, the lessons of history have shown repeatedly that many of these supplements that appeared to be very promising did not pan out in more rigorous testing.\u201d\n\nManson should know. She has led or collaborated on more than a dozen large, randomized, placebo-controlled studies, dating back more than two decades, which found none of the expected protection against cancer, heart disease, dementia or other diseases that scientists once attributed to beta carotene, vitamin E or vitamin C supplements. (She did find, however, that supplementation with folic acid, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 offered modest protection against age-related macular degeneration and, for those with a diet low in B vitamins to begin with, a hint of protection against the loss of cognitive abilities.)\n\nNow Manson is co-directing the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL), testing whether, compared with placebo, a daily supplement of either 2,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D or one gram of fish oil (another widely touted substance) reduces the risk of stroke, cancer, heart disease and other health problems. The five-year study, involving 25,874 men and women, is scheduled to end in October 2017.\n\nAnother trial is testing whether a daily supplement of 4,000 IU of vitamin D will prevent Type 2 diabetes. The so-called D2d study, which will run for four years, is seeking to enroll 2,382 people older than 30 who are at high risk of developing diabetes due to weight or blood-sugar levels but who have not yet been diagnosed with the disease.\n\n\u201cI would call myself an optimistic skeptic,\u201d says Anastasios Pittas, principal investigator of the D2d study and a professor of medicine at Tufts School of Medicine in Boston. \u201cThe indirect evidence is very strong. People with higher levels of vitamin D in their blood have been shown again and again to have a lower risk of developing diabetes in the future. These studies are as consistent as we have ever seen with any nutrient.\u201d\n\nBut, he adds, \u201cthose studies do not prove cause and effect. Before we make a blanket recommendation for the 86 million people in the United States who are at risk for Type 2 diabetes to go out and buy vitamin D supplements, we need to know for sure if they help.\u201d\n\nA third trial, designed to test whether 5,000 IU of vitamin D per day will slow the progression of multiple sclerosis in 172 patients, is being led by Ellen Mowry, an associate professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cI do discuss vitamin D with my patients,\u201d Mowry says. \u201cBut I point out that we don\u2019t yet have randomized, controlled-trials data to back it up. That\u2019s why there are no official recommendations yet from any medical organizations. We have to be sure.\u201d\n\nSo what are people to do in the meantime? Four years ago, Manson sat on a committee established by the Institute of Medicine to review how much vitamin D and calcium Americans need each day to maintain health and prevent disease. The report concluded that both are necessary for bone health but that as for preventing cancer, heart disease, diabetes and autoiummune disorders, the evidence was \u201cinconsistent, inconclusive as to causality, and insufficient to inform nutritional requirements.\u201d Even so, the committee recommended that children and adults up to age 70 get 600 IU of vitamin D daily \u2014 from food and, if necessary, supplements \u2014 and that adults age 71 and older get 800 IU.\n\nSome studies have found no ill effects from taking far higher amounts, and many of the prospective but not proven benefits against cancer and other diseases are believed to require doses ranging from 2,000 to 5,000 IU. Manson urges people to rely on the Institute of Medicine report, which set a safe upper limit of 4,000 IU of vitamin D per day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine to take that amount,\u201d Manson said. \u201cBut keep in mind, there isn\u2019t yet evidence that taking those higher amounts will confer any benefits beyond the recommended daily allotment of 600 to 800 IU.\u201d\n\nSome studies, she noted, have even found evidence that very high levels of vitamin D circulating in the blood might be just as unhealthful as very low levels. A 2014 study, for instance, found that people with the highest levels of vitamin D in their blood (more than 60 nanograms per milliliter) were significantly more likely to die in the three months following a hospitalization as were people whose levels were between 30 and 49.9 ng/mL. Such findings are why she, Mowry and Pittas strongly advise people against taking more than the currently recommended upper daily limit of 4,000 IU, even though doses as high as 10,000 IU are available online and at many stores.\n\nFrustrated by the uncertainty? Pittas takes it in stride.\n\n\u201cThis is the beauty of medical research,\u201d he says, \u201cwhere you have some people convinced that vitamin D does nothing and others who believe it\u2019s already proved to work. There is such controversy now that the only way to convince people who sit on those sides of the equation is to complete rigorous, randomized trials. We\u2019ll see what happens. I have a hypothesis that vitamin D will work, but we have to test it. At the end of the studies, one of us will be right. I just don\u2019t know which one.\u201d\n\nHurley is a science journalist and author of \u201cNatural Causes: Death, Lies and Politics in America\u2019s Vitamin and Herbal Supplement Industry\u201d (Broadway Books, 2007).", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Research has shown risks from high levels of vitamin D.

The test also has potential for early diagnosis of other degenerative neurological conditions, including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and multiple sclerosis.\n\nResults of first clinical trials with glaucoma patients are published today (28/04/17) in the journal BRAIN.\n\nProfessor Francesca Cordeiro at UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, who led the research, said: \"Detecting glaucoma early is vital as symptoms are not always obvious. Although detection has been improving, most patients have lost a third of vision by the time they are diagnosed. Now, for the first time, we have been able to show individual cell death and detect the earliest signs of glaucoma. While we cannot cure the disease, our test means treatment can start before symptoms begin. In the future, the test could also be used to diagnose other neurodegenerative diseases.\"\n\nLoss of sight in patients with glaucoma is caused by the death of cells in the retina at the back of the eye. This cell death is called apoptosis.\n\nAs with other neurodegenerative conditions, more and more nerve cells are lost as the disease progresses.\n\nProfessor Philip Bloom, Chief Investigator at Western Eye Hospital, part of Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, added: \"Treatment is much more successful when it is begun in early stages of the disease, when sight loss is minimal. Our developments mean we could diagnose patients 10 years earlier than was previously possible.\"\n\nThe technique developed is called DARC, which stands for detection of apoptosing retinal cells. It uses a specially developed fluorescent marker which attaches to cell proteins when injected into patients. Sick cells appear as white fluorescent spots during eye examination. UCL Business, the commercialisation company of UCL, holds the patents for the technology.\n\nThe examination uses equipment used during routine hospital eye examinations.

Steroids are a standard treatment for pregnant women likely to deliver before 34 weeks because these drugs are known to reduce the chance of complications and death among premature infants. However, because completing the entire course takes at least 48 hours, health care providers may opt not to begin treatment when premature delivery is imminent.\n\nThe new study, supported by NIH\u2019s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), provides strong evidence that even a partial course can have some benefit. Researchers evaluated 6,121 extremely premature infants who had been born between 22 and 27 weeks of pregnancy at sites in NICHD\u2019s Neonatal Research Network. The study followed the infants from birth to 18 to 22 months of age and measured survival and brain and nervous system outcomes.

Infants in the complete treatment group fared best. Infants in the partial treatment group fared better than untreated infants. The study team also found evidence that the better outcomes likely were due to lower rates of bleeding in the brain and of a brain injury called cystic periventricular leukomalacia.

Such fasting already shows benefits after only six weeks. This is according to a study by Kyoung-Han Kim and Yun Hye Kim in the journal Cell Research which is published by Springer Nature. Intermittent fasting in mice helped to kick-start the animals' metabolism and to burn fat by generating body heat. The research team was led by Hoon-Ki Sung of The Hospital for Sick Children in Ontario, Canada.\n\nResearch has shown that our unhealthy eating habits and sedentary lifestyles are playing a major role in the development of lifestyle-related metabolic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and obesity. For this reason, dietary interventions like intermittent fasting are gaining popularity to treat conditions such as obesity.\n\nThe research team in this study wanted to better understand the reactions that interventions such as fasting trigger on a molecular level in the body. They exposed groups of mice to sixteen weeks of intermittent fasting. The recurring regimen saw the animals being fed for two days, followed by one day without anything to eat. Their calorie intake was not adjusted otherwise. Four months later the mice in the fasting group weighed less than those in the control group who continued to eat the same volume of food. The lower body weight of the mice in the fasting group was not the only effect. The fasting regime helped lower fat build-up in the white fat by increasing the brown-like fat (involved in burning energy and producing body heat) of mice on the high fat diet. Their glucose and insulin systems also remained more stable. In a further experiment, similar benefits were already seen after only six weeks of intermittent fasting.\n\nThrough an analysis into the underlying biology involved, the researchers found that such intermittent fasting tempers an immune reaction in fat cells. There are changes in certain gene pathways involved in the immune system and the body's reaction to inflammation. A type of white blood cell known to play a role in fighting inflammation is triggered. Known as anti-inflammatory macrophages, these cells stimulate the fat cells to burn stored fats or lipids by generating heat. This happens during periods of intermittent fasting because there is an increase in vascular growth factor (VEGF) that help form blood vessels and activate anti-inflammatory macrophage.\n\n\"Intermittent fasting without a reduction in calorie intake can be a preventative and therapeutic approach against obesity and metabolic disorders,\" says Kyoung-Han Kim.\n\n\"Strikingly, these fasting-stimulated changes in the growth of vascular cells and subsequent immune alterations occur even after a single cycle of 24-hour fasting, and are completely reversed when mice start eating again,\" adds Yun Hye Kim.\n\nReference: Kim, K-H. et al (2017).

It is believed that success rates could be hindered as a result of treating all prostate cancers in the same way.\n\nA team at the University of York and the University of British Columbia, Canada, however, have designed a test that can pick out life-threatening prostate cancers, with up to 92% accuracy.\n\nProfessor Norman Maitland, from the University of York's Department of Biology, said: \"Unnecessary prostate treatment has both physical consequences for patients and their families, but is also a substantial financial burden on the NHS, where each operation will cost around \u00a310,000.\n\n\"Cancers that are contained in the prostate, however, have the potential to be 'actively monitored' which is not only cheaper, but has far fewer negative side-effects in patients with non-life threatening cancer.\"\n\nIt is now understood that to find the different levels of cancer, scientists have to identify genes that have been altered in different cancer types. The team analysed more than 500 cancer tissue samples and compared them with non-cancer tissue to search for patterns of a chemical group that is added to part of the DNA molecule, altering gene expression.\n\nA person's age, what they eat and how they sleep, for example, impacts on chemical alterations to genes and which ones are turned on and off. This is part of the normal functioning of the human body and can tell individuals apart, but the process can sometimes go wrong, resulting in various diseases.\n\nProfessor Maitland said: \"In some diseases, such as cancer, genes can be switched to an opposite state, causing major health issues and threat to life.\n\n\"The challenge in prostate cancer is how to look at all of these patterns within a cell, but hone in on the gene activity that suggests cancer, and not only this, what type of cancer - dangerous or manageable?\n\n\"To put it another way: how to do we distinguish the tiger cancer cells from the pussycat cancer cells, when there are millions of patterns of chemical alterations going on, many of which will be perfectly healthy?\"\n\nThe team needed to eliminate the 'noise' of the genetic patterns that make individuals unique, to leave them with the patterns that indicate cancer. They were able to do this using a computer algorithm, which left the team with 17 possible genetic markers for prostate cancer.\n\nDr Davide Pellacani, who began these studies in York, before moving to the University of British Columbia, said: \"Using this computer analysis, not only could we see which tissue samples had cancer and which didn't, but also which cancers were dangerous and which ones less so.\n\n\"Out of almost a million markers studied, we were able to use our new tools to single out differences in cancer potency.\"\n\nTo take this method out of the laboratory, the team are now investigating a further trial with new cancer samples, and hope to involve a commercial partner to allow this to be used for patients being treated in the NHS.\n\nThe research, published in the British Journal of Cancer, was funded by The Freemasons of the Province of Yorkshire (North and East Ridings) and The Masonic Samaritan Fund.

In both test groups, only about 3 percent of the people had heart attacks, suffered \"major\" complications, needed hospitalization for chest pain or died during two years of tracking, researchers found.\n\nWhich prompts a big question: Could the use of stress tests or expensive scans become less frequent for heart patients, replaced by more watchful waiting?\n\n\"We were very pleasantly surprised,\" said Dr. Pamela Douglas, Ursula Geller professor of research in cardiovascular diseases at Duke University, and the study\u2019s lead author.\n\nResults of the federally funded trial \u2014 Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain (PROMISE) \u2014 were presented at the American College of Cardiology\u2019s 64th Annual Scientific Session in San Diego.

We didn\u2019t before.\"\n\nThe 10,000-plus patients, who visited 193 health centers in the U.S. and Canada, had no prior diagnosis of coronary artery disease. But they had new symptoms that caused physicians to suspect heart disease \u2014 and nearly all had at least one risk factor like high blood pressure, diabetes or a history of smoking.\n\nHalf were randomly selected to get a computed tomographic angiography (CTA), which creates a 3-D image of the heart's arteries, allowing physicians to spot narrowing. The rest took stress tests \u2014 either an exercise electrocardiogram, a stress echocardiography or a nuclear stress test, which uses radioactive dye. Stress tests measure the heart's response to exertion, letting doctors see or hear any disease.\n\n\"The remarkable thing about the study is ... these were quite high-risk patients, but the actual [bad] event rate was very low ...

Cowen & Co estimates that use of DNA blood tests for cancer screening will exceed $10 billion a year by the end of the decade.\n\nBut the move by Pathway, a privately owned maker of genetic tests ranging from cancer risk and heart health to drug response, underscores a growing debate over how much genetic information should be made available to healthy people if it is not yet clear how it can improve their health.\n\nThe company has already run into trouble on a similar issue. In 2010, Walgreens pulled Pathway\u2019s genetic testing kits from its pharmacies after U.S. health regulators warned patients might take action without understanding the results.\n\nSeveral oncology experts said liquid biopsy tests like Pathway\u2019s, while exciting, still require large clinical studies proving they help people beat cancer through early detection. Doctors will also need a clear assessment of their accuracy.\n\n\u201cFor any given test, the rate of false positives causing unnecessary alarm and false negatives that provide false security should be known,\u201d said Dr. Keith Stewart, an oncologist who heads Mayo Clinic\u2019s Center for Individualized Medicine.\n\nPathway\u2019s screening test looks at 96 genetic markers associated with major cancer types such as breast, ovarian, lung, colon and melanoma. The company is focusing on mutations that are relatively well-understood, and for which there are specific treatments, said Chief Executive Jim Plante.\n\nThe cost to consumers begins at $299 to periodically check for DNA in their blood that could act as an early warning sign of cancer. The tests must be ordered by a doctor, based on a patient\u2019s risk profile. A positive test will require additional checks to find where the cancer is growing.\n\nPathway also launched a blood test for patients already diagnosed with cancer to help determine whether a treatment is working, or whether the disease is likely to return.\n\nScientists have long known that cancers shed bits of genetic material into the blood. Privately held Guardant Health and Personal Genome Diagnostics Inc already offer blood tests for cancer patients. Roche-backed Foundation Medicine Inc, Genomic Health Inc, Illumina Inc and Sequenom Inc say they have similar tests in the works.\n\nBut cancer experts say there are major differences between using such tests to screen for cancer and monitoring patients who are already known to have it.\n\nFor example, some early cancers may not secrete DNA fragments into the bloodstream and require other types of detection.

It had already spread to her lungs, and the prognosis was grim. She had about a 50-50 chance of surviving the next six months.\n\n\"Yeah, that was the turning point of life, right there,\" she says.\n\nWhat Belvin didn't know at the time was that a revolutionary treatment for melanoma had begun testing in clinical trials. An immunologist named Jim Allison, now at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, had figured out that if the immune system was tweaked just right, it could do a better job of killing the cancer than the usual treatments. (Joe Palca worked for Allison early in both men's careers.)\n\nAllison's treatment was still experimental, but if it worked, it had the potential to save Belvin's life.\n\n\"It's a new modality for treating cancer,\" Dr. Samuel Broder, a former director of the National Cancer Institute, says now of Allison's pioneering research. \"It used to be there were three basic treatment options for cancer \u2014 surgery, radiation and chemotherapy \u2014 or some combination of those three. It's fair to say there's now a fourth option.\"\n\nAllison's long search for this new kind of treatment \u2014 one that has since become a lifesaver for some cancer patients \u2014 began around a decade before Belvin got sick, when Allison was running a lab at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nAt the time, he was what you could call a research scientist's research scientist. He was fascinated by certain powerful cells of the immune system \u2014 T cells. A subset of white blood cells, T cells travel around the body and can \"protect us against just about anything,\" Allison says.\n\nT cells do recognize cancer cells, but not in a way that can eliminate the disease. Allison had been studying T cells for years, and thought that by tinkering with one key molecule on the outside of these cells, he could enhance their response to cancer, enough to eradicate the illness.\n\nHe and one of his grad students ran an experiment to test the tweaked T cells on cancerous tumors in mice, and the initial results astounded them. The T cells seemed to be doing just what Allison had hoped they would do \u2014 shrink the tumors and kill the cancer.\n\nAllison repeated the experiment with more mice over his winter break. After a few tense days, the tumors again disappeared.\n\n\"These mice were cured,\" Allison says.\n\n\"I've been doing this sort of stuff for years, and I'd never seen anything like that,\" Allison says. \"And I thought, 'If we could do that in people, this is going to be amazing.' \"\n\nAllison tried to persuade drugmakers to create a human version of the treatment that had worked in mice. He thought they would jump at the chance to try a new approach.\n\nBut the biotech companies he met with didn't bite. In those days, most firms were focused on drugs that would target tumors directly, and Allison was asking them to try something very different.\n\n\"This was targeting the immune system, not the cancer,\" he says. \"We weren't trying to kill the cancer cells. We were letting the T cells kill the cancer cells.\"\n\nThanks, but no thanks, the companies told him.\n\n\"I got very depressed,\" Allison says. He was sure this was the most important work of his career, but he had to get others on board.\n\nEventually, a scientist attending one of Allison's research talks was intrigued enough to contact a pal at the biotech firm Medarex. The company had recently developed technology that could make a human version of Allison's therapy, and was willing to give it a try.\n\nIt took a decade, but eventually Allison's big idea was ready for testing in people. A clinical trial to study the drug \u2014 now called ipilimumab, or Ippy for short \u2014 was set up at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.\n\nAllison decided he wanted to be part of this next chapter in the testing of immunotherapy, so he packed up his California lab and moved it to Sloan Kettering.\n\nAs it happens, Belvin was also in New York \u2014 a patient of Dr. Jedd Wolchok at Sloan Kettering. By the fall of 2004, Belvin had run through all the treatment options available to her. Nothing had worked to control the melanoma; it continued to spread dangerously throughout her body.\n\nBelvin remembers feeling sick and depressed, and says she wasn't even paying much attention when Wolchok walked into the exam room and suggested one last treatment.\n\n\"Sharon, we have an opportunity to participate in a clinical trial here. It's something you should consider,\" Wolchok told her.\n\nBelvin says she signed up without hesitation. After just four injections of Ippy across three months, her cancer was nearly gone. And at Belvin's follow-up appointment a year later, Wolchok delivered news that was hard for her to take in: \"Sharon, you no longer have cancer.\"\n\nAnd in the next breath, Belvin recalls, \"he goes, 'Oh, the guy who invented this is upstairs. Do you want to meet him?' \"\n\n\"Yes, of course I want to meet him!\" she told her doctor.\n\nWolchok called Allison, who was working nearby, and told him to drop everything and come to the clinic \u2014 a part of the hospital Allison had rarely seen. Though the research scientist couldn't imagine why Wolchok was in such a rush, he quickly figured it out as he opened the door and was greeted by Belvin with a huge hug.\n\nBelvin says she tried not to tackle him. \"It was hard to control myself,\" she says. \"I owe this man my life.\"\n\nBelvin was the first recipient of the immunotherapy that Allison had ever met. \"It really meant a lot,\" he says. \"It reminded me what it's all about at the end of the day.\"\n\nThat was in 2005; today, Sharon Belvin is still cancer-free.\n\nIppy is now sold under the brand name Yervoy by Bristol-Myers Squibb, which bought Medarex in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, Jim Allison has become a bit of a celebrity in the cancer research world. Among other honors, he was a 2015 recipient of the prestigious Lasker Award for his achievements in medical science.\n\nHe's become well-known among patients, too. Now and again, Allison fields calls from patients yearning to learn from the master himself what it will take to cure their disease.\n\nAllison can't really answer them. Each case is different, and using a patient's own cells to destroy tumors won't work in every patient or in every type of cancer. Still, the approach offers promise to some people that other therapies can't, and has transformed the way doctors think about cancer treatment.\n\nIt might be too early to say we're going to cure cancer, Allison says, \"but we're going to cure certain types of cancers.

Treatment of unstable fractures is either surgical or nonsurgical (using externally applied casts). Neither method yields an entirely satisfactory outcome in older adults. Traditional casting techniques are associated with poor fracture alignment and healing, as well as plaster-related sores. Surgery is often complicated by poor implant fixation (bone healing), wound problems, and infection. A modified casting technique has been developed, close contact casting, which uses minimal padding compared with traditional casting and achieves fracture reduction by distributing contact pressure by close anatomic fit.\n\nKeith Willett, M.B.B.S., F.R.C.S., of the University of Oxford, United Kingdom, and colleagues randomly assigned 620 adults older than 60 years with acute, unstable ankle fracture to surgery (n = 309) or casting (n = 311). Casts were applied in the operating room under general or spinal anesthesia by a trained surgeon.\n\nAmong the 620 adults (average age, 71 years; 74 percent women) who were randomized, 96 percent completed the study. Nearly all participants (93 percent) received assigned treatment; 52 of 275 (19 percent) who initially received casting later converted to surgery. At 6 months, casting resulted in measures of ankle function equivalent to that with surgery. Infection and wound breakdown were more common with surgery (10 percent vs 1 percent), as were additional operating room procedures (6 percent vs 1 percent).\n\nRadiologic malunion (abnormal healing of a fracture) was more common in the casting group (15 percent vs 3 percent for surgery). Casting required less operating room time compared with surgery. There were no significant differences in other secondary outcomes: quality of life, pain, ankle motion, mobility, and patient satisfaction.\n\n\"Close contact casting was delivered successfully for most participants, substantially reducing the number of patients requiring invasive surgical procedures at the outset and additional operations during a 6-month period,\" the authors write.\n\nThe researchers add that close contact casting may be an appropriate treatment for older adults with unstable ankle fracture.\n\nEditor's Note: Please see the article for additional information, including other authors, author contributions and affiliations, financial disclosures, funding and support, etc.\n\n\"The results reported by Willett et al demonstrate that most unstable ankle fractures in older patients can be treated with a cast without the need for surgery,\" writes David W.

It often involves 80-hour weeks and overnight hospital shifts dealing with multiple medical crises.\n\nAn earlier study of 740 interns found that suicidal thoughts increased almost four-fold during the first three months of residency, said Dr. Constance Guille of the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston.

Furthermore, restarting therapy with the new oral anticoagulant dabigatran was associated with a lower risk of recurrent hemorrhage in these cases than the old standby drug warfarin.\n\nPeople take anticoagulants to avoid blood clots when they have a risk for stroke or heart attack, but the downside is that these medications increase a person's risk of severe bleeding--such as in the brain or gut--because the blood isn't clotting as well as it otherwise might.\n\n\"If a patient who is on an anticoagulant to avoid a stroke has a major bleeding event, doctors are faced with a catch-22: Discontinue the anticoagulant to avoid future bleeding, but again place their patient at increased risk of stroke; or resume the anticoagulant to continue avoiding a stroke, but then have to worry about another bleeding event,\" said lead author Inmaculada Hernandez, Pharm.D., Ph.D., an assistant professor in Pitt's School of Pharmacy, who completed this work as a doctoral student at Pitt's Graduate School of Public Health.\n\n\"It causes a lot of uncertainty for physicians, especially because patients at highest risk of recurrent bleeding also are at highest risk of stroke,\" said co-author Yuting Zhang, Ph.D., associate professor of health policy and management at Pitt Public Health, and Hernandez's doctoral dissertation committee chair.\n\nThe Pitt research team obtained data from 2010 to 2012 for a random sample of Medicare beneficiaries. They then followed nearly 90,000 people who had filled prescriptions for the anticoagulants warfarin, which has been used as a medication since 1954, and dabigatran, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2010. More than 1,500 of those people suffered a major bleeding event while using one of the drugs. About half of those people resumed one of the two anticoagulants a few months after the bleeding, while the others did not.\n\nThe risk of dying from any cause or having a stroke was 23 to 34 percent higher in patients who discontinued anticoagulation therapy compared to those who resumed it. People who took dabigatran after their initial bleeding event had nearly half the risk of another major bleeding event within one year compared with those who took warfarin.\n\n\"Our results should encourage clinicians to seriously consider resuming anticoagulation among patients who survived a major bleeding event, particularly if the source of bleeding was identified and addressed,\" said senior author Samir Saba, M.D., associate professor of medicine and associate chief of cardiology at UPMC Heart and Vascular Institute. \"They should also take into account that the benefit-to-risk ratio of post-hemorrhage use of anticoagulation is not the same for all medications.\"\n\nAdditional authors on this research are Maria M.

Using this technology is still seen as a stopgap, however, while a biological solution to diabetes is sought.\n\n\"We have pioneered the development of a closed-loop artificial pancreas because we believe it will significantly impact the lives of individuals with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, by providing exquisite control of blood sugar,\" Dr. Richard A. Insel, executive vice president for research at the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF), said during a noon teleconference Saturday.\n\nA symposium on advances in the technology -- co-sponsored by the American Diabetes Association and the JDRF -- is slated for Sunday as part of the American Diabetes Association's annual meeting, in Orlando, Fla.\n\nFor people with type 1 diabetes, controlling their blood sugar levels is a full-time job. Too much insulin can cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), which can be life-threatening, while too little causes the serious damage of diabetes such as kidney, vision and circulation problems.\n\n\"The promise in the near term of these technologies is not only to help us reduce significantly the risk of long-term diabetic complications, but also to reduce the risk of having a catastrophic hypoglycemic event, and further help people with diabetes live easier,\" Aaron Kowalski, research director of the JDRF's Artificial Pancreas Project, said during the teleconference.\n\n\"This will help keep people healthy while we drive toward a biological approach, which will take longer,\" he said.\n\nIn the first report, Dr. Roman Hovorka, a principal research associate in the department of pediatrics at the University of Cambridge, reported that the technology can significantly improve overnight blood sugar control in adults without the fear of developing hypoglycemia. With the technology, patients maintained their blood sugar levels within the target range for 70 percent of the time, compared to 47 percent of the time among those not using the technology.\n\nMoreover, glucose control was demonstrated in real-life situations such as after a large meal and having a glass of white wine.\n\n\"We let them consume about three-quarters of a bottle of wine to simulate what happens after a large meal,\" Hovorka said during Saturday's teleconference. \"What has been shown is that drinking alcohol in the evening causes hypoglycemia early in the morning.\"\n\nThese results were similar to findings in children where the system extended the amount of time spent at target blood sugar levels, he added. \"We reduced hypoglycemia by half,\" he said.\n\n\"Our plan is to move into home studies, which hopefully will happen later on this year,\" Hovorka said.\n\nMeanwhile, Marilyn Ritholz, a senior psychologist at the Joslin Diabetes Center and an assistant professor of psychology at the Harvard Medical School, reported on a study on psychological barriers to continuous blood sugar monitoring.\n\n\"So far, studies have not shown which factors predict which factors are associated with successful or unsuccessful continuous glucose monitoring [CGM],\" she said during the teleconference.\n\nRitholz's team found that people who were better at coping with the frustration of using the device were more successful at keeping their blood sugar under control.\n\nFrustrations included warning alarms and problems at the insertion point of the device. \"We found that the people who did well used a more problem-solving approach and persisted in trying to learn how to use the CGM,\" she said.\n\nPeople who were not successful used \"emotion-based coping,\" Ritholz said. \"They easily became overwhelmed and they just gave up.\"\n\nIn addition, successful people had more involvement and support from their spouse or \"significant other,\" she added. All patients felt self-conscious wearing the device, Ritholz noted.\n\n\"We know that CGM success or failure is as dependent on the human experience as it is on the perfection of the technology,\" she said.\n\nSpeaking at the Saturday teleconference, Dr. William Tamborlane, chief of pediatric endocrinology at Yale University School of Medicine and co-chair of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's Continuous Glucose Monitoring Group, said the system only works if worn almost every day.\n\nStudies have shown that children and adults over 25 who used CGM were able to reduce their blood sugar levels. However, teenagers did not see a benefit, probably because they were less likely to wear the device, Tamborlane said.\n\nPeople who used the device more than six days per week saw improvement, regardless of age, he added.\n\nTo get more people to use CGM, \"the industry needs to come up with better systems and better devices,\" he said.\n\nArtificial pancreas technology combines CGM with an insulin pump and a sophisticated computer program that controls when and how much insulin to deliver.\n\nThe device delivers two hormones that are deficient in type 1 diabetes -- insulin, which keeps blood sugar levels from going too high after a meal, and glucagon, a naturally occurring hormone that prevents blood sugar levels from dropping too low.\n\nHowever, the complicated computer algorithm for the pump system is still being developed.\n\nFor more information on type 1 diabetes, visit the American Diabetes Association.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The investigator is quoted as saying that \"We reduced hypoglycemia by half.\" There\u2019s a dissonant choir of problems with this statement. First, it\u2019s not clear from the sentence\u2019s placement in the article if this result came in the prior study with children or in the current study with adults. (The rest of these points assume the latter.)\nSecond, the article doesn\u2019t identify the comparator group (those who just used the insulin pump), so a relative result is meaningless. So when the claim is made, \"We reduced hypoglycemia by half,\" readers should be told \"half of what?\" \nThird, the fact that they used a relative risk reduction figure, not an absolute one, is important because this study was so short and small, using relative risk reductions masks the weight (or thinness)\u00a0of the evidence, especially when we don\u2019t have the statistical significance. \nFourth, we\u2019re not sure what data the investigator\u2019s statement of reducing \"hypoglycemia by half\"\u00a0is based on. In\u00a0the\u00a0abstract, it\u2019s says that the time spent below target glucose was approximately half but\u00a0the difference was not\u00a0statistically significant, no doubt due to the small power and short duration of the study. If our interpretation is correct, the story\u2019s author has touted a benefit that\u2019s insignificant, statistically speaking.\nFifth, it should\u2019ve been clearer about what \"reduced hypoglycemia\" mean? The total time spent below target glucose range \u2014 which averaged out over the course of the study \u2014 is different than a (severe) hypoglycemic event, which some readers may read in this result. How dangerous is it to spend any time below the target range, if only temporary and possibly briefly? In other words, is it a harm or an efficacy issue? In the\u00a0abstract, we read about 1 serious case of hypoglycemia \u00a0with the insulin pump, 0 with the closed-loop system; but again, with 12 patients using each for a night, statistically we\u2019re not sure what that tells us.\u00a0\nRegardless of the true intent of this statement, and the true harms that occurred in the study, an independent analysis may have clarified such confusions.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Last year, in an operating room at the University of Toronto, a 63-year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease experienced something she hadn't for 55 years: a memory of her 8-year-old self playing with her siblings on their family farm in Scotland. \n\n \n\n The woman is a patient of Dr. Andres Lozano, a neurosurgeon who is among a growing number of researchers studying the potential of deep brain stimulation to treat Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. If the approach pans out, it could provide options for patients with fading cognition and retrieve vanished memories.\n\nRight now, deep brain stimulation is used primarily to treat Parkinson's disease and tremor, for which it's approved by the Food and Drug Administration. DBS involves delivering electrical impulses to specific areas of the brain through implanted electrodes. The technique is also approved for obsessive-compulsive disorder and is being looked at for a number of other brain disorders, including depression, chronic pain and, as in Lozano's work, dementia.\n\nIn 2008, Lozano's group published a study in which an obese patient was treated with deep brain stimulation of the hypothalamus. Though no bigger than a pea, the hypothalamus is a crucial bit of brain involved in appetite regulation and other bodily essentials such as temperature control, sleep and circadian rhythms. It seemed like a reasonable target in trying to suppress excessive hunger. To the researcher's surprise, following stimulation the patient reported a sensation of deja vu. He also perceived feeling 20 years younger and recalled a memory of being in a park with friends, including an old girlfriend. With increasing voltages, his memories became more vivid, including remembering their clothes.\n\nUsing a 3-dimensional brain mapping technique called standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography, or sLORETA, Lozano's group uncovered an explanation for the unexpected findings. They found that stimulating the hypothalamus was in turn driving increased brain activity in the hippocampus, a key cog in the brain's memory circuitry. As Alzheimer's progresses, not only does the hypothalamus atrophy, but electrical communication between neurons in the region also gradually becomes impaired.\n\nThat our memories \u2014 so entwined with our personalities and senses of self \u2014 might be so vulnerable to a brown out is, existentially speaking, rather alarming. There's something palpably dehumanizing about reducing our past selves to the exchange of electricity between neurons, and also about retrieving memories by hot-wiring the brain.\n\nYet the prospect of the latter is undeniably intriguing. Given that Alzheimer's affects 1 in 9 people over the age of 65 and that current therapies are in many patients dismally ineffective, Lozano felt all but obligated to dig further. His group launched a test in six patients and published the results in the Annals of Neurology in 2010.\n\nThe study included patients with mild and severe disease who received stimulation in the fornix continuously for 1 year. \"The fornix is like the highway leading into the hippocampus,\" explains Lozano. \"It's easier to stimulate than the hippocampus itself and crucial to memory function.\" As expected those with more severe disease continued to mentally deteriorate, however it appeared that in those with mild disease, cognitive decline slowed with stimulation.\n\nNext, Lozano launched a randomized trial involving 42 patients from the US and Canada, all of whom had electrodes implanted in the fornix on both sides of the brain. In half the patients the stimulation was turned on right away. In the other half the stimulation wasn't turned on for a year, though they didn't know it.\n\nPreliminary results, published in December 2015 in the Journal of Neurosurgery, were mixed but encouraging.\n\nGiven that so few people have had electrical stimulation applied to memory circuits, perhaps the most significant finding was that both the surgery itself and DBS of the fornix appear safe. No serious long-term neurological side effects were seen in either patient group, supporting future research in the field.\n\nIn terms of efficacy, however, after one year there were no significant differences in cognition between the groups, as measured by two scales commonly used to measure Alzheimer's disease symptoms, the ADAS-Cog and CDR-SB. Alzheimer's tends to progress slowly and reversing or slowing the neurodegeneration associated with condition may take time to become noticeable. Lozano's final results won't be reported until four years out.\n\nMore intriguing for now were comparisons of glucose utilization. Glucose is our brains' primary fuel. The degree to which glucose is burned is a commonly used measure of brain activity. Patients with Alzheimer's typically have reduced glucose activity in their brains, as well as, again, shrinking memory circuits. The older patients in Lozano's study who had stimulation turned on exhibited markedly increased glucose use in the brain's memory regions. Not only that, the hippocampus of some study patients who received DBS actually increased in size.\n\nReversing withering hippocampi by encouraging the growth of new neurons is seen as a holy grail in Alzheimer's research, and Lozano's finding is supported by a recent animal study demonstrating that DBS in rats causes the release of growth factors that induce neuronal growth in the hippocampus.\n\nLozano acknowledges that retrieving childhood memories, which he says has occurred in about one-third of his patents \u2014 requires lofty voltages that he would be uncomfortable sending patients home on. Yet he's encouraged by the early findings that suggest the procedure is safe. \"We also know that in patients who receive stimulation there is an increase in glucose utilization in memory areas of the brain,\" he says, a finding that could mean there's a way to overcome some of the damage from Alzheimer's.\n\nEvidence supporting DBS in dementia is emerging from other research groups as well. A 2012 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that in seven patients receiving DBS to a brain region called the entorhinal cortex, spatial memory improved \u2013 meaning they could more easily remember the locations of newly learned landmarks. The entorhinal cortex works in concert with the hippocampus to solidify memories.\n\nA group at the University of Cologne in Germany is instead focusing on delivering DBS to a part of the brain called the nucleus basalis of Meynert, another region in which impaired neuron function is thought to contribute to Alzheimer's. Last year they published a study in Molecular Psychiatry in which four of six patients either remained cognitively stable or improved in response to DBS, as measured by the ADAS-cog. Like in Lozano's study no serious side effects were seen.\n\nDespite the mounting evidence for DBS, not everyone is convinced.\n\nReferring to Lozano's second clinical study, Dr. Nader Pouratian, a neurosurgeon and DBS researcher at UCLA, comments, \"The recent deep brain stimulation trial for Alzheimer's disease clearly demonstrates the safety of this approach for trying to treat the progression of disease. Unfortunately, [the findings] suggest that the therapy may not be as robust as initially proposed.\"\n\nHowever he acknowledges Lozano's results suggest that DBS to the fornix might be promising for a subgroup of patients, those being older people with less severe disease.\n\n\"The most promising areas are likely the fornix or the entorhinal area,\" he says. \"But I believe further studies are necessary to better elucidate the efficacy of this treatment before proceeding to a larger scale randomized trial.\"\n\nIn a 2008 episode of the medical television drama House, the show's main character Dr. Gregory House survives a bus crash that leaves his memory murky. In an attempt to remember the medical history of a fellow collision victim \u2013 and inspired by Lozano's initial paper \u2014 House voluntarily undergoes deep brain stimulation. Following the procedure the grouchy TV doctor's memory returns. As is customary on the show, he cracks the case.\n\nDBS for treatment of Alzheimer's and other dementias is a field in its infancy. Unlike on TV, in all likelihood it won't be widely used anytime soon to retrieve specific memories. \"Even though House did this, we're not doing it yet,\" cautions Lozano.\n\nYet the fact that the therapy can in some people rescue recollections \u2013 albeit random ones \u2013 and possibly induce new neuron growth in memory regions of the brain seems reason enough to pursue it further.\n\n\"We're hoping to use electricity to drive activity in areas of the brain involved in memory and cognition,\" says Lozano. \"We want to turn these brain networks back on.\"\n\nBret Stetka is a writer based in New York and an editorial director at Medscape.

Low back pain affects men and women equally.\n\nMost back pain is short-term, but about 20 percent of people affected by acute low back pain go on to develop chronic low back pain lasting a year or more.

That compares to about 5 percent of patients given the standard therapy, interleukin, the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) says.\n\nThat means 60 percent of patients are not living that long \u2014 but it\u2019s still far more than the usual 11-month survival with advanced melanoma.\n\n\u201cIt is definitely a huge benefit over what we have seen in the past,\u201d said ASCO president Dr. Julie Vose, a specialist in blood cancers at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.\n\nMelanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. It will be diagnosed in more than 76,000 Americans this year, according to the American Cancer Society, and it will kill 10,000.\n\nRates are rising, in part because tanning became fashionable. Melanoma is easy to cure when caught early, but it is often hard to tell if a mole or freckle has turned cancerous. Carter, for example, was only diagnosed once the tumors had spread to his brain, last fall.\n\nThat\u2019s Stage IV cancer and it\u2019s almost always deadly at that stage.

About 15 percent of these patients have what\u2019s called a complete remission, meaning there is no trace of their tumors. That doesn\u2019t mean a cure \u2014 it\u2019s too soon to say that \u2014 but it does mean months or years of cancer-free life that they otherwise could not have hoped for.\n\nAnd 61 of the patients, or 9 percent, have stopped taking the drug after their tumors went away. Virtually all of them are still in remission.\n\n\u201cThis is huge in the melanoma community,\u201d said Tim Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation.\n\n\u201cIt's difficult to know at what point you call it a cure. For the patient, though, it means they are cancer-free and for some of those patients, it is likely that their cancer never will come back,\u201d Turnham told NBC News.\n\n\u201cWhen this study was started the average life expectancy of someone with advanced melanoma was 11 months and now we're seeing that a large percentage of people are living at least three years.\u201d\n\nKeytruda \u2014 known generically as pembrolizumab \u2014 targets the activity of genes called PD-1 (anti-programmed-death-receptor-1) and PD-L1. The interaction between the two genes lets some tumors escape detection and destruction by immune system cells.\n\nPD-1 stops immune cells from attacking normal healthy cells by mistake. Tumor cells make PD-L1 turn on PD-1 when immune cells approach. Keytruda, an engineered immune protein called a monoclonal antibody, disrupts this signal and lets the immune cells attack the tumor cell.\n\nThe drug works far better in patients whose tumors express more PD-1, meaning they have a lot of PD-1 activity, so the drug will optimally be used jointly with a test for PD-1. There are side-effects, including fatigue, itchiness and rash. It was bad enough for 8 percent of patients that they stopped taking it.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration gave Keytruda accelerated approval for melanoma in 2014. It's got breakthrough therapy designation for Hodgkin's lymphoma and colon cancer and got accelerated approval for lung cancer.\n\n\u201cIn a matter of a few years, these therapies have truly transformed the outlook for patients with melanoma and many other hard-to-treat cancers,\u201d said Dr. Don Dizon, an oncologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and a spokesman for ASCO.\n\nKeytruda's being tested in other cancer types now.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the FDA gave accelerated approval to a drug that works in a similar way.\n\nIt approved Tecentriq, known generically as atezolizumab, for use in patients with advanced bladder cancer.\n\nLike Keytruda, Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody. It goes straight to PD-L1, so its target is slightly different.\n\nFDA\u2019s approval was made on the basis of a trial that showed 12 percent of patients with advanced bladder cancer who had high levels of PD-L1 activity saw their tumors disappear, compared to 5.5 percent of patients on other treatments. Another 14 percent had a partial response, meaning their tumors shrank a little, compared to 9.4 percent on standard treatment.\n\nThe drugs must be infused and they are pricey.

With this successful Phase 3 trial, insurers will now be more likely to pay for such off-label use.\n\nSome doctors criticized the organizers of the trial for testing Lucentis rather than another Genentech drug, Avastin, which works in the same way as Lucentis.\n\nAlthough it is a cancer drug, Avastin is often used off-label for eye diseases because it is far cheaper than Lucentis, costing only $20 to $100 a dose, compared with $2,000 for Lucentis.\n\nAvastin is undercutting sales of Lucentis, which totaled $1.1 billion in the United States last year.\n\nOrganizers of the trial conceded that a major reason Lucentis was chosen was that Genentech, which is now owned by Roche, agreed to provide the drug free of charge and to contribute $9 million in additional financing \u2014 but only if Lucentis were used.\n\n\u201cObviously you can\u2019t underplay $9 million,\u201d said Dr. Ferris of the eye institute, which is part of the part of the National Institutes of Health.

In macular edema, fluid from those damaged vessels leaks into the macula, the part of the retina that is responsible for the straight-ahead vision important for driving, recognizing faces and reading.\n\nLucentis, also known as ranibizumab, works by drying up leaky blood vessels and preventing the growth of new ones.\n\nJohn Bevan, who has diabetic macular edema, said that every two months or so he used to have an incident in which blood leaked into his eye, blurring his vision.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a paintball hits a plate-glass window \u2014 there\u2019s a big splat and it drips downward and takes three days to a week to dissipate,\u201d said Mr. Bevan, the school superintendent in north central Indiana.

There were four treatment groups: One group got Lucentis injections into the eye as often as every four weeks, plus laser therapy. Another got Lucentis, with laser therapy used only after six months and only if needed. The third group got laser therapy plus injections into the eye of triamcinolone, a steroid sold by Allergan under the name Trivaris. The fourth group got laser therapy plus a sham injection.\n\nAfter the first year, only 3 to 4 percent of the eyes treated with Lucentis suffered a visual loss of two or more lines compared to 13 percent that got only laser therapy.\n\nResearchers said the results seem to be holding up for the second year of the three-year trial.\n\nAbout 1 percent of those getting Lucentis injections suffered an inflammation of the eye from an infection.\n\nThe steroid treatment did not improve eyesight more than laser therapy alone and caused side effects.\n\nResults of the trial were published online on Tuesday by the journal Ophthalmology.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "\u00a0While the story did include the common side effect of the drug in the study, there were other potentially important complications that were not mentioned.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Philadelphia, PA, June 2, 2016 - Basal cell carcinoma is one of the most common cancers and its incidence is increasing worldwide, putting a significant burden on health services. Topical treatments are available for superficial basal cell carcinoma (BCC) but there has a lack of long-term follow-up data to guide treatment decisions. A three-year randomized controlled clinical trial has found that two topical creams are effective in most primary, low-risk superficial BCC, comparing favorably with photodynamic therapy (PDT), as reported by investigators in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology.\n\nMore than 80% of all skin cancers are BCC, arising from the basal cells (i.e., small, round cells found in the lower layer of the epidermis). There are over two million cases a year in the U.S. and the lifetime risk of developing a BCC before the age of 85 years is one in five people. The prognosis is excellent, but it can cause significant disfigurement by invading surrounding tissues.\n\nWhile most types of BCC require surgery, superficial BCC can be treated topically with noninvasive treatments such as PDT, imiquimod cream, fluorouracil cream, cryosurgery or electrodessication and curettage.\n\nInvestigators in the Netherlands report the results of a three-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial that compared three noninvasive treatments that included imiquimod and fluorouracil cream. \"The main advantages of noninvasive treatments are good cosmetic outcome, preservation of surrounding tissue, and potential for home application of either creams,\" explained lead investigator Marieke Roozeboom of the Department of Dermatology, Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands. \"Throughout the last two decades there has been a growing interest in these non-surgical therapies, which offer the possibility of avoiding surgery and reducing demands on busy medical practices.\"\n\nHowever, prior to this study there has been a lack of randomized controlled trials with a long-term follow-up that compare the effectiveness of noninvasive treatments. Consequently, there is no consensus in international BCC guidelines on the first choice of noninvasive therapy for superficial BCC.\n\nA total of 601 patients with a superficial BCC participated in this study: 202 patients were treated with methylaminolevulinate photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT), 198 with imiquimod cream, and 201 with fluorouracil cream. The three study groups had a similar distribution of baseline characteristics, with the exception of tumor size.\n\nAround 80% of patients with superficial BCC were tumor free after imiquimod treatment after three years. The clearance rate was 68% for patients treated with fluorouracil and 58% for individuals receiving PDT.\n\n\"Based on our findings, both imiquimod and fluorouracil are effective noninvasive treatments in most primary, low-risk superficial BCC, but the data provide no definite evidence for superiority of imiquimod to fluorouracil,\" commented Dr. Roozeboom. \"Both creams have an equal cosmetic outcome and risk of local adverse events. Fluorouracil has the advantage of being less expensive than imiquimod. However, between one- and three-year follow-up, more recurrences were diagnosed in the fluorouracil group compared with the imiquimod group.\"\n\n\"When choosing a treatment for an individual patient with a superficial BCC, other factors like age, compliance, and patient preferences should always be taken into account. For example, we have found that in superficial BCC on the lower extremities in older patients, PDT should be prescribed rather than imiquimod. Our evidence indicates that a personalized treatment approach is necessary,\" added Dr. Roozeboom.\n\n\"Three year follow-up results of photodynamic therapy versus imiquimod versus fluorouracil for treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma: a single blind, noninferiority, randomized controlled trial,\" by Marieke H.

That same visit, the lightning pain going down his back went away, and he got up and walked out. That\u2019s amazing. By the fifth visit, he was completely out of pain,\u201d Fuh said.\n\nIn nonsurgical spinal decompression, a patient is placed on a special type of table with harnesses on the pelvis and rib cage. The back is gently stretched over a number of treatments, allowing the disc to rehydrate and heal.\n\nResearch has shown an 86 percent to 94 percent success rate with decompression. It is designed for patients who have not had surgery.\n\nThe treatment, which includes several 20-minute procedures and rehabilitation, costs between $3,500 and $4,000. It is less than half the cost of surgery but is rarely covered by insurance.\n\nThe idea is based on results from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The space agency noticed astronauts, who did not have gravity compressing their spines in space, reporting the disappearance of neck and back pain. Some of them returned to Earth 1 inch to 2 inches taller.\n\nA neurosurgeon adapted the concept for clinical treatment, and several companies began to make beds for spinal decompression.\n\nThe new beds, Fuh said, are much different than similar beds made 20 years ago where patients would lie on their stomachs, put a strap around their pelvis and \u201chold onto handle bars for dear life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe table now, you just lay on your back, and the machine does all of the work.

There is a group in Iowa that doesn\u2019t do surgery anymore because they have found more success with this,\u201d Fuh said.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not mention any potential harms of this approach.

The study is the first to show that a point-of-care EVD test (ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test; Corgenix) is faster than and as sensitive as a conventional laboratory-based molecular method used for clinical testing during the recent outbreak in Sierra Leone.\n\nThis new rapid diagnostic test (RDT) could cut back on the lengthy process usually required to confirm if a patient has EVD, help identify case contacts, and ultimately curb the spread of Ebola.\n\nCurrently, diagnosis of EVD requires a full vial of venous blood to be shipped to a laboratory with a high level of biosafety and staff expertise for testing by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This method poses substantial risks to the healthcare workers responsible for blood collection, transport, and testing, and efforts to contain the Ebola epidemic in west Africa have been hampered by this slow and complex diagnostic test.\n\n\"Laboratory results can sometimes take days to return. Delays like this result not only in the failure to diagnose and treat Ebola-infected patients, but also in individuals without Ebola being admitted to holding units where they may be subsequently infected with the virus,\" [1] explains Dr Nira Pollock, senior author and Associate Medical Director of the Infectious Diseases Diagnostic Laboratory at the Boston Children's Hospital, USA.\n\n\"This new test, on the other hand, is capable of detecting the Ebola virus in just a small drop of blood tested at the bedside, and could help us in the fight against Ebola.\" [1]\n\nIn this study, the researchers compared the diagnostic accuracy of the new RDT against the benchmark RT-PCR test (altona Diagnostics) being used for clinical diagnosis in the field reference laboratory run by Public Health England at Port Loko in Sierra Leone.\n\n106 suspected Ebola patients admitted to two treatment centres in Sierra Leone (run by the Ministry of Health and Sanitation of Sierra Leone and supported by the non-governmental organisation Partners In Health) during February 2015 were tested by both RDT (performed on a fingerstick blood sample at the point-of-care) and by standard RT-PCR (performed on plasma in the laboratory). Both RDT (on whole blood) and RT-PCR (on plasma) were also performed on 284 samples in the laboratory.\n\nThe RDT detected all confirmed cases of EVD that were positive by RT-PCR in both point-of-care (28/105 patients) and laboratory testing (45/277 patients), with sensitivity of 100% (identifying all patients with EVD as per the benchmark method), and a specificity of 92% (identifying patients who didn't have EVD).\n\nSurprisingly, the findings also revealed that the standard altona RT-PCR test, under the conditions deployed in the field, was itself an imperfect reference standard. The altona RT-PCR assay failed to detect a small number of EVD cases that tested positive by both RDT and by an alternative RT-PCR test (Trombley), all with relatively low amounts of virus. Both the RDT and altona assays failed to detect a small number of EVD cases that tested positive by the Trombley test, all with very low amounts of virus. The authors caution that given the limitations of the performance of the altona RT-PCR reference test in patients with low levels of the virus in their blood, more research is needed to assess how the new RDT will perform in patients very early in the course of EVD.\n\nAccording to co-author Dr Jana Broadhurst from Partners In Health, Boston, USA, \"This test could have an immediate impact on patient care and infection control by reliably detecting patients well into their illness who are likely to be highly infectious. Earlier test results would improve triage of patients, enabling staff to focus on those most likely to have Ebola, and reducing the opportunity for infection of non-Ebola 'suspects'. Although the RDT requires refrigeration, this is already available in many health centres in endemic areas, particularly those that store vaccines and other medical products.\" [1]\n\nWriting in a linked Comment, Dr Nahid Bhadelia from Boston University School of Medicine and Boston Medical Center, Boston, USA says, \"[This study] validates the accuracy of the ReEBOV RDT in patients who are well into their illness...suggesting it could be used to triage this subset of patients if RT-PCR is not available, particularly in those with a high index of clinical suspicion for a differential diagnosis...the data presented provide crucial information about the point of-care function of this rapid diagnostic test, such as ease of use, quality of samples taken at the bedside, and the concordance with venous samples...the results raise caution regarding the performance of the widely used altona RT-PCR assay, which the authors suggest might have underperformed because of laboratory specific technical and performance factors.\"\n\nThis study was funded by a gift from the Abundance Foundation (Stephen Kahn).

Teixobactin is a recently discovered natural antibiotic which many in the international scientific community believe could lead to creation of the first commercially viable new antibiotic drug in 30 years.\n\nThe Lincoln team has successfully synthesized new simplified versions of teixobactin which harness the same powerful antibiotic effects in a way that could be produced on a commercial scale. Their findings are published in the Royal Society of Chemistry's journal, Chemical Science.\n\nUntil now, scientists attempting to synthesise teixobactin believed they needed to use cationic (or positively charged) amino acids which bind to the bacterial target using a 'side chain'. This meant they had to use either the very rare amino acid found naturally in teixobactin, called enduracididine, or alternative ones which had lower potency against superbugs.\n\nEach amino acid sits at a specific place in teixobactin's structure, and the Lincoln team has now successfully replaced enduracididine - which holds position ten - with two alternative amino acids which are not positively charged. These amino acids lack the 'binding' part, over-turning the prior understanding that enduracididine is essential for to so-called 'target binding' to be highly potent against superbugs.\n\nWith this new knowledge, synthesised versions of teixobactin can be more easily developed, taking the process from up to 30 hours to just ten minutes for a single coupling step - a significant step towards turning teixobactin into a viable new drug. Importantly, the two new simplified forms of teixobactin have also proven to have identical potency against superbugs as the natural form of teixobactin.\n\nDr Ishwar Singh, a specialist in novel drug design and development from the University of Lincoln's School of Pharmacy, is leading the research team. He explained: \"When teixobactin was discovered it was ground breaking in itself as a new antibiotic which kills bacteria without detectable resistance including superbugs such as MRSA. We have been investigating a way to simplify the design while retaining the high potency against resistant bacteria such as MRSA.\n\n\"This simplified design and more efficient synthesise will enable work to be carried out at a commercial level. Enduracididine was severely limiting our ability to do this because of its scarcity, a complex multistep synthesis, and long and repetitive steps of between 16 and 30 hours with high failure rate and very low yields.\n\n\"We needed to make a change to the structure so that we could make the molecule more viable for drug development. We had tried replacing it with other amino acids with a similar make up, but they all were less potent in comparison to the natural form of teixobactin. Now, we have discovered that we can in fact use amino acids which are structurally different, and are commercially-available. They are also 16 times more potent than a clinically-used antibiotic in killing the superbug MRSA, and they were also highly potent against other antibiotic-resistant infections, such as vancomycin resistant enterococci, and tuberculosis.\"\n\nThe work builds on the success of the team's pioneering research to tackle antimicrobial resistance over the past 18 months. Dr Singh is working with colleagues from the School of Life Sciences and the School of Chemistry at the University of Lincoln to develop teixobactins into a viable drug.\n\nIt has been predicted that by 2050 an additional 10 million people will succumb to drug resistant infections each year. The development of new antibiotics which can be used as a last resort when other drugs are ineffective is therefore a crucial area of study for healthcare researchers around the world.", "question": "Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The release does not address potential harms.

According to a network meta-analysis research article published in the May 1, 2018 issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (JAAOS), the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) naproxen was ranked most effective in individual knee OA treatment for improving both pain and function, and is considered a relatively safe and low-cost treatment method.\n\nNonsurgical treatments for knee OA supported by previous research evidence include strength training, low-impact aerobic exercises, NSAIDs, and weight loss in individuals with a body mass index over 25. This new research analyzed data from multiple trials to determine the relative effectiveness of various nonsurgical treatments for knee OA. The treatments that were compared and ranked included acetaminophen; ibuprofen; intra-articular (IA) or joint injections of cortisone; platelet-rich plasma (PRP); hyaluronic acid (HA); several NSAIDs, such as naproxen, celecoxib, and diclofenac; and both oral and IA placebo.\n\n\"This is the first comprehensive mixed-comparison analysis comparing best-evidence scientific research and excluding lower quality studies that can bias the outcomes,\" said lead author and orthopaedic surgeon David Jevsevar, MD, MBA. \"Using a statistical ranking technique, we worked to provide evidence regarding which of the most common NSAIDs are most likely to decrease pain and improve function, and we attempted to fill in the gaps in evidence for more inconclusive treatments such as HA, PRP, and corticosteroids.\"\n\nAuthors analyzed 53 randomized controlled trials that examined knee OA treatments for at least 28 days and included a minimum of 30 participants per study group. Knee OA treatments were ranked on a scale of one to five, with one being the most effective. They found the following:\n\u2022 For pain reduction, cortisone injections provided the greatest short-term (4 to 6 weeks) pain relief, followed by ibuprofen, PRP injections, naproxen, and celecoxib.\n\u2022 Naproxen ranked the highest for probability for improving function, followed by diclofenac, celecoxib, ibuprofen, and PRP injections.\n\u2022 Naproxen was ranked the most effective individual knee OA treatment for improving both pain and function followed by cortisone injections, PRP injections, ibuprofen and celecoxib.\n\u2022 HA injections did not achieve a rank in the top five treatments for pain, function, or combined pain and function. An analysis of 12 articles also found that results with HA are not significantly different from those with IA placebo for treatment of knee OA.\n\n\"Because knee OA has both a high disease burden and high treatment costs, additional prospective studies using similar outcomes, timelines, and measures of clinically important changes are needed,\" explained Dr. Jevsevar. \"While the information in this analysis is helpful to physicians, patients also can benefit from these findings and use it with their doctors to weigh all possible treatment options.\"\n\nAlthough the use of NSAIDs for arthritic conditions such as knee OA has potential risks, including heart attack and stroke, existing evidence indicates that naproxen has less potential for adverse cardiovascular events.\n\nMore information about the AAOS and JAAOS\n\nFollow the AAOS on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram \n\nFollow the conversation about JAAOS on Twitter\n\nFrom the Department of Orthopaedics, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH (Dr. Jevsevar), American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, Rosemont, IL (Mr. Shores, Mr. Mullen, Ms. Schulte, and Dr. Cummins), and Franciscan Orthopedic Associates, Tacoma, WA (Dr. Brown).

The British research found no negative effects of such light drinking on 5-year-olds whose mothers had imbibed while pregnant with them. Indeed, these kindergartners were slightly less likely to have behavioral problems and performed somewhat better on cognitive tests than children whose mothers had abstained. (More on Time.com: 5 Pregnancy Taboos Explained (or Debunked))\n\nBut this does *not* mean that light drinking in pregnancy is good for your baby. When researchers controlled for factors like maternal education and income, which tend to be higher in light drinkers, it significantly reduced the positive effects associated with alcohol. For example, before adjusting for these kinds of differences between the groups, the researchers found that light drinking was connected with 33% lower rates of overall behavior problems in boys \u2014 after the adjustment, that effect fell to 23%.\n\nThe study did find negative effects in children whose mothers drank moderately: this was defined as not having more than 3 to 6 British units of alcohol per week or more than 3 to 5 units on a single occasion. (One British unit of alcohol equals a small glass of wine.) Heavier drinking in pregnancy, not surprisingly, resulted in increased levels of behavior problems and lowered cognitive performance among children.\n\nThe research included 11,513 children participating in a large U.K. study. The authors had earlier published similar results looking at the data for children in the study when they were 3, finding those whose mothers who didn\u2019t drink had slightly more behavior problems and slightly poorer performance on mental tests than kids born to light drinkers; the results also showed increasingly negative effects of alcohol going from moderate to heavy drinking. Other research has repeatedly shown that heavy, binging patterns of consumption are most dangerous to the developing child. (More on Time.com: If I\u2019m Drunk, Then You Stepped On My Toes On Purpose)\n\nInterestingly, the new study parallels the effects of alcohol on health more generally; lighter drinkers tend to do better than teetotalers while the heaviest drinkers do worse. (But see here for coverage of a study that found even heavy drinkers beat abstainers when it comes to mortality in mid- to late life.)\n\nYet previous research in the area of maternal drinking has repeatedly found negative effects from even the lowest levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. This data is notoriously hard to interpret, however, in part because it is based on women\u2019s self-reports: the public health message against drinking during pregnancy has been so widely adopted that women who do drink may significantly underreport their consumption to researchers. If women who say they are drinking at \u201clight\u201d levels are actually drinking at moderately or heavily, that might make the data on light drinking look more dangerous than they are.\n\n\n\nWhatever the case, American health authorities remain united in their advice that no amount of alcohol is safe for the fetus during pregnancy \u2014 and anyone who is familiar with fetal alcohol syndrome knows why. But for those women who drink before finding out they\u2019re pregnant or who have an occasional glass of wine afterward, this study can provide reassurance that very low levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy are unlikely to cause serious problems.\n\nEven More Evidence for the Health Benefits of Drinking\n\nPhotos: What Booze Looks like Under a Microscope", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not put a number to the \"increased levels of behavior problems and lowered cognitive performance among children.\" It should have.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Through an article in Forbes I saw that a new study has been published about the safety of Gardasil, a vaccine for prevention of certain strains of human papillomavirus, or HPV.\n\nHPV is a virus that can lead to genital warts, many types of cancer, and cervical cancer in women, which kills 4,000 women every year in the U.S. alone.\n\nThe Gardasil vaccine, on the other hand, caused some people to faint after getting it, and others got mild skin infections\u2014both of which occur somewhat rarely with other vaccines too, as you might expect.\n\nWhich sounds worse to you?\n\nThe study, published in the Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal, looked at the published data about effects from the vaccine and found that it has a \u201cfavorable safety profile.\u201d This study comes after many other previous studies that show essentially the same thing. There is no correlation between getting the Gardasil vaccine and seriously adverse effects such as \u201cautoimmune diseases (including Guillain-Barre Syndrome and multiple sclerosis), anaphylaxis, venous thromboembolism, and stroke.\u201d\n\nMind you, all these things and more have been used by people who attack vaccines as an argument against it. And, just like essentially every claim made by the anti-vaccination movement, these arguments are wrong.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t stop them from making them, or from them getting attention by mainstream media; attention they most assuredly do not deserve.\n\nIt\u2019s very frustrating; mounds of data show these vaccinations are incredibly low-risk, but it only takes a little bit of doubt and fear to make vaccine rates drop. For example, a young girl died tragically not long after getting the vaccine, and it got a lot of press, but it was later found that she died of a completely unrelated cause. This, sadly, is expected; more than 178 million doses of Gardasil have been given worldwide, and given that huge number it\u2019s a statistical certainty that some young people will die not long after getting them. But as the saying goes, correlation is not causation. The vaccines are not to blame here.\n\nEven more frustrating about this vaccine is that it\u2019s being fought by an unusual group of people; while most anti-vax leanings are not affiliated with any particular political persuasion, Gardasil gets attacked additionally by conservatives who think that girls getting it will become more promiscuous, because HPV is a sexually transmitted disease.\n\nHowever, this has been shown to be false. Worse, these same people tend to promote abstinence-only education, which has been shown conclusively to be the worst possible sex education; kids taught his way tend to have more pregnancies and more STIs than ones who are taught progressive, healthy sex ed.\n\nIt\u2019s like Bizarro world, where everything is backward. All the evidence shows Gardasil to be safe and to be effective against a virus that causes horrific illnesses. It also shows that the claims made by anti-vaxxers are wrong, and that people fighting the vaccine because of their own sexual biases are making things far worse.\n\nAnd yet they dig in. They insist real science is wrong, that their anecdotes are better, that the entire medical industry is on the take (which is silly beyond reason).\n\nBut that\u2019s where we are. When it comes to health issues, especially ones tied to sexuality, reason goes out the window and emotions take over.\n\nThat\u2019s why I am very, very clear about this: I and my family are all up to date with our vaccinations, and my daughter has had all three stages of the Gardasil vaccine (we\u2019d have done that if she had been a boy, too).

Close to one in four of the men in both groups combined had ever taken a statin.\n\nThe researchers found that men who died of prostate cancer were half as likely to have taken a statin at any time, and for any duration, than men in the \u201ccontrol\u201d group.\n\nWhen they accounted for whether or not men were overweight and their other health problems and medications, it turned out that those with fatal cancers were 63 percent less likely to have ever taken a statin, according to findings published in Cancer.\n\nBut, Marcella added, \u201cI would not tell a person if they don\u2019t have a risk of heart disease, (if) they don\u2019t have hypertension...to take a statin just to prevent lethal prostate cancer.\u201d\n\nThe evidence that\u2019s effective, he said, just isn\u2019t there yet.\n\nAnd even if statins do turn out to help prevent fatal prostate cancer, researchers said, previous studies have suggested they don\u2019t lower a man\u2019s risk of getting less aggressive forms of the disease.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, about one in every six men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point, and one in every 36 men will die of the disease.\n\nMarcella\u2019s team didn\u2019t have the data to figure out if taking a statin for longer, or starting one earlier, was more beneficial than more limited use of the drugs.\n\nThe researchers also couldn\u2019t tell whether men started using statins before or after they were diagnosed with aggressive cancer.\n\nBut they did find that while high-potency, often newer statins were linked to a lower risk of fatal prostate cancer, lower-potency drugs were not. That suggests it\u2019s something about the drugs themselves that lower men\u2019s chances of dying from prostate cancer, Marcella said.\n\nStatins may protect against fatal prostate cancer through their known cholesterol-lowering effects, said Dr. Stephen Freedland, who studies prostate cancer at the Duke University Medical Center in Durham, but wasn\u2019t involved in the new study.\n\nHe said that cholesterol is a \u201ckey nutrient\u201d for cancer cells, so lower cholesterol levels in the body could prevent more aggressive forms of cancer from developing.\n\nBut it\u2019s also possible that statins don\u2019t prevent certain cancers at all, Freedland said, and it\u2019s something else about men who take statins \u2014 for example, if they also change their diet and start exercising \u2014 that explains their lower risk of fatal cancer.\n\n\u201cIt gets very, very tricky to sort out,\u201d Freedland told Reuters Health.\n\nTo prove that statins protect against aggressive cancer would require a large study in which cancer-free men, or those with early-stage disease, are randomly assigned to take statins or not and then tracked for years to see how many of them die from cancer.\n\nThat type of study, especially involving healthy, disease-free men, would be very expensive and time consuming, said Dr. Nelly Tan, from the University of California, Los Angeles, who has studied statins and prostate cancer risk.\n\nAbout one-quarter of adults age 45 and older in the U.S. take statins to lower cholesterol and protect against heart attacks. The drugs run anywhere from $11 to more than $200 per month, and sometimes cause side effects including muscle pain, nausea and gas and liver dysfunction.\n\nResearchers agreed that until there\u2019s clearer evidence for benefit, men with healthy hearts shouldn\u2019t seek out statin prescriptions for the purpose of lowering their prostate cancer risks.\n\nBut Freedland said that other strategies for lowering cholesterol \u2014 such as eating better and exercising regularly \u2014 are ways almost everyone can lower their disease risks in the meantime.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Good job briefly mentioning statin side effects of muscle pain, nausea, gas, and liver dysfunction.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "THURSDAY, Oct. 18, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- In what researchers are calling a \"breakthrough,\" two preliminary trials have found that either of two triple-drug regimens could potentially benefit 90 percent of people with cystic fibrosis.\n\nThe trials were short-term, finding that the drug combinations improved adult patients' lung function over four weeks. But experts said they were optimistic the results will hold up in the larger, longer-term trials already underway.\n\nWhat's most exciting, they said, is that the triple-drug approach could open up new options to nearly all cystic fibrosis patients.\n\n\"This is not a cure for cystic fibrosis,\" stressed Dr. Steven Rowe, who led one of the trials. \"But it could be game-changing.\"\n\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that causes persistent lung infections. Over time, extensive lung damage leads to respiratory failure. At one time, children with CF usually died before they reached school age. But with improved treatments, the typical life expectancy is now about 40 years, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.\n\nCystic fibrosis is caused by various mutations in a gene called CFTR. In the past several years, drugs that target those underlying genetics have become available. Known as CFTR modulators, they were heralded as a major advance in treating the disorder.\n\nHowever, they work well only for a small number of people with certain CFTR mutations, explained Rowe, director of the Cystic Fibrosis Research Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n\nThe most common mutation that causes cystic fibrosis is called F508del -- and it has proven tougher to tackle, Rowe said.\n\nAbout half of people with CF carry two copies of the mutation (one inherited from each parent). For them, a combination of two existing CFTR modulators can ease breathing problems -- but the overall effects are only \"modest,\" Rowe said.\n\nThen there's the 30 percent of CF patients who carry only one copy of F508del, plus another defect known as a \"minimal-function\" mutation. For them, the existing CFTR modulators do not work at all.\n\nBoth new trials focused on those two groups of patients. The results are published in the Oct. 18 New England Journal of Medicine, to coincide with the researchers' presentation at a North American Cystic Fibrosis meeting, in Denver.\n\nRowe's team tested a combination of two available CFTR modulators -- tezacaftor and ivacaftor -- plus an experimental one, known as VX-659. The other trial used the same existing drugs, along with a similar new drug, dubbed VX-445.\n\nRowe's team randomly assigned 54 adults with cystic fibrosis to either take the triple-drug regimen or be in a comparison group. In the comparison group, patients with one F508del mutation took placebo pills, while patients with two copies of the mutation took tezacaftor and ivacaftor alone.\n\nAfter four weeks, the trial found, the triple-drug therapy had improved lung function in patients with both types of mutations. Their performance on a test called FEV1 rose by as much as 13 percentage points, on average -- what Rowe described as a \"pronounced improvement.\"\n\nThe other trial had nearly identical results.\n\nThis is the first time, Rowe said, that CFTR modulator therapy has \"pushed the needle\" for patients with one F508del mutation.\n\nAn editorial published with the studies said they \"represent a major breakthrough.\"\n\nNow the questions are whether the improved lung function can be sustained, and whether the drugs prevent symptom exacerbations and other complications, wrote Dr. Fernando Holguin, of the University of Colorado, Aurora.\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing both experimental drugs.\n\n\"The ability of these potential drugs to treat individuals with a single F508del mutation means that more people than ever before could benefit,\" said Dr. Michael Boyle, senior vice president for therapeutics at the foundation. \"This is very exciting news for our community.\"\n\nRowe agreed there are still important questions about the triple-drug regimens.

But are they receiving it?\n\nWhen it comes to learning about the differences in risk among certain types of nicotine products, many government websites are actually misleading or under-informing the public, according to two researchers who analyzed the content of numerous health websites.\n\nThis \"information quarantine\" in turn helps explain the woeful lack of public knowledge about relative risks, violating basic consumer rights as well as the public health principles of individual rights and health literacy, the researchers say.\n\n\n\nWriting in the International Journal of Drug Policy, Lynn Kozlowski of the University at Buffalo and David Sweanor of the University of Ottawa point out that many websites omit information showing that products such as e-cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and snus are far less harmful than traditional cigarettes.\n\n\u201cPublic health ethics always has a concern to avoid any net harm to population health,\u201d explains Kozlowski, professor of community health and health behavior at UB and the paper\u2019s lead author.\n\n\u201cThe fear has been that much safer tobacco and nicotine products like snus, smokeless tobacco and vape will possibly cause a net loss to public health because more people will use these products and these products may lead to cigarette use. This fear, however, is not based on actual evidence and cannot be used to suppress or otherwise keep the public uninformed of what is clearly known about the lower risks of these products,\u201d adds Kozlowski, PhD, one of the world\u2019s leading researchers on smoking behavior.\n\nAn information quarantine functions similarly to a medical quarantine \u2013 think of your favorite zombie movie or television show in which the infected person is secluded from everyone else to protect the overall public. In order to justify a quarantine, there has to be clear evidence that the need to protect population health should overrule personal autonomy.\n\nIn the case of providing information on differential health risks of nicotine products, \u201cThe evidence to date does not come close to establishing that there would be a loss to public health from making this information widely available from credible sources,\u201d Kozlowski says.\n\nKozlowski and Sweanor reviewed several major health websites \u2014 including the CDC, Mayo Clinic, American Cancer Society, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the National Cancer Institute \u2014 and found three types of examples of information on smokeless tobacco, \u201cbut no-to-modest efforts to inform consumers of the significantly lower risks compared to cigarettes for lifelong users,\u201d the researchers write.\n\nIn fact, they found that the Mayo Clinic perpetuated a misrepresentation discovered in 2003 \u2014 erroneously informing visitors that smokeless tobacco was as dangerous as cigarettes. The day after the article was released, the Mayo Clinic removed the headline, replacing it with the still misleading statement that smokeless tobacco was \u201cnot a safe product.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople can only make as good a decision as the information available to them allows,\u201d said Sweanor, an adjunct professor in the University of Ottawa\u2019s Faculty of Law who has spearheaded the development of world-leading tobacco control initiatives in Canada since the early 1980s.\n\n\u201cThe public is dramatically misinformed about the relative risks of substitutable tobacco and nicotine products. The risk differentials are huge, but this is simply not known by a vast majority of those whose lives are at risk,\u201d adds Sweanor.\n\nEngland has an example of a website \u2014 Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) \u2014 that gets it right on vaping, the researchers said. A briefing posted on the site specifically states: \u201cCompared to tobacco products, electronic cigarettes are significantly safer.\u201d\n\nIn their paper, the researchers note that information on comparative risks is common for other products and activities, like over-the-counter medicines and even safety ratings of vehicles.\n\nThey argue that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates the sale of tobacco products, isn\u2019t doing its part to inform consumers of important differences in harm among tobacco products.\n\nTo illustrate their point, Kozlowski and Sweanor use the example that if one type of alcoholic beverage caused 3 in 5 regular users to die prematurely \u2014 as is the case with smoking traditional cigarettes \u2014 while another caused massively fewer deaths, consumers would want to know which product was the safer alternative.\n\n\u201cIt would be scandalous, even criminal, to keep such facts from consumers,\u201d the researchers write. \u201cYet, such facts are being kept from adult consumers of legal tobacco/nicotine products, either by not informing or actively misinforming consumers.

All of these hormones are believed to play a role in brain health, and decreasing levels of these hormones are suspected to play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn a previous study, Baker and her colleagues demonstrated that treatment with GHRH provided a short-term boost in memory and concentration for healthy adults. In the current study, they wanted to see if GHRH could help restore some function in people who were showing signs of a condition known as mild cognitive impairment. People with this condition don't yet have Alzheimer's disease, but they do have problems with memory and focus, and they're at higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, according to the Alzheimer's Foundation.\n\nIn all, 137 adults, including 61 with mild cognitive impairment, completed the current study. The study volunteers were between 55 and 87 years old, with an average age of 68, according to the study.\n\nThe study participants were randomly assigned to receive a daily self-administered injection of growth hormone-releasing hormone or a placebo injection for 20 weeks. The study medications were supplied by the manufacturer of the growth hormone-releasing hormone.\n\nStudy funding was provided by grants from the U.S. National Institute on Aging and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nTests to measure mental prowess were given at the start of the study, and at 10, 20 and 30 weeks after treatment began.\n\nBaker said the researchers saw benefits in healthy adults and those with mild cognitive impairment who received GHRH. They saw improvement in \"planning, organizing, focusing and shifting from one task to another\" -- tasks collectively known as executive function. Baker said the researchers also saw a mild improvement in verbal memory in those treated with GHRH, but the results weren't as strong as for the executive function tasks.\n\nTreatment with GHRH boosted levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) by 117 percent, according to the study. \"IGF1 is a hormone we all have from birth that increases through development until it starts to decline in our early 50s. It promotes all kinds of growth in the body and brain, but if you have excess IGF1, it may put you at risk for cancer,\" said Baker, who added that people with Alzheimer's disease tend to have low levels of IGF1.\n\nBenefits from the treatment lasted as long as people stayed on the treatment. When treatment was stopped, the benefits gradually tapered off, Baker said.\n\nInsulin levels also spiked during treatment with GHRH, but only in the group already having memory problems. Baker said it wasn't clear why this happened, but she suspects the body may be trying to compensate for an insulin shortage in the brain in people with memory problems. Insulin helps glucose (sugar) enter cells to provide fuel for those cells.\n\nDr. Joel Zonszein, an endocrinologist from Montefiore Medical Center, in New York City, praised the study but said some questions still remain.\n\n\"This was an impressive study showing how GHRH can have a positive effect on cognitive function,\" Zonszein said. \"The question is, how can we use this in normal individuals? When GHRH goes down with aging, it's a physiological adaptation. And, we don't know what would happen if we gave it chronically.\"\n\nFor instance, \"would you alter the feedback mechanism that keeps IGF1 levels from increasing cancer risk? Would it start to lose some of its effect long term?\" he said.\n\n\"There may be both good and bad effects,\" Zonszein added.\n\nThe researchers said larger and longer trials are needed to assess the hormone's therapeutic potential.\n\nLearn more about mild cognitive impairment from the Alzheimer's Foundation.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story mentioned spiked insulin levels.\u00a0 But it didn\u2019t mention any of the side effects reported in the study:\n\u201cAdverse events primarily consisted of local skin reactions (redness, itching, or stinging) and increased arthralgias.

Patients who failed to achieve a cutoff score were excluded. The remaining subjects were divided randomly into four groups. In the operating room, deep anesthesia typical of major surgical procedures was induced in the first and third groups, and more superficial anesthesia in the second and fourth. Only the third and fourth groups received dexamethasone.\n\nThe depth of anesthesia was monitored using bispectral index (BIS) technology, which processes electroencephalogram signals to measure drug-induced unconsciousness. The researchers classified a BIS of 35-45 as deep anesthesia and a BIS of 46-55 as superficial anesthesia.\n\nIn the fourth group (superficial anesthesia with dexamethasone), the incidence of POCD was 15.3% immediately after surgery, but after six months the pre-operative cognitive status was restored in all patients.\n\n\"The results reinforce recent evidence of the importance of avoiding deep anesthesia,\" Carmona said. \"With regard to the use of dexamethasone, more research is needed to confirm our finding, preferably in multicenter trials, but there are strong indications that it can be beneficial in many cases.\"\n\nThe earliest trials with patients who developed POCD were performed after the 1950s.

This happens in about 9% of all deliveries and it can be seriously risky for the infant ; they can have all kinds of complications, including lung problems, brain hemorrhages, and infections.\n\nThe scientists analyzed 20,000 genes to find the ones that were active during pregnancy and labor.\n\nThey identified seven cfRNAs that seemed to be associated with premature birth, and in a test of 38 women, they found that they could predict premature birth up to two months in advance.\n\nAll the women were at risk for premature labor because they had early contractions or a previous preterm delivery, and 13 did indeed go on to have a premature baby.\n\nIn a subgroup of women, the test accurately classified 4 of 5 preterm deliveries as being at-risk, and incorrectly suggested that 3 of 18 women who had a full-term pregnancy were at risk for early labor.\n\nIn a test of 31 healthy pregnant women, testing for nine cfRNAs seemed roughly as accurate as an ultrasound at measuring gestational age. An ultrasound has a 48% accuracy rate at predicting a due date that's within two weeks of a baby's actual birth, while the blood test was 45% accurate. The test, if it does turn out to work in clinical trials, would be cheaper than ultrasound, said Quake.\n\n\"It might be tens or hundreds of dollars, rather than thousands,\" he said.\n\nThere's a lot more work to be done before these tests becomes available, including clinical trials. The studies were small and included only black or white women, but not other ethnicities. But the findings are promising, particularly because premature delivery is such a serious problem.\n\n\"Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal death, it\u2019s a huge problem,\" Quake said. If doctors know someone is at risk for premature labor earlier in pregnancy, they might start efforts to help delay labor, such as recommending bed rest.\n\nQuake became interested in the problem in part because his first child was born almost a month premature. She's now a healthy 16-year-old. \"You realize, holy cow, that was a pretty risky thing that we had no control over and no sense that it was coming,\" he said.\n\n\"We\u2019d like to see a bunch of lives saved, that\u2019s really the goal here,\" Quake said. \"There\u2019s a lot of work left to do before we get to that point, but we are pretty energized and excited at this point.\"\n\nThe study was funded by the March of Dimes and other nonprofit sources, although Quake and his colleagues have filed for a patent on the test.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Readers don\u2019t get a sense of what harms a false-positive test might expose a mother and her child too, and the rate here (nearly 17%) is rather high.

Keeping skin healthy in the bright light of day is hard work. The devotion to hats and rash guards, the careful selection of sunscreen and thorough application and reapplication every 90 minutes is at best tedious, and when children are involved, the process can be truly demoralizing. But once the towels are hung on the line, in the soft light of dusk, your work is done. Right?\n\nA new school of thought in the beauty world is pushing the idea that what you put on your skin after a day at the beach could play a part in reducing sun damage. One proponent of the concept is Hillary Peterson, founder of Bay Area-based company True Nature Botanicals. Ms. Peterson, a former marketing executive, began to explore the use of all-natural products several years ago after surviving melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer.\n\nHer take on sun exposure is refreshingly pragmatic. \u201cThe message with\u2026protection has been to stay out of [the sun],\u201d said Ms. Peterson. \u201cBut I\u2019m on the phone with you from Hawaii and can see at least 40 people on the beach, soaking in the rays. My kids are outside playing. I know that it\u2019s not realistic to say \u2018no sun.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe is, however, quite knowledgeable about how to be safe when you\u2019re in the sun. (She\u2019s also called on Terrence Collins, the Teresa Heinz Professor of Green Chemistry at Carnegie Mellon University as a consultant to formulate her line.) Ms. Peterson has long been aware of the role that antioxidants play in protecting skin from UV damage. (A groundbreaking study in 1996 proved antioxidants like vitamins C and E can boost the efficacy of sunscreen and make skin more resistant to damage.) She even brews antioxidant-rich green tea, lets it cool and puts it in a spray bottle. \u201cI spritz my kids with it before I apply sunscreen and again after they come out of the sun,\u201d she said.\n\nNow, a new study by Yale University cancer researchers, published this year, shows that the cell-damaging effects of ultra-violet rays may continue for some time after you seek cover. Ergo, it may be necessary to draw out the day\u2019s protective ministrations into nighttime.\n\nThis information is in the early stages of transforming the category of after-sun care\u2014a category traditionally limited to aloe vera-laden moisturizers and gels that lowered the temperature of sun-parched skin but not much else. Product formulators are now seeing after-sun care as another line of defense to stop cell mutations and aging in its tracks.\n\nMs. Peterson recommends her Pacific Mist spray which contains antioxidant-rich green tea and white tea extracts as well as sea fennel extract, which aids in hydration, and the line\u2019s Pacific Face Oil which contains a mix of oils from chia seed, kiwi, passion fruit and papaya seed\u2014all rich in essential fatty acids and antioxidants.\n\nWhen shopping for other after-sun treatments, be aware that some labels only add a trace, ineffective amount of a beneficial ingredient to a product in order to tout its effects on the label, while others have a bona fide antioxidant slant.\n\nOne Love Organics, a 6-year-old company founded by ex-lawyer Suzanne LeRoux, is a fine example of the latter. Based in St. Simons Island, Ga., the brand has an Eco-Cert-certified lab that creates mostly organic, botanical-based face and body treatments developed with sun exposure in mind. Ms. LeRoux typically recommends layering the brand\u2019s Vitamin C Body Oil or the Gardenia + Tea Antioxidant Body Serum under sunscreen during the day. Rich with botanical oils and green tea extract, both are also ideal after-sun products. \u201cOur lab is on an island in the South. We think about sun exposure a lot,\u201d she added.\n\nAfter-sun care converts should also look for products dispensed in a pump or spray which keeps contents from oxidizing when exposed to air, like Blissoma\u2019s pomegranate extract-filled Amend Antioxidant Sprayable Lotion. Avoid products formulated with alcohol, which can dry skin out.\n\nNot everyone is convinced of the effectiveness of after-sun care. Beverly Hills-based dermatologist Rhonda Rand believes most products can only lower skin temperature and add moisture. \u201cThat can make sun-exposed skin feel better,\u201d she said, \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing you can do to reverse sun exposure.\u201d And while Henry Lim, president of the American Academy of Dermatology, believes that the Yale study was important, he cautions that you only have a three-hour window after sun exposure to take advantage of any potential product benefits\u2014and that antioxidants \u201care notoriously not very stable and must be formulated carefully in order to be effective.\u201d\n\nBut believers like True Nature Botanicals\u2019 Ms. Peterson are undeterred. \u201cIn medicine, you need a definitive study,\u201d she countered. \u201cWe can\u2019t get doctors to say if you eat a healthier diet, your body will function better.

Higher soy intake was also associated with less reported fatigue. The breast cancer survivors studied included 173 non-Hispanic white and 192 Chinese Americans including US-born Chinese and Chinese immigrants.\n\nResearchers say breast cancer survivors often experience side effects from cancer treatments that can persist months or years after completion of treatment. For example, because many treatments designed to prevent breast cancer recurrence inhibit the body's production or use of estrogen, the hormone that can fuel breast cancer growth, breast cancer patients often experience hot flashes and night sweats, among other side effects.\n\nThe lead author on the study, Sarah Oppeneer Nomura, PhD, of Georgetown Lombardi, said that while further research is needed in larger study populations and with more detailed dietary data, this project addresses an important gap in research on the possible role of lifestyle factors, such as dietary habits, in relation to side effects of treatments.\n\n\"These symptoms can adversely impact survivors' quality of life and can lead them to stopping ongoing treatments, she says. \"Understanding the role of life style factors is important because diet can serve as a modifiable target for possibly reducing symptoms among breast cancer survivors.\"\n\nWhen study participants were evaluated separately by race/ethnicity, associations were significant among white breast cancer survivors; however; while a trend was seen in the benefit for Chinese women, results were not statically significant. Researchers explain Chinese women typically report fewer menopausal symptoms. Most of them also consume cruciferous vegetables and soy foods, making it difficult to see a significant effect in this subgroup. Indeed, in this study, Chinese breast cancer survivors ate more than twice as much soy and cruciferous vegetables.\n\nWhether the reduction in symptoms accounts for longtime use of soy and cruciferous vegetables needs further investigation, says the study's senior author, Judy Huei-yu Wang, PhD, of Georgetown Lombardi's Cancer Prevention and Control Program.\n\nResults obtained in preclinical studies in animals show that biologically active compounds present in both soy and cruciferous vegetables cause breast cancer cells to grow, but have opposite effects in animals that consume these compounds well before cancer is diagnosed and continue consuming them during and after cancer treatments.\n\nUntil more research is conducted, breast cancer patients should not suddenly start eating soy, if they have not consumed it before, says Leena Hilakivi-Clarke, PhD, a professor of oncology at Georgetown Lombardi and a co-author of the study.\n\nResearchers also found suggestive associations with lower reporting of other symptoms, including joint problems, hair thinning/loss and memory less in women who consumed more soy foods, but these associations did not reach statistical significance.\n\nPhytochemicals, or bioactive food components, such as isoflavones in soy foods and glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables may be the source of the benefit, researchers say. Isoflavones bind to estrogen receptors and exert weak estrogenic effects, among other effects. Glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables influence levels of metabolizing enzymes that can modulate inflammation and levels of estrogen, possibly attenuating treatment-related symptoms.\n\nCo-authors of the study include Chiranjeev Dash, MBBS, MPH, PhD, Leena Hilakivi-Clarke, PhD, and Yun-Ling Zhen, MPH, PhD, from Georgetown Lombardi; Yi-Tin Hwang, PhD, from National Taipei University, Taiwan; Scarlett Lin Gomez, MPH, PhD, from the Cancer Prevention Institute of California; Teresa T.

Using both together resulted in a 51 percent response, compared with a 30 percent response in women given Herceptin alone. Those given Tykerb alone had a 25 percent response.\n\n\"What we observed was a massive improvement in response,\" Baselga said.\n\nGlaxoSmithKline, the maker of Tykerb, helped fund the study.\n\n\"Lapatinib was approved for advanced breast cancer in 2007,\" Baselga said. \"The question we had was, what is the efficacy if we give it in early-stage breast cancer prior to surgery?\"\n\nBaselga and his colleagues conducted a trial treating 455 women from 23 countries. All had HER2-positive breast cancers. All had tumors larger than about three-fourths of an inch.\n\nIn HER2-positive breast cancer, test results are positive for a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, which promotes cancer cell growth.\n\nIn the study, 154 women got Tykerb, 149 Herceptin and the other 152 both drugs. All had the drug regimen before surgery, with Taxol (paclitaxel), a standard chemotherapy, added after six weeks. After 12 more weeks of treatment, the women had surgery.\n\nAt that point, researchers evaluated who had better responses. The women continued the treatments for one more year, allowing researchers to follow them and see how the approaches affected survival.\n\nBaselga stressed that the study looked only at women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancers, and that the drug Tykerb is approved now only for advanced breast cancers.\n\nThe study is well done and important, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society. The two drugs, he said, \"affect the same pathway but do it in a different way.\"\n\nWhile the combination showed a better response rate, \"there is also an increased level of side effects,\" he noted.\n\nWhile no major heart problems occurred, those on Tykerb alone or the two-drug combination had more diarrhea. Liver-enzyme alterations were also more frequent when Tykerb was used.\n\nGlaxoSmithKline notes that liver toxicity with the drug may be severe and that deaths have been reported, although the cause of the deaths has not been determined.\n\nThe important question, however, has not been answered yet, Lichtenfeld said. That's the effect on overall survival in using the two-drug approach. The researchers are continuing to evaluate that.\n\nCost is another consideration: Tykerb runs about $4,000 a month wholesale, and retail prices could be higher.\n\nIn another study, published online Jan. 17 in The Lancet Oncology, researchers from Germany reported that Tykerb is less beneficial than Herceptin as a single-drug therapy.\n\nThey assigned 620 women with HER2-positive breast cancer to get standard chemotherapy plus Herceptin or Tykerb.\n\nThey looked to see which drug was better at eliminating invasive cancer in the breast and metastatic cells in the lymph nodes.

Most of them have no scientific basis, and you don\u2019t know what you are getting.\u201d\n\nGuarente was involved in several other efforts to develop antiaging medicines that did not pan out. He was a founder of Elixir Pharmaceuticals and then became involved with Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, which conducted research into the potential antiaging properties of a chemical found in red wine.\n\nWith Elysium, Guarente and his colleagues are entering an industry with a mixed reputation. At $25 billion annually and growing, vitamins and supplements are hugely popular among consumers. But the business has often been criticized by mainstream medicine for making ambitious claims about quick cures and miraculous health improvements that are not subjected to rigorous scientific scrutiny.\n\nIf Elysium Health were developing Basis as a drug, it would have to conduct clinical trials with humans to prove that it works, and the Food and Drug Administration would have to sign off on its scientific evidence before it could be sold as medicine.\n\nBut as a supplement, Basis and similar products only have to be shown to be safe for humans to take, with labels that are not misleading. With Basis, for example, there is no scientific evidence yet that the pill would produce the same beneficial effect in humans as in mice.\n\nIndeed, one scientist not involved with Elysium questions the company\u2019s marketing pitch, saying there is too little information to know what Basis can do.\n\n\u201cIt is not quite clear to me what they want to target with this pill,\u201d said Pere Puigserver, a biology professor at Harvard Medical School. \u201cWhat does it mean, to improve metabolic health? And what exactly is being repaired in the body? And is the outcome the same for everyone?\u201d\n\nPuigserver, who runs a cancer biology lab at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, noted that addressing health and aging through metabolism involves a complex web of pathways and mechanisms.\n\n\u201cWe need more information on how this works precisely in people before we can advise them to take anything,\u201d he said.\n\nGuarente pledged that Elysium Health would be unlike most other companies in the business: It is conducting studies of its pill in humans and will release the results.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we have analyzed the data, we will publish them on our website,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the venture capitalists backing Elysium Health acknowledged that skepticism is among the company\u2019s greater challenges.\n\n\u201cThis space is traditionally driven by marketing language,\u201d said Kal Vapuri, whose New York firm Trisiras Group is one of Elysium\u2019s initial funders. \u201cBut we will be data-driven and will communicate the complexities of science in simple ways.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story suggests that supplements such as\u00a0Basis \u201chave to be shown to be safe for humans to take\u201d prior to being sold, and the story does not mention any potential harms.

Chan School of Public Health.\n\nThe study will be published online February 1, 2016 in Pediatrics.\n\n\"Previous studies of fiber intake and breast cancer have almost all been non-significant, and none of them examined diet during adolescence or early adulthood, a period when breast cancer risk factors appear to be particularly important,\" said Maryam Farvid, visiting scientist at Harvard Chan School and lead author of the study. \"This work on the role of nutrition in early life and breast cancer incidence suggests one of the very few potentially modifiable risk factors for premenopausal breast cancer.\"\n\nThe researchers looked at a group of 90,534 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II, a large long-running investigation of factors that influence women's health. In 1991, the women--ages 27-44 at the time--filled out questionnaires about their food intake, and did so every four years after that. They also completed a questionnaire in 1998 about their diet during high school. The researchers analyzed the women's fiber intake while adjusting for a number of other factors, such as race, family history of breast cancer, body mass index, weight change over time, menstruation history, alcohol use, and other dietary factors.\n\nBreast cancer risk was 12%-19% lower among women who ate more dietary fiber in early adulthood, depending on how much more they ate. High intake of fiber during adolescence was also associated with 16% lower risk of overall breast cancer and 24% lower risk of breast cancer before menopause. Among all the women, there was a strong inverse association between fiber intake and breast cancer incidence. For each additional 10 grams of fiber intake daily--for example, about one apple and two slices of whole wheat bread, or about half a cup each of cooked kidney beans and cooked cauliflower or squash--during early adulthood, breast cancer risk dropped by 13%. The greatest apparent benefit came from fruit and vegetable fiber.\n\nThe authors speculated that eating more fiber-rich foods may lessen breast cancer risk partly by helping to reduce high estrogen levels in the blood, which are strongly linked with breast cancer development.\n\n\"From many other studies we know that breast tissue is particularly influenced by carcinogens and anticarcinogens during childhood and adolescence,\" said Walter Willett, Fredrick John Stare Professor of Epidemiology and Nutrition at Harvard Chan School and senior author of the study. \"We now have evidence that what we feed our children during this period of life is also an important factor in future cancer risk.\"\n\nOther Harvard Chan School researchers involved in the study included Heather Eliassen, associate professor in the Department of Epidemiology, and Xiaomei Liao, research scientist in the Departments of Epidemiology and Biostatistics.\n\nThe study was supported by National Institutes of Health grants R01 CA050385 and UM1 CA176726 and a grant from The Breast Cancer Research Foundation.

Eight months later, none of the tumors had come back.\n\nTumors shrank or stopped growing in the other nine patients, says study researcher Claudio Pusceddu, MD, a specialist in radiation and oncology at Oncological Hospital in Cagliari, Italy.\n\nDuring microwave ablation, radiologists place a thin microwave antenna directly into the tumor.

So it's routine for patients to take clot-preventing drugs for some time afterward.\n\nSome doctors choose powerful anti-clotting drugs like heparin (Lovenox) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto), but it hasn't been clear whether these expensive prescription drugs work any better than cheap, readily available aspirin.\n\n\"Aspirin alone may provide similar protection compared to anticoagulation treatments,\" says Brian R. Hallstrom, M.D., an orthopaedic surgeon and associate chair for quality and safety at the University of Michigan Department of Orthopaedic Surgery.\n\nHallstrom is the lead author of a new study published in JAMA Surgery that found few patients developed a blood clot after surgery, and those patients on aspirin fared just as well as those on anticoagulants.\n\nDuring the two-year study period from 2013 to 2015, aspirin use rose from 10 percent to 50 percent among the patients cared for by orthopaedic surgeons in the Michigan Arthroplasty Registry Collaborative Quality Initiative, a statewide effort to give patients the best possible recovery and outcomes after hip and knee replacements.\n\nSince then, the shift has become even more distinct: Aspirin prescribing has risen to 70 percent among Michigan surgeons, says Hallstrom, who is co-director of the initiative and a health services researcher at U-M's Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation.\n\nBased on the experience of 41,537 Michigan patients undergoing knee replacement, the study may further the debate about the routine use of aspirin for clot prevention.\n\nA recent Canadian study looked at the issue, but the analysis had a caveat: Each of the more than 3,400 clinical trial patients received rivaroxaban the first five days after surgery. After that, they continued with the drug or switched to aspirin.\n\nThe new U-M study suggests patients may be adequately protected if they take aspirin alone from day one.\n\n\"This study is truly a real-world experience of what happened in Michigan when the majority of surgeons switched to aspirin,\" Hallstrom says. \"The incidence of blood clots, pulmonary embolus and death did not increase despite this dramatic change in practice.\"\n\nOver the past decade, surgeons have turned away from powerful anticoagulants and toward aspirin used in addition to nondrug improvements such as compression devices for thwarting clots.\n\nThese days, most patients have a generally low risk of blood clots after knee replacement for a number of reasons. Those reasons include shorter surgical times, less invasive procedures and use of regional anesthesia that allows early mobilization after surgery, Hallstrom says. Some patients are even going home the same day.\n\n\"The most important way to prevent blood clots is getting moving,\" says Hallstrom, noting that people are at risk for blood clots when they sit or lie in one position for too long, such as on an airplane or a hospital bed.\n\nThe critical care specialists who make up the American College of Chest Physicians favor heparin to reduce the risk of blood clots, while the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guidelines state that no one drug is better than another for preventing clots.\n\nThe U-M study involved patients undergoing knee replacement surgery at any of the 29 Michigan hospitals in the surgical quality group. One-third of the patients took aspirin alone; 54 percent took only an anticoagulant; and 13 percent took an aspirin/anticoagulant combination.\n\nOver three months, just 1.16 percent of aspirin patients developed a serious blood clot. That was true for 1.42 percent of anticoagulant patients, according to the Michigan study. This was not statistically different.\n\nSo, neither drug appeared better than the other -- but aspirin has some obvious advantages.\n\n\"Aspirin is easy to take and much less expensive,\" Hallstrom says. \"Patients can get it over the counter for pennies, while the other anticoagulants require monitoring, injections, frequent dose adjustments and are extremely expensive.\"\n\nThe reported cost for a 30-day supply of rivaroxaban is approximately $379 to $450; heparin is estimated at $450 to $890. Although warfarin costs a few dollars for a 30-day supply, its cost approaches that of the other anticoagulants when doctor visits for monitoring are factored in, Hallstrom says.\n\nThe study suggests most patients can have just aspirin without increasing the risk for venous thromboembolism, but doctors need to consider factors such as a patient's history of clots, obesity and ability to mobilize after surgery when determining the best measure for clot prevention, Hallstrom adds.", "question": "Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "\u201cGood old aspirin\u201d implies that aspirin is benign and without potential harms, which is not accurate, even if the harms of aspirin are typically less than those of anticoagulants.

Now, a groundbreaking study suggests that not all C-sections are equally risky.\n\nThe research looked at all full-term, firstborn births in Scotland over a 15-year period and tracked the babies\u2019 long-term health. It is one of the largest and longest studies to explore how planned C-sections differ from other deliveries.\n\nSurprisingly, the data showed more health problems among babies born by planned C-section than among those delivered by emergency C-section or vaginal birth, even though the planned surgery is done under more controlled conditions. The finding suggests that the arduous experience of labor \u2014 that exhausting, sweaty, utterly unpredictable yet often strangely exhilarating process \u2014 may give children a healthy start, even when it\u2019s interrupted by a surgical birth.\n\nThe new findings, published in JAMA this month, are important because the number of babies born by C-section has increased tremendously. In the United States, nearly one in three babies are born by C-section. Cesarean births that had no medical indication increased, to 5.5 percent of low-risk women in 2001, up from 3.3 percent of such women in 1991.\n\nDr. Mairead Black, the University of Aberdeen obstetrician who led the study, said that as cesarean births had increased in Scotland and worldwide, the researchers wondered what, if anything, children born by C-section \u201care missing out on.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur thinking was: If a baby is born naturally, it comes into contact with bacteria from the mother, which might help with immune system development,\u201d Dr. Black said.\n\nEven attempted labor may provide some exposure to bacteria, she said. But babies delivered by a planned C-section, which is usually scheduled to take place well before the first pang of labor, may miss out entirely.\n\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t wait for labor to begin on its own, you cut short all kinds of physiological changes and preparations for birth that are taking place toward the end of pregnancy,\u201d said Carol Sakala, the director of the nonprofit Childbirth Connection programs at the National Partnership for Women & Families. \u201cWhat is the effect of cutting off those processes so casually on such a large scale?\u201d\n\nStudies have consistently found that children born by C-section are at higher risk for health problems like obesity and allergies. C-section birth has also been associated with a higher risk for Type 1 diabetes.\n\nThe Scottish study took advantage of the small country\u2019s rich trove of linked birth and medical databases to track the long-term health of 321,287 babies. Nearly 4 percent were born by planned C-section and 17 percent were delivered by emergency surgery. The remaining 252,917 were vaginal births.\n\nThe researchers compared a range of health outcomes among the babies, including asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, Type 1 diabetes, early death and cancer.\n\nOver all, the differences between a scheduled C-section and an emergency C-section were slight. However, the data do begin to shed light on why babies born through vaginal birth may have fewer health risks than babies born by C-section.\n\nThe biggest difference between babies born by scheduled and unscheduled C-section appeared in risk for Type 1 diabetes. The results showed that babies born by planned C-section had a 35 percent higher risk of Type 1 diabetes compared with babies born by emergency C-section, after adjusting for differences among the mothers.\n\nAll of the babies born by C-section were slightly more likely to use an asthma inhaler at age 5: 10.3 percent of planned C-section babies and 10.19 percent of unscheduled C-section babies wound up using an inhaler, compared with 9.6 percent of vaginally born babies. Asthma hospitalization rates were also higher for babies born by planned C-section with a statistically significant increase of 22 percent over vaginally born babies.\n\nAlthough all of the C-section babies were more likely to be obese at age 5, the differences were not statistically significant after adjusting for differences among the mothers. There were no significant differences in cancer and irritable bowel disease among any of the types of births.\n\nNo one knows exactly why labor may be protective, but the spontaneous onset of labor prompts fluid to clear from a baby\u2019s lungs, said Dr. Aaron Caughey, who helped draw up 2014 guidelines for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that urged providers to let women spend more time in labor and avoid an unnecessary C-section.\n\nThe step is just one of a cascade of physiological changes that take place in mother and baby during the labor process, including surges in stress hormones and reproductive hormones like oxytocin that may help the fetus adapt during labor, preserve blood flow to the organs, and keep the baby alert and prepared for breast-feeding.\n\nDuring labor, a newborn absorbs maternal microbes into its mouth and gastrointestinal tract, said Dr. Josef Neu, a neonatologist at the University of Florida who has written about C-section babies and the hygiene hypothesis.\n\nThe theory is that maternal microbes \u201ctrain\u201d the infant\u2019s immune system, so it doesn\u2019t overreact or become destructive and precipitate autoimmune disorders like Type 1 diabetes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an education process that says, \u2018Calm down, you\u2019re going to be seeing this antigen again, you don\u2019t have to be so aggressive,\u2019\u201d Dr. Neu said.\n\nDr. Neu said the broad-spectrum antibiotics prescribed to the mother before a surgical delivery were another concern; the antibiotics can be transmitted to the baby through breast milk if not before birth, decreasing the diversity of natural bacteria.\n\nThe findings are a reminder that although C-sections are appropriate in some circumstances, they are a poor substitute for labor.\n\nChildbirth and labor are \u201ca physiological process that we\u2019ve evolved to over millions of years,\u201d Dr. Caughey said. \u201cIt\u2019s been really well-designed by evolution.\u201d\n\u2022 Does Frequent Sex Prime the Immune System for Pregnancy?\n\n\n\n For more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story is a comparison of harms and it did a reasonable job of describing relatively slight differences between the study groups: planned C-sections, unplanned C-sections and vaginal deliveries.\nThe headline overstates what the story describes carefully.

Their findings were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology by Robert McBane II M.D., a Mayo Clinic cardiologist.\n\n\"Nearly 1 in 5 patients with cancer will develop a clot in the veins, referred to as either a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism,\" says Dr. McBane. \"Clotting events can be deadly with pulmonary embolism being the second most common cause of death in cancer patients.\"\n\nWhile twice-daily injections of low-molecular-weight heparin has been the traditional treatment of choice for cancer patients who suffer a venous clot, Dr. McBane notes that there are numerous limitations to this therapy. \"These injections can be painful and cause considerable bruising at the injection site. Injections are expensive at nearly $100 per day. And cancer patients may experience low platelet counts and be at risk for a clotting disorder called 'heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.'\" Dr. McBane noted that cancer and cancer treatment can be associated with kidney injury, which can limit the drug's use further. Finally, Dr. McBane says there isn't is a good antidote for this medication should a bleeding problem arise.\n\n\"More recently, a number of new blood thinners called 'direct oral anticoagulants' have become available,\" says Dr. McBane. \"As a class, these drugs have a number of advantages, including oral delivery, lack of interactions with foods or other medications, and the lack of a need for monitoring drug levels.\" He says these qualities make this class of drug much easier to use than the traditional blood thinners. However, it was unclear whether these drugs could be used safely in cancer patients until now.\n\nDr. McBane says quality of life surveys, which were taken monthly throughout the six-month trial, showed that patients markedly preferred oral apixaban over injectable dalteparin. \"We are hopeful that this medication will also improve medication compliance in cancer patients requiring blood thinner therapy.\"\n\nAs a leading institution funded by the National Cancer Institute, Mayo Clinic Cancer Center conducts basic, clinical and population science research, translating discoveries into improved methods for prevention, diagnosis, prognosis and therapy.

The release talks about the limitations of the comparator but not apixaban. It certainly seems that there are fewer side effects from apixaban than heparin, particularly because there are no injection-related issues (such as bruising, pain and swelling) from the oral medication. Yet this does not mean that apixaban is completely harmless; like other anti-coagulant medications, one of the side effects is major bleeding which can quickly become dangerous if not treated. \nIn this study, patients receiving apixaban had fewer subsequent blood clots and didn\u2019t appear to have higher rates of bleeding \u2014 the main complication of any blood thinner. Several caveats should be mentioned: first, this was a relatively small trial and included a range of different cancers. Follow-up studies are needed to confirm these results in more patients across a range of different cancers. Second, though it wasn\u2019t statistically significant, more patients in the apixaban group had died at 6 months (15.9% vs. 10.6%).

Newly published research in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition showed that a hearty bowl of instant oatmeal helped curb food intake at lunch better than a leading oat-based, cold cereal -- even when each bowl provided the same number of calories.\n\nThe statistically significant results of the randomized, controlled crossover study (n=47) showed that a 250-calorie instant oatmeal serving (with an additional 113 calories of skim milk) enhanced satiety and feelings of fullness, reduced the desire to eat and may even lead to a lower caloric intake at lunch, compared to a 250-calorie serving of cold, oat-based cereal, also served with an additional 113 calories of skim milk.\n\n\"The satiety benefits of instant oatmeal alone were important findings,\" remarked lead author Candida Rebello, MS, RD, of Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University. \"When we took it a step further and evaluated the intake four hours post-breakfast, we found that after consuming instant oatmeal, the participants chose to eat significantly less at lunch compared to those who ate the oat-based, cold cereal.\"\n\nAfter an analysis of the types of fiber in each cereal, the researchers suspected that the higher molecular viscosity of the beta-glucan in the instant oatmeal contributed to its satiating effect over the oat-based, cold cereal. Authors stated that the processing of the cold cereal might lead to changes in the oat fiber that reduced its ability to enhance satiety.\n\nResearchers presented the participants with a lunch meal of their choice - turkey, ham, roast beef or vegetable patty sandwiches and a calorie-free or calorie-containing beverage, alongside potato crisps and cookies. The lunches offered ranged from 2,600 to 2,800 calories and participants were told to \"eat to satisfaction.\" Total calorie intake was significantly lower following consumption of instant oatmeal compared to the cold cereal, as were fat and protein intake.

If they are at high risk of heart disease, they're doing the right thing, according to draft recommendations issued Monday by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.\n\nThe independent panel also said that taking low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years may protect against colorectal cancer, at least in people who are already taking it to prevent heart attacks and stroke.\n\nAdults between the ages of 50 and 59 who have a 10 percent or greater risk of having a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years benefit the most from taking about 81 milligrams of aspirin every day, the panel says.\n\nBut the potential benefit is smaller for adults between the ages of 60 and 69. And it's unknown for adults under 50 or over 70. People should talk with their health care provider to find out if they have health problems that would justify taking aspirin, according to Dr. Douglas Owens, a professor of medicine at Stanford University and a member of the task force.\n\nFor example, uncontrolled high blood pressure, or high cholesterol, obesity, age and diabetes can all increase heart disease risk. \"Because heart attacks are caused by clots in the arteries of the heart, aspirin can help prevent heart attack and it can also help prevent strokes that are caused by blood clots,\" Owens says.\n\nSeveral groups including the American Heart Association offer online calculators to help people figure out their risk, which, along with discussion with a health care provider, can help determine whether daily aspirin might be useful.\n\nHowever, there is a caveat. Daily aspirin can cause bleeding in the stomach and brain. And Owens says that people with medical conditions like ulcers, kidney problems, liver problems or bleeding disorders are more vulnerable, as are people who take blood-thinning drugs and NSAIDs.\n\nThese new recommendations aren't final, and are open to public comment.\n\nConcerns have been raised about whether aspirin is really effective enough, when so many other medicines are available to help control heart disease risk.\n\nOne physician with major concerns is Steven Nissen, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, in Cleveland, Ohio. \"I think that millions of Americans are taking aspirin \u2014 some of them are really the 'worried well,' \" he says.\n\nIf people don't have a significantly increased risk of having a heart attack or stroke over the next decade, Nissen says, they may be \"causing more harm than benefit.\"\n\nAnd while many medical groups recommend daily aspirin to lower heart disease risk, not all federal agencies agree. The Food and Drug Administration actually issued a warning against routinely taking aspirin to prevent heart disease in people without significantly high risk.\n\nNissen worries that many people are mistaking their actual heart disease risk. \"With all the good therapies, better blood pressure control, better cholesterol control, all the things we do in modern medicine,\" he says, \"over the last couple of decades, we've had nearly a 50 percent reduction in the rate of cardiovascular disease.\"\n\nPeople who don't really need to should not be taking aspirin every day, says Nissen. \"It's just not prudent or safe,\" he says, noting that bleeding in the abdomen or brain is extremely dangerous and can be fatal.

(Vanda) (NASDAQ: VNDA) today announced that HETLIOZ\u00ae, a circadian regulator, demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful benefits in nighttime and daytime symptoms of jet lag disorder. HETLIOZ\u00ae is currently approved in the US and Europe for the treatment of Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder, a rare and chronic circadian rhythm sleep disorder.\n\nJet lag disorder is a common circadian disorder frequently observed in millions of travelers who cross multiple time zones. Jet lag disorder is characterized by nighttime sleep disruption, a decrease in daytime alertness and impairment to social and occupational functioning.\n\nThe clinical efficacy results reported today are from the JET8 Phase-III clinical study (3107) (the JET8 study). In the JET8 study, 318 healthy volunteers were admitted to a sleep unit and were subjected to a circadian challenge of an 8 hours advance to their usual bedtime. The JET8 study design induced the circadian challenge experienced by travelers who cross 8 times zones, which leads to jet lag disorder. This clinical design allowed for the study of HETLIOZ\u00ae without the confounding effects of sleep deprivation and variable light conditions.\n\nResults from the JET8 study showed significant and clinically meaningful effects of HETLIOZ\u00ae 20 mg on the primary endpoint of the study as well as multiple secondary endpoints. The pre-specified primary endpoint was the amount of sleep time in the first two thirds of the night. Secondary endpoints included measures of sleep parameters (TST, LPS, WASO) and next day alertness (KSS and VAS). (Table 1).\n\nThe results of the JET8 study shown above demonstrate the effectiveness of HETLIOZ\u00ae in treating jet lag disorder. The magnitude of the total sleep time benefit of 85 minutes improvement over placebo is significant and clinically meaningful. The demonstration of benefits in measurements of next day alertness on both KSS and VAS is meaningful and it underscores the ability of HETLIOZ\u00ae to address both nighttime and daytime symptoms of jet lag disorder.\n\nVanda previously reported on the JET5 study (3101) that examined the effects of HETLIOZ\u00ae in a circadian challenge of 5 hours advance of the subjects' usual bedtime. The results of that study were published in The Lancet in 2009.1 The observation that HETLIOZ\u00ae is effective in treating the symptoms caused by an abrupt advance of the circadian cycle of a magnitude of 5 or 8 hours suggests that HETLIOZ\u00ae will be an effective therapeutic tool in the treatment of individuals that experience symptoms of jet lag. HETLIOZ\u00ae will be potentially useful under circumstances of rapid eastward transmeridian travel experienced by frequent travelers, the rapid deployment of military troops and any circumstances that will necessitate the abrupt phase advance of the sleep wake cycle.\n\nJet lag disorder affects millions of individuals annually who cross multiple time zones during their travel. Jet lag disorder symptoms are more severe during eastward travel. It is reported that more than 30 million US residents make trips abroad each year to overseas destinations. Of these, 60% (approximately 20 million) travel to destinations in Europe, Middle East and Asia. It is also reported that 8% (approximately 1.6 million) travel in Business or First class.2\n\n\"We are extremely pleased with the outcome of this study which establishes the utility of HETLIOZ\u00ae in the treatment of jet lag disorder as HETLIOZ\u00ae was shown to overcome a significant circadian challenge of an 8 hour phase advance. This challenge is equivalent to eastward travel across 8 time zones as experienced for example on travel from Los Angeles to London, Washington DC to Moscow, Paris to Tokyo, or London to Singapore. HETLIOZ\u00ae improved both nighttime sleep and next day alertness potentially offering significant benefits to millions of travelers,\" said Mihael H. Polymeropoulos, MD, Vanda's President and CEO.\n\nVanda intends to seek marketing approval for the use of HETLIOZ\u00ae in the treatment of jet lag disorder. Vanda believes that if HETLIOZ\u00ae is approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of jet lag disorder it will potentially offer a therapeutic solution to many travelers and will likely represent an important commercial opportunity for the company.

But now a study has found that light therapy also works in treating non-seasonal depression.\n\nThe research, published Wednesday in JAMA Psychiatry, is significant because major depression is one of the most common mental health disorders in the United States and one of the leading causes of disability worldwide.\n\nLight therapy is cheap, easy to use and comes with few side effects compared to medication such as antidepressants, said lead author Raymond Lam, a professor of psychiatry at the University of British Columbia.\n\nPrevious research on light therapy for non-seasonal depression has been limited. This study \"shows a new, proven-safe treatment of depression that is probably both more effective and less expensive than drug treatment or anything else,\" said Dan Kripke, a psychiatrist and professor emeritus at the University of California, San Diego, who has studied the topic but was not involved in the latest trial.\n\n[It's 3 a.m. and you're depressed. How technology is transforming mental health care.]\n\nThe researchers said enough clinical evidence now supports mental health professionals recommending light therapy as a treatment for depression. Most people typically receive medication and psychotherapy \u2014 but medications don't work in all cases and there's a shortage of providers in many areas.\n\n[Why it's so hard to find a mental health professional ]\n\nLam and his colleagues followed 122 patients and evaluated whether light therapy improved their mood when it was used both with and without fluoxetine, or Prozac, a commonly prescribed antidepressant. Over eight weeks, participants were exposed daily to 30 minutes from a fluorescent light box soon after waking up. Some participants were instead given placebo pills and placebo devices.\n\nAlthough the light therapy helped many patients, it provided the most benefit to those who were also taking the antidepressant. About 60 percent of those using light therapy with the antidepressant reported feeling almost back to normal, Lam said.\n\nResearchers have two main theories on why light therapy works. One is that it affects the biological clock in the brain. There's some evidence that depression, like jet lag, occurs when the biological clock is out of sync, and light helps to correct that, Lam said.\n\nLight is also believed to affect neurotransmitters in the brain. Those are considered important for the development of depression and are the targets of most antidepressant medications.\n\nWomen more likely to have serious mental health problems than men, study says\n\nNIH's mental health chief on why he's leaving for Google: Technology may hold key to better diagnosis\n\nMost Americans will get a wrong diagnosis at least once in their lives", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The short story does not mention potential harms of light therapy., and it doesn\u2019t say there are few or none known.

During the study, more than 26,000 of the 440,000 participants, all with atrial fibrillation, were diagnosed with dementia.\n\nAt the time they joined the study, about half of the participants were taking oral anticoagulants, such as warfarin, Eliquis (apixaban), Pradaxa (dabigatran), Savaysa (edoxaban) or Xarelto (rivaroxaban).\n\nThe researchers found that people taking anticoagulants were 29 percent less likely to develop dementia than were those who were not taking the blood thinners.\n\nWhen the researchers focused on people who continued to take the drugs, they found an even larger reduction (48 percent) in the risk for dementia. They also found that the sooner people started taking blood thinners after their diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, the lower their risk for dementia.\n\nAlong with not taking blood thinners, the strongest predictors for dementia were age, Parkinson's disease and alcohol abuse, according to the study, published Oct. 25 in the European Heart Journal.\n\nThe findings strongly suggest that blood thinners reduce the risk for dementia in people with atrial fibrillation, but proving that would not be possible, the Swedish researchers said.\n\n\"In order to prove this assumption, randomized placebo-controlled trials would be needed, but such studies cannot be done because of ethical reasons,\" researchers Leif Friberg and Marten Rosenqvist, of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, said in a journal news release. \"It is not possible to give placebo to [atrial fibrillation] patients and then wait for dementia or stroke to occur.\"\n\nHowever, the findings show that people with atrial fibrillation should start taking blood thinners as soon as possible after their diagnosis and continue to take the drugs, Friberg noted.\n\n\"Patients start on oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention but they stop after a few years at an alarmingly high rate,\" he said. \"In the first year, approximately 15 percent stop taking the drugs, then approximately 10 percent each year.\"\n\n\"If you know that [atrial fibrillation] eats away your brain at a slow but steady pace and that you can prevent it by staying on treatment, I think most patients would find this a very strong argument for continuing treatment,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has more on atrial fibrillation.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "People stop taking these drugs for a reason, and some of those reasons might have to do with the side effects or adverse effects which can also include unstoppable bleeding.

Men with high-risk cancer need long-term hormone therapy.\n\nThe hormone therapy is known as androgen deprivation therapy. It's designed to reduce the levels of male hormones (androgens) in the body, since they can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells.\n\n\"For patients with early, localized cancer of the prostate who were treated with radiation therapy, [by] adding short-term androgen deprivation therapy, we improved their cure rates and increased their chance of living 10 years from 57 percent to 62 percent,\" said lead researcher Dr. Christopher U. Jones, from Radiological Associates of Sacramento, Calif.\n\nBut when the researchers looked closely at those findings, they found that patients with low-risk prostate cancer did not need hormone therapy because the chance they would survive with radiation alone was already almost 99 percent, Jones said.\n\nAnd while short term hormonal therapy is \"not very toxic, there are [still] some toxicities,\" Jones noted. \"We don't want to treat any man unnecessarily with that type of treatment. We really want to make sure -- if we are going to recommend that treatment -- the person really needs it,\" he said.\n\nOn the other hand, hormone therapy plus radiation was most effective in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer. \"We decreased the risk of dying from prostate cancer in those patients from 10 percent to 3 percent, at 10 years,\" Jones said.\n\nFor patients with high-risk prostate cancer, using hormone therapy for just a short while is not effective, he added. \"We know from other studies that short-term androgen deprivation therapy isn't enough. You need to give long-term androgen deprivation therapy in addition to radiation to have the best results,\" Jones said.\n\nThe report was published in the July 14 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nFor the study, Jones' team randomly assigned almost 2,000 men with prostate cancer to radiation therapy alone or in combination with four months of hormone therapy. The hormone therapy started two months before radiation.\n\nSide effects of male hormone therapy can include erectile dysfunction (impotence), loss of sex drive, hot flashes, growth of breast tissue, loss of muscle and bone mass, weight gain, nausea, liver problems, fatigue, memory problems and mood swings.\n\nIn October 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration asked manufacturers to add a warning that certain drugs used in hormone therapy (including the one used in the study) were linked to a small but increased risk of diabetes, heart attack, stroke and sudden death in men.\n\nIn this study, men treated with hormone therapy experienced a much higher percentage of liver damage; toxic effects of radiation treatment were similar in both groups.\n\nOver an average of over nine years of follow-up, 62 percent of the men who had combination therapy were alive, compared with 57 percent of the men who received radiation therapy alone, the researchers found.\n\nOverall, hormone therapy reduced the risk of dying from prostate cancer over 10 years from 8 percent to 4 percent, Jones said.\n\nHe noted that the radiation treatments in use today differ from those given in 1994 when the trial began.\n\n\"We can give 15 to 20 percent higher doses of radiation now than we could then, and we can do it more safely and more accurately,\" he said. So, that brings into question how much, if any, hormone therapy is needed, he added.\n\nAn ongoing trial among patients with intermediate risk prostate cancer aims to answer that question, Jones said. \"We are going to find out if androgen deprivation therapy still applies to patients treated with modern techniques,\" he said.\n\n\"This study, in conjunction with what we know about hormonal therapy, really nails home the conclusion that hormonal therapy should not be used in men with low-risk disease because the risks outweigh any conceivable benefit,\" commented Dr. Anthony D'Amico, chief of radiation oncology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and author of an accompanying journal editorial.\n\nD'Amico noted that new studies using up-to-date high-dose radiation also found that the addition of short-term hormone therapy improved outcomes at five years for men with intermediate risk prostate cancer, compared with radiation alone.\n\n\"If you are in the low-risk category, stay away from hormone therapy. It does no good. [It] can hurt,\" D'Amico said. \"If you have anything beyond low-risk [prostate cancer], the hormonal therapy helps,\" he said. \"It's just a matter of how long you need it for. It could be four months, six months or longer.\"\n\nThese findings are good news for some men, since the effects of short term of hormone therapy are reversible, D'Amico said. \"It's not three years, where men are changed forever,\" he said.\n\nFor more information on prostate cancer, visit the American Cancer Society.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The harms associated with male hormone therapy were listed.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Outside of heart attacks, doctors are often too quick to use a common $20,000 procedure to treat patients suffering from coronary artery disease, a new study suggests.\n\nAbout 600,000 angioplasty procedures, which almost always involve placement of a tiny metal tube called a stent, are done in the U.S. each year.

In recent years, the FDA has approved six drugs for men with metastatic disease, all of which can increase survival. In a study published in Urology\u00ae, researchers demonstrate for the first time that an aggressive combination of systemic therapy (drug treatment) with local therapy (surgery and radiation) directed at both the primary tumor and metastasis can eliminate all detectable disease in selected patients with metastatic prostate cancer.\n\nWhile the study is only a first step, one-fifth of the patients treated had no detectable disease, with an undetectable prostate-specific-androgen (PSA) and normal blood testosterone, after 20 months. The results suggest that some men who have previously been considered incurable can possibly be cured; investigators also establish a new paradigm for testing various drug combinations in conjunction with local treatment of the prostate to determine which is the best approach (ie, has the highest undetectable disease rate). Such results could not have been achieved with any single therapy alone.\n\nAccording to lead investigator Howard I. Scher, MD, Chief of the Genitourinary Oncology Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, \"The sequential use of the three different modalities helped illustrate the role and importance of each in achieving the undetectable PSA with normal testosterone level end point, which represents a 'no-evidence of disease' status.\" Longer follow-up is needed to determine whether these patients were in fact cured.\n\nTwenty men with metastatic prostate cancer, five with extra-pelvic lymph nodal disease and 15 with bone with or without nodal disease, were treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), radical surgery that included a retroperitoneal lymph node dissection as needed, and radiation therapy to visible metastatic lesions in bone. ADT was stopped after a minimum of six months if an undetectable PSA was achieved after combined modality therapy. Other patients were treated continuously.\n\nThe combined treatment regimen including surgery was well tolerated. Matthew J. O'Shaughnessy, MD, PhD, Urology Service, Department of Surgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, commented \"While the role of local therapy in metastatic prostate cancer is still under investigation, aggressive resection of visible disease performed by experienced surgeons was critical to the outcome.\"\n\nOf the five patients with extra-pelvic lymph node involvement, four achieved an undetectable PSA after ADT and surgery, while the fifth needed radiation to reach this milestone. However, none achieved the primary end point of undetectable PSA with testosterone recovery at 20 months after initiation of therapy with ADT alone, although one patient had a PSA of Of the 15 patients with bone metastases, 14 (93%) reached an undetectable PSA when ADT, surgery, and radiation were used. Ultimately, four (27%) achieved the proposed end point, a PSA of 150 ng/dL at 20 months after the start of ADT, which remained undetectable in two patients for 27 and 46 months, respectively. Commenting on the study, Oliver Sartor, MD, Cancer Research, Department of Medicine and Urology, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, LA, stated, \"The end point deserves special mention, as the end point of undetectable PSA after testosterone recovery has been previously discussed but rarely studied. The authors proposed that this end point may serve as a first step toward establishing a curative paradigm. Many in the field agree, but note that the longevity of effect is essential to prove the point of curability. Regardless, the movement toward a curative paradigm is much needed and the investigators are to be congratulated for setting forth a paradigm that can be used to assess the possibility of cure in a reasonable period of time.\" \"A multimodal treatment strategy for patients who present with disease that is beyond the limits of curability by any single modality enables the evaluation of new approaches in order to prioritize large-scale testing in early stages of advanced disease. The end point also shifts the paradigm from palliation to cure,\" remarked Dr. Scher.

But the mechanisms underlying the effect were not well understood.\n\nResearchers in the lab of Jun Wu, research assistant professor at the LSI, wanted to better understand cinnamaldehyde's action and determine whether it might be protective in humans, too.\n\n\"Scientists were finding that this compound affected metabolism,\" said Wu, who also is an assistant professor of molecular and integrative physiology at the U-M Medical School. \"So we wanted to figure out how--what pathway might be involved, what it looked like in mice and what it looked like in human cells.\"\n\nTheir findings, which appear in the December issue of the journal Metabolism, indicated that cinnamaldehyde improves metabolic health by acting directly on fat cells, or adipocytes, inducing them to start burning energy through a process called thermogenesis.\n\nWu and her colleagues tested human adipocytes from volunteers representing a range of ages, ethnicities and body mass indices. When the cells were treated with cinnamaldehyde, the researchers noticed increased expression of several genes and enzymes that enhance lipid metabolism. They also observed an increase in Ucp1 and Fgf21, which are important metabolic regulatory proteins involved in thermogenesis.\n\nAdipocytes normally store energy in the form of lipids. This long-term storage was beneficial to our distant ancestors, who had much less access to high-fat foods and thus a much greater need to store fat. That fat could then be used by the body in times of scarcity or in cold temperatures, which induce adipocytes to convert stored energy into heat.\n\n\"It's only been relatively recently that energy surplus has become a problem,\" Wu said. \"Throughout evolution, the opposite--energy deficiency--has been the problem. So any energy-consuming process usually turns off the moment the body doesn't need it.\"\n\nWith the rising obesity epidemic, researchers like Wu have been looking for ways to prompt fat cells to activate thermogenesis, turning those fat-burning processes back on.\n\nWu believes that cinnamaldehyde may offer one such activation method. And because it is already used widely in the food industry, it might be easier to convince patients to stick to a cinnamon-based treatment than to a traditional drug regimen.\n\n\"Cinnamon has been part of our diets for thousands of years, and people generally enjoy it,\" Wu said. \"So if it can help protect against obesity, too, it may offer an approach to metabolic health that is easier for patients to adhere to.\"\n\nNow, before anyone goes dumping tons of extra cinnamon in their egg nog in hopes of keeping holiday-season pounds at bay, Wu cautioned that further study is needed to determine how best to harness cinnamaldehyde's metabolic benefits without causing adverse side effects.\n\nThe research was supported by the Human Frontier Science Program, Edward Mallinckrodt Jr. Foundation, National Institutes of Health and American Heart Association.\n\nOther study authors were: Juan Jiang, Margo Emont, Heejin Jun, Xiaona Qiao, Jiling Liao and Dong-il Kim, all of U-M.\n\nThe study is titled \"Cinnamaldehyde induces fat cell-autonomous thermogenesis and metabolic reprogramming,\" DOI: 10.1016/j.metabol.2017.08.006.", "question": "Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "There are no specific harms mentioned, however a disclaimer is included in the news release that \u201cWu cautioned that further study is needed to determine how best to harness cinnamaldehyde\u2019s metabolic benefits without causing adverse side effects.\u201d\nConsuming too much cinnamon can cause mouth irritation.

Should he get a regular blood test to screen for the disease?\n\nScreening for early detection of cancer sounds like a no-brainer, but it\u2019s not an easy choice for men considering regular P.S.A. tests, which measure blood levels of prostate-specific antigen and are used to detect prostate cancer. Though use of the test is widespread, studies show that the screening saves few, if any, lives.\n\nWhile the test helps find cellular changes in the prostate that meet the technical definition of cancer, they often are so slow-growing that if left alone they will never cause harm. But once cancer is detected, many men, frightened by the diagnosis, opt for aggressive surgical and radiation treatments that do far more damage than their cancers would have, leaving many impotent and incontinent.\n\nAs a result, major health groups don\u2019t advise men one way or the other on regular P.S.A. screenings, saying it should be a choice discussed between a man and his doctor.\n\nSo how does a man decide whether to get P.S.A. screening or not? Finally, some new research offers simple, practical advice \u2014 at least for men 60 and older.\n\nResearchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and Lund University in Sweden have found that a man\u2019s P.S.A. score at the age of 60 can strongly predict his lifetime risk of dying of prostate cancer, according to a new report in the British medical journal BMJ.\n\nThe findings also suggest that at least half of men who are now screened after age 60 don\u2019t need to be, the study authors said.\n\nThe researchers followed 1,167 Swedish men from the time they were 60 years old until they died or reached 85. During that time, there were 43 cases of advanced prostate cancer and 35 deaths in the group. The researchers found that having had a P.S.A. score of 2.0 or higher at the age of 60 was highly predictive of developing advanced prostate cancer, or dying of the disease, within the next 25 years.\n\nAbout one in four men will have a P.S.A. score of 2.0 or higher at the age of 60, and most of them will not develop prostate cancer, said the study\u2019s lead author, Andrew Vickers, associate attending research methodologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering. But the score does put them in a higher-risk group of men who have more to gain from regular screening, he concluded.\n\nThe higher the score at age 60, the greater the long-term risk of dying from prostate cancer, Dr. Vickers and his colleagues found. Men with a score of 2.0 or higher at age 60 were 26 times more likely to eventually die of the disease than 60-year-old men with scores below 1.0.\n\nStill, the absolute risks for men with elevated scores were lower than might be expected. A 60-year-old man with a P.S.A. score just over 2.0 had an individual risk of dying from prostate cancer during the next 25 years of about 6 percent, the researchers found. A 60-year-old man with a P.S.A. score of 5 had about a 17 percent risk.\n\n\u201cMost of those men are going to be absolutely fine,\u201d said Dr. Vickers. \u201cBut they can be told they are at high risk and they need screening.\u201d\n\nMen with a P.S.A. score of 1.0 or lower at age 60 had a very low individual risk of death from prostate cancer over the next 25 years, the study found: just 0.2 percent.\n\n\u201cThey can be reassured that even if they have prostate cancer or get it, it\u2019s unlikely to become life-threatening,\u201d said Dr. Vickers. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong case that they should be exempted from screening.\u201d\n\nThe advice is less clear for men with scores between 1.0 and 2.0 at the age of 60. They still have a very low individual risk of dying from prostate cancer, judging from the new data. The long-term risk of dying from prostate cancer ranged from about 1 percent to 3 percent for these men, and the decision to screen may depend on their personal views and family histories, Dr. Vickers said.\n\nWhile the findings don\u2019t answer all of the questions associated with P.S.A. screening, they should give peace of mind to sizable numbers of men who decide not to continue regular testing. The results also will reassure men who decide to continue with regular screenings that the benefits most likely outweigh the risks.\n\nDr. Eric A. Klein, chairman of the Glickman Urological and Kidney Institute at the Cleveland Clinic, said that he would like to see the findings of the new study independently confirmed, but that other studies also have suggested that the risk of cancer is low in men whose P.S.A. levels remain below 1.5 in their 50s and 60s.\n\n\u201cWe are in the midst of a paradigm shift in screening and risk assessment that no longer relies on a simple P.S.A. cutoff to determine who should be biopsied,\u201d Dr. Klein said.\n\nP.S.A. screening is already not advised for those 75 and older, because the slow-moving nature of the disease means that a vast majority of men at that age are likely to die from something other than a newly detected prostate cancer. A major study last year confirmed that P.S.A. testing is not helpful for men with 10 years or less of life expectancy.\n\nBut the advice continues to be murky for younger men. In a large European study reported last year, 50- to 54-year-olds didn\u2019t benefit from screening. But men ages 55 to 69 who had annual P.S.A. testing were slightly less likely to die from prostate cancer than those who weren\u2019t screened.\n\nThe researchers who conducted the latest study also have investigated whether a man\u2019s P.S.A. score at 50 can predict his long-term risk. In a 2008 report of 21,000 men published in the journal BMC Medicine, the researchers found that two-thirds of the advanced cancer cases that developed over 25 years were in men who had a P.S.A. score of 0.9 or higher at the age of 50.\n\nThose findings can help younger men decide how intensely they want to screen for the disease. A man whose P.S.A. test shows him to be at low risk at age 50 may decide not to be retested again until the age of 60. A man with a higher score may want to do more frequent testing.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t solved every single problem with screening,\u201d Dr. Vickers noted. \u201cWe need to screen fewer people, screen the right people, and we don\u2019t have to treat every cancer we catch.\u201d\n\nA version of this article appeared in print on September 28, 2010, on page D1 of the New York edition of The Times.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The potential harm that might occur by a man who stops screening at age 60 because his PSA level was low who might still go on to die from prostate cancer. \u00a0The story provided estimates of this.\u00a0\nWhile presenting interesting insights about prostate cancer risks, the story did not include any information about the accuracy of the PSA test itself.

Published today in the Journal of Oncology Practice, the study also determined that a systemized process of referrals resulted in significant improvements in 30-day readmission rates, hospice referral, and receipt of chemotherapy after discharge in patients with advanced cancers. This is the first study to demonstrate that among advanced cancer patients admitted to an inpatient oncology service, standardized use of triggers for palliative care consultation is associated with substantial improvement on multiple quality measures.\n\nPatients with advanced cancers often have significant symptoms that affect their emotional status, quality of life, and functional ability. The integration of palliative care improves symptom control and decreases unwanted health care use, yet many patients are never offered these services.\n\n\u201cAs cancer progresses, patients are often at high risk for physical pain and emotional distress,\u201d said Cardinale B. Smith, MD, MSCR, Associate Professor of Medicine (Hematology and Medical Oncology), and of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. \u201cHealth care utilization is extremely high once cancer progresses, with hospital readmission rates as high as 40 percent and death in the acute care setting ranging from 30-50 percent \u2013 both measures of poor-quality cancer care.\u201d\n\nTo improve the quality of care, researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine developed standardized criteria or \u201ctriggers\u201d for palliative care consultation for patients admitted to the cancer unit at The Mount Sinai Hospital. Patients were eligible for this prospective cohort study if they met one or more eligibility criteria: advanced solid tumor cancer, prior hospitalization within 30 days, hospitalization for more than 7 days, or active symptoms.\n\n\u201cCare for patients with advanced cancer is often characterized by time spent on acute-care hospital wards and intensive care units, or receiving invasive procedures, chemotherapy infusions, and radiographic imaging. Such interventions drive escalating costs and are often directly in conflict with patients\u2019 prior stated wishes,\u201d said Dr. Smith.\n\nConsultation with the palliative care team included establishment of goals of care, advance care plans using standardized communication protocols, transition planning and symptom assessment and treatment using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS). The palliative team was composed of one board certified PC physician, one nurse practitioner, one social worker, a chaplain, and one to two trainees.\n\n\u201cOur results highlight the need to adopt this practice at acute care hospitals across the nation,\u201d said Dr. Smith. \u201cPalliative care involvement helps patients understand their prognosis, establish goals of care, and formulate discharge plans in line with those goals, and this study is the first to confirm the impact of using standardized criteria and automatic palliative care consultation on quality of cancer care.\u201d\n\nCo-authors of the study include Kerin Adelson, MD, Division of Hematology/Oncology at Yale University School of Medicine.\n\nAbout the Mount Sinai Health SystemThe Mount Sinai Health System is an integrated health system committed to providing distinguished care, conducting transformative research, and advancing biomedical education.

So researchers have long sought a way to put back healthy insulin-producing cells, known as beta cells, into patients.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out a way to replace nature\u2019s solution,\u201d said Douglas Melton, co-director of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute.\n\nFor years, physicians have been using beta cells from dead donors. But because the immune system of the recipient recognizes the donor cells as foreign, patients who receive a transplant have to take immune-suppressing drugs for the rest of their lives.\n\nThose drugs are not ideal, because they carry a risk of infection or cancer. Plus, donors are in short supply and can\u2019t yield enough cells to treat the millions of people with type 1 diabetes around the world.\n\nThe researchers behind two studies published Monday demonstrated they had made progress on both fronts, encapsulating the cells in a protective bubble to shield them from the body\u2019s immune response, and creating beta cells from stem cells, which are potentially limitless.\n\nFor the capsules, the scientists homed in on alginate \u2014 a seaweed extract \u2014 as the starting material. Alginate allows sugar and insulin to flow between the cells and the body, but blocks immune cells from reaching the beta cells.\n\nThe problem with existing alginates is that the body eventually catches on to the material as a foreign substance, suffocating the implant in a layer of scar tissue. So, Daniel Anderson, a bioengineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, went in search of a better kind of alginate.\n\nIn one of two related studies published Monday, Anderson and his colleagues described in the journal Nature Biotechnology how they had tested 774 variations of alginate in rodents and monkeys and identified a handful that elicited a greatly reduced foreign body response.\n\nFor the other paper, published in Nature Medicine, the group embedded tiny capsules made from that durable alginate with beta cells derived from human embryonic stem cells. They then transplanted them into mice with a disease akin to type 1 diabetes.\n\nThe beta cells performed \u201cevery bit as good as the body\u2019s own cells,\u201d said Melton, a co-author on the Nature Medicine paper.\n\nThe transplanted cells controlled glucose levels in the mice without immune-suppressing drugs, the researchers reported. And when the scientists removed the capsules after almost six months, the cells were still cranking out insulin and there was little sign of an immune response to the capsules.\n\n\u201cFrom very early on, we were getting great success,\u201d said Arturo Vegas, a lead author of the papers who worked in Anderson\u2019s lab before moving to Boston University, where he is now an assistant chemistry professor.\n\n\u201cEverything kind of fell into place,\u201d Vegas continued. \u201cYou saw less foreign body response. The human beta cells survived exquisitely well.\u201d\n\nThe studies show \u201cyou can take stem cells and make a limitless supply of [human beta cells] and put them in a device and cure an entirely different species of animal,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nJust because the system produced strong results in mice does not mean people will respond the same way. But experts say the findings provide hope for future treatments for people.\n\n\u201cThis is really the first demonstration of the ability of these novel materials in combination with a stem-cell derived beta cell to reverse diabetes in an animal model,\u201d said Julia Greenstein, vice president of discovery research at JDRF, an organization trying to end type 1 diabetes that provided some funding for the studies. \u201cOur goal is to bring that kind of biological cure across the spectrum of type 1 diabetes.\u201d\n\nThe potential of the approach has attracted interest from both small startups and large biopharmaceutical companies that are looking at stem cell-based therapies for diabetes.\n\nOne company, San Diego-based ViaCyte, launched the first cell replacement clinical trial in 2014. Melton also recently helped start Semma Therapeutics, based in Cambridge\u2019s Kendall Square neighborhood. Semma has not begun any human clinical trials yet, but the goal is to develop a device that once implanted could control someone\u2019s blood sugar for a year or more, saving them from insulin injections and needing to check their blood sugar every few hours.\n\n\u201cThe individuals would not have to worry about that,\u201d Semma CEO Robert Millman said.\n\nOther companies pursuing stem cells treatments for diabetes include Novo Nordisk and BetaLogics, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson.\n\nMost of these other companies are taking a different approach from the work done in the studies published Monday.\n\nThe MIT team has developed tiny capsules for the cells, but ViaCyte, for example, has created a larger device outfitted with the cells that gets inserted under the skin. And whereas the Massachusetts researchers examined beta cells exclusively for their study, the ViaCyte team is exploring using less mature cells that, once implanted, differentiate into both insulin-producing beta cells and those that secrete another hormone called glucagon that\u2019s deficient in the disease.\n\n\u201cThe main issue with type 1 diabetes is a loss of beta cells,\u201d said ViaCyte CEO Paul Laikind, \u201cbut there\u2019s also good data out there to suggest dysfunction in other regulatory cell types.\u201d\n\nThe team behind the studies published Monday, meanwhile, is working on tests now in monkey models. Vegas said that if the primate studies are successful, the next step will be developing a therapy to be used in people.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve advanced the ball pretty far, almost as far you could get in an academic environment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe talk is shifting toward doing something clinically.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story makes a nod in the direction of harms when it notes that there was a minimal immune system response to the transplanted cells.

More than nine million patients underwent one of 12 such surgeries during the study period, and between six and 22 percent, depending on the surgery, were readmitted to the hospital within a month.\n\nMore than half the time, patients were readmitted or transferred to the hospital where they had the surgery.\n\nThose who returned to the original hospital were 26 percent less likely to die within three months of surgery than those admitted to a different hospital, as reported in The Lancet.\n\n\u201cPatients readmitted after surgery almost always have a postoperative complication, either medical or surgical,\u201d Drs. Justin B. Dimick and David C. Miller, both of the University of Michigan, wrote in an editorial.\n\nPatients readmitted at the original hospital also tended to be readmitted one to two days earlier than those who ended up at different hospitals.\n\nIt might be harder for patients to get appropriate care at the other hospitals, where they don\u2019t have a pre-existing relationship with a surgeon, and so treatment might be delayed, Dimick and Miller wrote.\n\n\u201cIf you are a surgeon or clinician who takes care of this person, it\u2019s intuitive that going back to that surgeon would influence how well they do,\u201d Brooke said.\n\nFor complex operations, some patients will fly to prestigious hospitals from several hundred miles away, he said.

Glick, director of the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Glick tells his patients about the new data but does not suggest they skip chemotherapy. After all, he notes, the national guidelines were based on results from large randomized clinical trials. And the recent data indicating that some women can skip chemotherapy are based on an after-the-fact analysis of selected clinical trials.\n\n\"We're in an era where evidence-based medicine should govern practice,\" Dr. Glick said.\n\nFor women with breast cancer, of course, the uncertainty is excruciating. Faced with a disease that already causes indecision and anxiety, they are now confronted with incomplete data, differing opinions from different doctors and a choice that can seem almost impossible: Should they give up a taxing treatment when all the answers are not in and they have what may be a fatal disease?\n\n\"If the medical profession is not even close to being of one mind, how is the woman to know?\" said Donald A. Berry, a statistician at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, the lead author of a recent paper questioning chemotherapy's benefits in many women.\n\nBarbara Brenner, who has had breast cancer and is executive director of the advocacy group Breast Cancer Action, said, \"There's a real problem,\" and added, \"We finally tell people at the end of the day: 'You're going to get a lot of information. Trust your gut. Nobody has the answers.' \"\n\n\"I'm really glad I was diagnosed 13 years ago,\" Ms. Brenner said, \"when there were fewer choices.\"\n\nDoctors worry, too. It took two years before the National Cancer Institute and its researchers could even agree on a design for the large new American study that will test the idea that many women might safely forgo chemotherapy.\n\nThe study, which starts enrolling patients at the end of this month, will involve women whose cancers are fueled by estrogen and have not spread beyond the breast. They will be randomly assigned to have the standard treatment \u2014 chemotherapy followed by a drug like tamoxifen that starves tumors of estrogen \u2014 or to skip chemotherapy and have treatment only with a drug like tamoxifen.\n\nUnlike the American study, the one now planned in Europe will also include women whose cancer has spread beyond their breasts into nearby lymph nodes. The American study may eventually add such women, said Sheila E. Taube, who directs the cancer diagnosis program at the National Cancer Institute.\n\nDr. Taube said the debate reminded her of one a few decades ago, when the question was whether all women with cancer needed mastectomies or whether many could have a lumpectomy instead. \"To me, the situations are analogous,\" she said.\n\nThe chemotherapy question starts with American and European guidelines that say almost every woman with breast cancer that has gone beyond its earliest stages, when it is confined to the milk duct, should have the treatment. And for good reason, many cancer researchers say: a series of large studies has shown that chemotherapy saves lives and that newer and more aggressive regimens are improvements over older ones.\n\nThat has led doctors to feel most at ease giving very aggressive treatments to almost everyone.\n\n\"Part of it is that this area of medicine we're practicing in is kind of a high wire act,\" said Dr. Michael Lee, an oncologist in private practice in Norfolk, Va. \"It is more comfortable to adopt things that are aggressive.\"\n\nBut most of those studies were done at a time when doctors did not distinguish between the 70 percent of women with breast cancers fueled by estrogen and the 30 percent whose cancers were not.\n\nNow Dr. Berry, the M. D. Anderson statistician, and a group of leading cancer researchers have found that the chemotherapy benefits in those clinical trials were concentrated almost exclusively in women whose cancers were impervious to estrogen. For the others, with estrogen-sensitive tumors, the lifesaving benefit came from hormonal therapy. The results of the analysis, published recently in The Journal of the American Medical Association, were the same even if the cancer had spread to the lymph nodes.\n\nThe drawback of that study, Dr. Glick notes, is that it was not a large prospective randomized clinical trial, the gold standard in medicine.\n\nThere is also another issue. What if some women with estrogen-fed tumors do benefit from chemotherapy? How can they be identified?\n\nOne possibility is new genetic tests, which are part of the two studies that are about to begin. The cancer institute is using the Oncotype DX test, which includes genes associated with response to chemotherapy, among them genes involved with a cell's response to estrogen.\n\nThe study is ethical, said Dr. Larry Norton of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, because the only women whose treatment will be decided at random are those in a kind of gray area, not women for whom chemotherapy would be a clear benefit or clearly unnecessary.\n\n\"I think the clinical trial is really a superb one,\" Dr. Norton said. \"I would like to see it go so we have definitive data.\"\n\nIn the meantime, some physicians, like Dr. Winer, are taking their own best shot at figuring out who really benefits from chemotherapy. He asks how sensitive the tumor is to estrogen, how aggressive a pathologist believes it is, how big it is, how much has spread to the lymph nodes and whether its surface has a type of protein, HER2, that is associated with a better response to chemotherapy. After talking through the decision with his patients, he says, he is comfortable omitting chemotherapy in some who would have had it not long ago.\n\nOthers, like Dr. Francisco J. Esteva of M. D. Anderson, use a computer program to calculate a woman's risks of recurrence and give the option of no chemotherapy only to women with low-risk cancers confined to their breasts.\n\nStill others, like Dr. Glick, are starting to tell women with estrogen-fed cancers that although they still need chemotherapy, they may not need the most intense treatment.\n\nAnd while some, including Dr. Winer, predict that the use of chemotherapy will almost certainly decline in the years ahead, for now most doctors are sticking with the current guidelines, waiting for expert advice from national panels on what to do.\n\n\"I don't know that many doctors who are comfortable giving women an option about chemotherapy,\" said Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, an advocacy group. \"A lot of physicians talk about the data, but then they say, 'But, to be on the safe side. ...' \"\n\nStill, doctors say it is not simply that they are urging more and more chemotherapy on patients. In many cases, it is patients who want the most aggressive treatment.\n\n\"A cancer diagnosis is earth-shattering,\" said Dr. Lee, who has had cancer himself. \"You stay up at night. You wonder. Even when you're doing well, you don't know whether to trust it.\"\n\nAnd so, he said, \"a lot of people will take a treatment even if there is a very low statistical chance that they will benefit.\"\n\nThat was what happened a few months ago, when Dr. Esteva told Janice Baty of Sulphur, La., a 40-year-old mother of two, that she might not need chemotherapy. After a long discussion with Ms. Baty and her husband, Dr. Esteva left them so they could decide what to do.\n\n\"My husband said, 'Look, we have two little kids,' \" Ms. Baty recalled. \"I called the doctor back in and said, 'We're doing the chemo.' \"\n\nWomen who say they want the most aggressive treatment may not fully realize what they are asking for, said Mary Peelen, 45, of San Francisco. Ms. Peelen learned in January 2005 that she had cancer. It was small, was fed by estrogen and had spread to just two of her lymph nodes. Her oncologist was adamant: chemotherapy was her only option.\n\n\"I felt frightened and very coerced,\" she said. She had an aggressive regimen, suffered terribly and was left with painful nerve damage in her arms and hands that prevents movements like opening jars or using scissors and frequently makes her drop things.\n\nMs. Peelen feels that in a way, she just missed the revolution, perhaps one of the last women with her type of cancer who will have to suffer so much.\n\nFor now, the answers as to who should have chemotherapy are far from clear.\n\n\"I think practice should change, but it's very dicey,\" said Dr. Berry, of M. D. Anderson.\n\nHis colleague Dr. Esteva says it is one thing for a statistician like Dr. Berry to look at retrospective data, and another for a physician, like himself, to sit down with a patient who has to make what may be a life-or-death decision.\n\n\"It's not a perfect science,\" Dr. Esteva said. \"A statistically small reduction in risk may be very important to some women, while for others chemotherapy is not worth it.\"\n\nAnd so, Dr. Esteva said, he is left asking many women with early-stage breast cancer to decide what can seem like the undecidable: whether they want \"to take something potentially toxic when you have a 90 percent chance of being cured without it.\"\n\n\"My experience ,\" he said, \"is that more want to get chemo than not.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not provide enough information on the potential short-term and long-term harms of chemotherapy. There is only anecdotal evidence from one woman who developed nerve damage. Common short-term side effects of chemotherapy can include nausea and vomiting, hair loss, and fatigue. Younger women may also experience early menopause and infertility as a result of certain chemotherapy regimens. Potential, though more rare, long-term side effects are more serious and may include: bone disorders, heart problems, blood clots and nerve problems.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Calcium in the arteries of the breast predicts early buildup of plaque in the heart's arteries, and may improve risk assessment in many women, especially young women\n\nRoutine mammography--widely recommended for breast cancer screening--may also be a useful tool to identify women at risk for heart disease, potentially allowing for earlier intervention, according to a study scheduled for presentation at the American College of Cardiology's 65th Annual Scientific Session.\n\nData from this study show for the first time a link between the amount of calcium in the arteries of the breast--readily visible on digital mammography--and the level of calcium buildup in the coronary arteries. Coronary arterial calcification, or CAC, is considered a very early sign of cardiovascular disease. Importantly, the presence of breast arterial calcification also appears to be an equivalent or stronger risk factor for CAC than other well-established cardiovascular risk factors such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes. Earlier research had shown a link between breast arterial calcification and atherosclerotic disease--even heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular disease events, but researchers said these data provide a more direct relationship between the extent of calcified plaque in the mammary and coronary arteries, as well as a comparison to standard risk evaluation.\n\n\"Many women, especially young women, don't know the health of their coronary arteries. Based on our data, if a mammogram shows breast arterial calcifications it can be a red flag--an 'aha' moment--that there is a strong possibility she also has plaque in her coronary arteries,\" said Harvey Hecht, M.D., professor at the Icahn School of Medicine and director of cardiovascular imaging at Mount Sinai St. Luke's hospital, and lead author of the study.\n\nAll told, 70 percent of the women who had evidence of breast arterial calcification on their mammogram were also found to have CAC as shown on a noncontrast CT scan of the chest. For women under 60 years of age with CAC, half also had breast arterial calcification--an important finding as very few would be thinking about or considered for early signs of heart disease. There were even fewer false positives among younger patients; researchers said that if a younger woman had breast arterial calcification, there was an 83 percent chance she also had CAC.\n\nNotably, breast arterial calcification also appeared to be as strong a predictor for cardiovascular risk as standard risk scores such as the Framingham Risk Score, which underestimates women's risk, and the 2013 Cholesterol Guidelines Pooled Cohort Equations, which tends to overestimate risk, Hecht said. When researchers added 33 asymptomatic women with established CAD, breast arterial calcification was more powerful than both risk assessment formulas, which suggests the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis may be a more important indicator of heart disease than other risk factors.\n\n\"This information is available on every mammogram, with no additional cost or radiation exposure, and our research suggests breast arterial calcification is as good as the standard risk factor-based estimate for predicting risk,\" Hecht said. \"Using this information would allow at-risk women to be referred for standard CAC scoring and to be able to start focusing on prevention--perhaps even taking a statin when it can make the most difference.\"\n\nMultivariate analysis showed that early signs of a buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries were most strongly related to breast arterial calcification. While CAC was about two times as likely with advancing age or high blood pressure, it was three times more likely with breast arterial calcification.\n\n\"The message is if a woman is getting a mammogram, look for breast arterial calcification. It's a freebie and provides critical information that could be lifesaving for some women,\" Hecht said, adding he hopes these findings will prompt clinicians, who rarely report breast arterial calcification, to routinely report not just the presence or absence of breast arterial calcifications but also to estimate and note the amount.\n\n\"The more breast arterial calcification a women has, the more likely she is to have calcium in her heart's arteries as well. If all it requires is to take a closer look at the images, how can we ignore it?,\" he said.\n\nA total of 292 women who had digital mammography and noncontrast CT scans within one year were included in the study. Of these, 124, or 42.5 percent, were found to have evidence of breast arterial calcification. Mammograms were reviewed by a second radiologist who was blinded to the CAC results. Women with breast arterial calcification were more likely to be older, have high blood pressure and chronic kidney disease, and less likely smokers. Women with established cardiovascular diseases were excluded. Breast arterial calcification was evaluated on a scale from zero to 12 by increasing severity, and CAC was measured on the CT using a validated 0-12 severity score. The overall accuracy of breast arterial calcification for the presence of CAC was 70 percent, and 63 percent of those with CAC also had breast arterial calcification.\n\nTo date, there is no consensus on using CAC as a screening test, though a very large outcome study of 39,000 subjects is underway in the Netherlands. Mammography, however, is widely used and accepted and, as Hecht said, may provide an opportunity to risk stratify asymptomatic women by breast arterial calcification who might have calcium in the coronary arteries and ordinarily would not have been readily considered for cardiovascular screening.\n\nHeart disease is the leading cause of death among women, yet breast cancer is often the most feared.\n\nRoughly 37 million mammograms are performed annually in the U.S. Mammography is recommended annually for women over 40 years of age by the American Cancer Society and every other year for women 50-75 years old and women at high risk for breast cancer by the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force. Digital mammography is more sensitive to the presence of calcifications and is now available in 96 percent of mammography units in the U.S.\n\nAnother intriguing point that deserves additional study, according to the researchers, is that the nature of the atherosclerosis is different in breast arterial calcification and CAC, making it unclear why one should be related to the other.\n\nHecht stresses that these findings warrant further evaluation and validation in larger studies. Future prospective trials are needed to see what the prognostic significance of breast arterial calcification might be. Because the study involved women who received both mammography and CT scan for clinical indications, these women may have been more likely than the average woman to have coexisting conditions, although Hecht said these were unrelated to heart disease.\n\nThis study is being published simultaneously online in JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging.\n\nIn an accompanying editorial in JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging, Khurram Nasir, M.D., M.P.H., and John McEvoy, from the Center for Healthcare Advancement and Outcomes at Baptist Health South Florida, said that the report provides impetus to document breast arterial calcification in mammography reports, to improve education of primary care and radiology providers on the link with heart disease, and other actions to establish best practices for incorporating this research into care.\n\n\"Even by the conservative estimate of 10 percent, approximately 4 million women nationwide undergoing screening mammography will exhibit breast arterial calcification; with 2 to 3 million of them likely to have signs of premature coronary atherosclerotic disease,\" the authors said. \"Whether the best use of breast arterial calcification is to trigger additional testing or to directly inform preventive treatment decisions, either by flagging high-risk women to their providers or by reclassifying traditional (heart disease) risk estimates, is worth further discussion.\"\n\nThe study was funded, in part, by the Flight Attendants Medical Research Institute.\n\nThe study, \"Digital Mammography: Screening for Coronary Artery Disease?,\" will be presented on April 3, 2016, at 9:45 a.m. CT/10:45 a.m. ET/3:45 p.m. UTC at the American College of Cardiology's 65th Annual Scientific Session in Chicago.

The guidelines say that doctors may consider elective induction at 41 weeks and should proceed with it at 42 weeks. But the question has some doctors reconsidering their assumptions about induction and has sparked criticism by women who contend there is already too much interference with uncomplicated pregnancies.\n\nThe question was presented in May at the yearly ACOG meeting in Washington: \u201cWhy not induce everyone at 39 weeks?\u201d Two doctors had been asked to debate: Errol Norwitz, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Tufts University School of Medicine, and Charles Lockwood, dean of the Morsani College of Medicine at the University of South Florida.\n\n[Here\u2019s what\u2019s being done to lower the maternal death rate]\n\n\u201cMy original assumption when asked to participate in this debate,\u201d Lockwood said, \u201cwas that Dr. Norwitz would take the \u2018pro\u2019 side since he has written about the risk of stillbirth after 38 weeks, and I would take the \u2018con\u2019 side since older literature suggested that C-section rates would likely be higher in the elective induction of labor at 39 weeks.\u201d\n\nNorwitz was a vigorous proponent. \u201cThere is no benefit to the fetus waiting beyond 39 weeks in well-dated pregnancies,\u201d he told the doctors. And as Lockwood reviewed research, he found that he was more and more in agreement with that point of view.\n\n\u201cBut Errol and I decided we would not tell each other which side we were taking in order to conduct independent assessments of the literature and report on our conclusions,\u201d Lockwood said. \u201cBeyond adding an element of suspense, this strategy allowed us to come to unbiased conclusions.\u201d\n\nAfter Lockwood found that recent studies suggest that elective inductions at 39 weeks decrease Caesarean delivery rates and might reduce the rate of infant and maternal complications, what was supposed to be a debate proceeded as a discussion in support of induction.\n\nBefore either doctor spoke, the audience in a crowded ballroom was polled: 63 percent opposed having most women deliver at 39 weeks, 20 percent supported it and 17 percent were unsure.\n\nNorwitz argued against simply letting nature take its course.\n\n\u201cNature is a terrible obstetrician,\u201d he said, referring to the \u201ccontinuum\u201d of pregnancy and birth: the large number of zygotes that never implant, the 75 percent lost before 20 weeks, and stillbirth.\n\nAnd, he said, the risk of stillbirth and neurological injuries rises after 39 weeks. \u201cStillbirth is a hugely underappreciated problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are anywhere between 25,000 to 30,000 stillbirths a year in the United States.\u201d\n\nLockwood and Norwitz\u2019s support for induction at 39 weeks not only surprised many of the doctors at the session, it also upset those who believe less intervention is the safest route for mother and baby.\n\nLabor may be induced by breaking the amniotic sac or by using hormones called prostaglandins or medication such as oxytocin, which can set off contractions. Labor can begin immediately or take a day or two; if it becomes too lengthy, Caesareans are performed.\n\nCristen Pascucci, an advocate for giving women more control over childbirth decisions, thinks the doctors\u2019 remarks suggest that all babies need to be \u201crescued by birth,\u201d creating an anti-woman mentality. \u201cIt\u2019s as if women and their babies are fundamentally in opposition to each other and the female body is dangerous by design,\u201d said Pascucci, a vice president of the advocacy group Improving Birth.\n\nPascucci, who is based in Lexington, Ky., travels the country speaking and consultingon issues related to birth rights. She said the induction recommendation \u201creinforces a century-old, pre-feminist American obstetric view that birth is pathological and the doctor\u2019s job is to extract the fetus from the incubator \u2014 like in the \u201950s, when every baby was pulled out of its shackled, unconscious mother by episiotomy.\u201d\n\nConsumer groups such as hers, she said, have been calling on ACOG to evolve toward care that is more centered on women. \u201cIt\u2019s disheartening to see how hard that\u2019s going to be for some physicians to do.\u201d\n\nLockwood and Norwitz are aware that there is strong opposition to induction at 39 weeks. \u201cI think a lot of this gets very emotional,\u201d Norwitz said.\n\nAlthough both doctors support induction at 39 weeks for all healthy pregnancies, Lockwood said that obstetricians shouldn\u2019t routinely adopt the practice just yet. As with any change in standard medical care, extensive research is needed before it can be safely and widely adopted. Even so, Norwitz thinks that \u201cit\u2019s a very healthy discussion to have.\u201d\n\nDue dates are calculated 40 weeks from the first day of a woman\u2019s normal menstrual period and, according to ACOG, full term is defined as a pregnancy that lasts between 39 weeks and 40 weeks and six days.\n\nAs he prepared for the debate, Lockwood created a micro-simulation model to predict the outcome of various care decisions, and results suggested lower rates of stillbirth, Caesarean delivery and maternal and neonatal complications for elective induction at 39 weeks. That prompted him to take the debate stage as a proponent of early induction.\n\nStill, he was surprised by an audience poll at the end of the discussion: 70 percent now supported the idea that women deliver at 39 weeks, 21 percent remained unsure and only 9 percent were against the idea.\n\n[I didn\u2019t understand the pressure to have a C-section until I was about to deliver]\n\nTraditional medical thinking assumes that early induction could lead to higher infection rates and the need for a Caesarean. But Norwitz said the evidence doesn\u2019t support that. Rather, he said, the latest literature suggests that the drugs available to soften the cervix in preparation for contractions help to decrease the Caesarean risk, adding a small caveat: For a small number of first-time mothers with \u201cunfavorable, long and hard cervixes\u201d \u2014 as opposed to cervixes that are soft and receptive to induction \u2014 the risk of Caesarean is increased.\n\nRebecca Dekker, who has a doctorate in nursing and founded the website Evidence Based Birth, which aims to make research on childbirth more accessible to families and professionals, watched a live stream of the session and described the presentations as misleading and the research as flawed. She called it \u201cconcerning and rash\u201d for doctors at the meeting to make \u201cbroad conclusions\u201d that \u201ccould potentially affect at least 3 million women a year in the United States alone.\u201d\n\nNorwitz said that the presentations were evidence-based. \u201cThis is my interpretation of the published literature,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a personal opinion based on belief or ideology.\u201d\n\nLockwood said he finds push-back inevitable and part of the broader scientific process.\n\nDekker said there were flaws in the research showing that women who received elective induction had lower rates of Caesarean delivery. For the women who waited for labor to start on its own, about half ended up being induced for medical complications. \u201cThey still analyzed the data as if the women had spontaneous labor, so it sways the results of the studies,\u201d she said.\n\nDekker isn\u2019t disputing that there are about 25,000 stillbirths per year or that this is a concern. However, she said a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report shows about half of stillbirths occur between 20 and 27 weeks of pregnancy, and the other half at later points.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that a blanket policy of 39-week inductions would not affect all of the stillbirths that happen before 39 weeks,\u201d Dekker said, adding that the CDC report concludes, \u201cDespite intensive investigations, for a substantial number of fetal deaths a specific cause of death cannot be determined.\u201d\n\nAnd, Dekker said, the public has the misconception that inductions are simple, noninvasive procedures. Pitocin, the most commonly used drug for induction, is classified as a high-alert medication that can increase the risk of patient harm if an error occurs. The drug can cause contractions that are too frequent, increasing the risk of decreased blood flow and oxygen to the baby, she said. Also, the drug can cause the placenta to detach from the uterine wall too early, and it can cause the uterine wall to tear.\n\nFor Dekker, the major benefit of spontaneous labor is avoiding the risks of a medical induction.\n\nThere are clear philosophical differences. One early morning in his hospital\u2019s labor and delivery unit, Norwitz said, he spoke with a midwife colleague who compared labor to walking through a forest. \u201cWe midwives stand behind the patient, and if she gets off the path, we coax her back onto it,\u201d she told him. \u201cObstetricians are in front of her, hacking through the forest.\u201d\n\nEsther Hausman, a certified nurse midwife in Concord, Mass., argues for restraint. \u201cSince we don\u2019t know exactly what triggers labor, why mess with it?\u201d\n\nHausman suggested learning from countries such as Denmark or Sweden, where midwifery is the first line of care and where fetal and maternal mortality rates are lower than in the United States. In a 2014 CDC report, the U.S. infant mortality rate (6.1 per 1,000 births) put it in 26th place among a selection of developed countries. Finland and Japan had the lowest rates (2.3 per 1,000 births.)\n\nDekker said that the ACOG debate should have instead compared the medical model of care to midwife-led care. Midwives are less likely than doctors to induce a woman electively, she said, and studies have found they intervene less than doctors and have more-satisfied patients.\n\nBeverly Siegal, a retired obstetrician-gynecologist in Newton, Mass., attended the debate and was among those who changed their thinking on induction.\n\n\u201cWhat changed [my opinion] at the end of the presentation was the really convincing argument that there is nothing gained for the baby to stay in beyond 39 weeks,\u201d Siegal said. \u201cI would personally recommend that any woman with a favorable cervix at 39 weeks be encouraged to get induced.\u201d\n\nOf course, Lockwood said, women should be heard.\n\n\u201cFinally, needless to say, it is expectant mothers that should have the final say as to whether to let nature take its course or undertake this potentially salutary but clearly artificial intervention,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut obviously our messages \u2014 how you talk \u2014 does make a difference,\u201d Norwitz said.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story quotes several opponents of earlier induced labor, who refer to risks including \u201cdecreased blood flow and oxygen to the baby,\u201d detached placenta and uterine wall tearing.\nWhile these harms are outlined in only vague and general terms, without specific numbers or citations, this at least acknowledges harms, so we\u2019ll rate as\u00a0Satisfactory.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The type of sugar you eat may affect your cravings for high-calorie foods, researchers report.\n\nAn experiment with 24 healthy volunteers found that compared with consuming glucose, consuming fructose \u2014 the sugar found in fruits, honey and corn syrup \u2014 resulted in more activity in the brain\u2019s reward regions, increased responses to images of food and a tendency to choose eating a high-calorie food over a future monetary reward.\n\nThe volunteers drank a 10-ounce glass of cherry-flavored liquid that contained two and a half ounces of fructose or glucose. (Table sugar, or sucrose, extracted from sugar cane or sugar beets, is a compound of glucose and fructose.) Researchers also took blood samples to measure levels of glucose, fructose and insulin, and of leptin and ghrelin, enzymes involved in controlling hunger and feelings of fullness.\n\nBefore having their drinks, the participants rated their desire to eat on a one-to-10 scale from \u201cnot at all\u201d to \u201cvery much.\u201d Then they drank the liquids and had functional magnetic resonance imaging brain scans while looking at images of food and of neutral objects like buildings or baskets. As they did so, they rated their hunger using the scale. The volunteers were then presented with images of high-calorie foods and asked whether they would like to have the food now, or a monetary award a month later instead.\n\nThe study, published in the journal PNAS, found that compared with glucose, consuming fructose produced greater responses to food cues in the orbital frontal cortex of the brain, a region that plays an important role in reward processing. The fructose drink also produced greater activity in the visual cortex when volunteers looked at images of food, a finding that suggests increased craving compared with glucose.\n\nWhen choosing between tasty high-calorie food or a delayed monetary reward, fructose drinkers were more likely than glucose drinkers to choose the food.\n\nThere was no difference in leptin or ghrelin levels between fructose and glucose drinkers. But plasma insulin response was sharply lower in fructose drinkers, which may affect what we eat, according to the senior author, Dr. Kathleen A. Page, an assistant professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California.\n\n\u201cInsulin is released when we consume glucose,\u201d she said. \u201cThe pancreas secretes insulin, and insulin drives glucose into cells so that it can be used for energy. But it also sends a signal to the brain that says \u2018you\u2019ve eaten.\u2019 Fructose doesn\u2019t stimulate insulin secretion, and if there\u2019s no insulin, you don\u2019t get the information that you\u2019re full.\u201d\n\nDoes this mean that it is a good idea to avoid fruit, because it contains fructose?\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Dr. Page said. \u201cDon\u2019t stop eating fruit. It has a relatively low amount of sugar compared with processed foods and soft drinks \u2014 maybe 5 grams in an orange, compared with 25 grams in a 12-ounce can of soda.

Generally, massage is not covered by insurance, Medicaid or Medicare.\n\nPrevious studies of the effectiveness of massage were conducted in controlled research situations. In this study, patients were referred by a physician to a massage therapist. The massage therapist designed and provided a series of 10 massages -- at no cost to the patient -- in a clinical treatment environment, mimicking the experience of people who choose to seek massage therapy in the real world.\n\nThe study also looked at different characteristics associated with patients being more likely or less likely to experience clinically meaningful change from massage. Among the study's findings:\n\nAdults in the baby-boom and older generations tended to be much more likely to experience clinically meaningful changes.\n\nObese patients experienced significant improvements, but those improvements were not retained over time.\n\nPatients who were taking opioids experienced improvements in their pain from disability in some cases but were two times less likely to experience clinically meaningful change compared to those who were not taking opioids.\n\nWhile the study results are promising, much more work needs to be done, Munk said: \"The fact of the matter is that chronic lower back pain is very complex and often requires a maintenance-type approach versus a short-term intervention option.\"\n\nAdditional investigation is needed to replicate the results of the initial study and to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of massage therapy, Munk said.\n\n\"Massage is an out-of-pocket cost,\" she said. \"Generally, people wonder if it is worth it.

More than 1.8 million smokers attempted to quit smoking because of the nine-week-long 2014 Tips From Former Smokers ( Tips ) campaign. An estimated 104,000 Americans quit smoking for good as a result of the 2014 campaign. The survey results are published in the March 24 release of the journal Preventing Chronic Disease.\n\nUnlike the 2012 campaign, which aired for 12 consecutive weeks, the 2014 campaign aired in two phases, from February 3 to April 6 and from July 7 to September 7. Phase 1 of the 2014 campaign ran ads primarily from the 2012 and 2013 campaigns; Phase 2 contained new ads. Those new ads featured people and their struggles with smoking-related health issues, including cancer, gum disease, premature birth, and stroke caused by smoking combined with HIV. About 80 percent of U.S. adult cigarette smokers who were surveyed reported seeing at least one television ad from Phase 2 of the 2014 campaign.\n\n\u201cCDC\u2019s Tips campaign has helped at least 400,000 smokers quit smoking for good since 2012,\u201d said CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H. \u201cTips is also extremely cost-effective and a best buy, saving both lives and money. With a year-round campaign we could save even more lives and money.\u201d\n\nTips, the first federally funded anti-smoking paid media campaign, features former smokers talking about their smoking-related illnesses. Smoking-related diseases cost the United States more than $300 billion a year, including nearly $170 billion in direct health care costs and more than $156 billion in lost productivity.\n\n\u201cThe Tips campaign is an important counter measure to the $1 million that the tobacco industry spends each hour on cigarette advertising and promotion,\u201d said Corinne Graffunder, Dr.P.H., director of CDC\u2019s Office on Smoking and Health. \u201cThe money spent in one year on Tips is less than the amount the tobacco industry spends on advertising and promotion in just 3 days.\u201d\n\nThe most recent Surgeon General\u2019s Report, The Health Consequences of Smoking\u201450 Years of Progress, called for airing effective messages such as the Tips ads with high frequency and exposure for 12 months a year for a decade or more. Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of disease and death in the United States, killing about 480,000 Americans each year.\n\nFor every American who dies from a smoking-related disease, about 30 more suffer at least one serious illness from smoking. And while the percentage of American adults who smoke is at the lowest level since the CDC began tracking such data, there are still an estimated 40 million adult smokers in the U.S. Surveys show about 70 percent of all smokers want to quit, and research shows quitting completely at any age has significant health benefits.\n\nTips ads encourage smokers to call 1-800-QUIT-NOW or to visit www.cdc.gov/tips to view the personal stories from the campaign.

Many of the electrodes sit in or near memory areas, and the wait can take weeks in the hospital. Cognitive scientists use this opportunity, with patients\u2019 consent, to present memory tests and take recordings.\n\nThis approach \u2014 called direct neural recording, and piggybacking entirely on the clinical placement of the electrodes \u2014 has become the leading edge of research into the biology of human memory.

The results will be presented in a poster presentation titled Lung EpiCheck \u2122 - Results of the Training and Test Sets of a Methylation-Based Blood Test for Early Detection of Lung Cancer at the IASLC 19th World Conference on Lung Cancer hosted by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, to take place on September 22-26, 2018 in Toronto, Canada.\n\nIn the study, blood was prospectively collected from 20 centers and 3 biobanks in Europe and Israel. The samples were used for detection of lung cancer with the Lung EpiCheck blood test. Lung EpiCheck was validated on this independent test set comprising 181 lung cancer cases and 141 current or former smoker controls. Results show specificity of 91% and a sensitivity of 74% with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 89%. These results demonstrated similar performance to the preceding training set results from 102 lung cancer cases and 265 current or former smoker controls.\n\nIn particular, in the non-small-cell lung carcinoma group (n=162), the most prevalent type of lung cancer affecting about 85% of lung cancer patients, Lung EpiCheck was able to identify correctly approximately 70% of patients. With a correct identification of 59% of stage I patients, 77% of stage II, 76% of stage III and 83% of stage IV patients.\n\nIn the small cell lung cancer group (n=13), Lung EpiCheck was able to identify correctly 92% of the patients, with a sensitivity of 100% in the limited stage, and 86% at the extensive stage.\n\n\"Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer worldwide due to the high incidence of the disease, and the low rate of diagnosis at early and more curable stages,\" stated Prof. Mina Gaga, the President of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and a lead investigator in the study. \"Clearly, we must establish screening programs for lung cancer worldwide. At the moment, low-dose computerized tomography (LDCT) screening which has been shown to reduce mortality from lung cancer in the very large NLST study is only reimbursed in the US for high-risk individuals. LDCT screening is not reimbursed in Europe or most areas in the world while there is still a debate about its cost and safety. Screening is however necessary in order to identify lung cancer at early, operable, stages for the entire at-risk population so currently, not only CT screening but also methods of molecular screening are being tested. I am therefore very encouraged with the results of this study, showing that EpiCheck has the ability to identify both non-small-cell and small-cell lung cancer at early stages, with a high level of sensitivity and specificity. Such promising results combined with the simplicity of the test, could allow us to detect lung cancer at the early stages and hence improve 5-year survival from about 15% to about 50-70%. This will offer significant added value in the fight against lung cancer.\"\n\n\"We are very excited to present the best published clinically validated results of a blood test for the early detection of lung cancer,\" said Opher Shapira, PhD, CEO of Nucleix. \"Furthermore, these results were validated prospectively in an independent cohort. Currently, early stage lung cancer can be detected either accidentally, when testing for other conditions, or by using low-dose CT scans, which are costly, carry associated risks such as high radiation, and are employed only for a very high-risk population. Early detection of lung cancer can be a game-changer in the fight against this devastating disease, and we are looking forward to begin extensive clinical trials in the US, Europe and China next year, in order to get the test to the market as soon as possible at an affordable price.\"\n\nThe Lung EpiCheck blood test is based on a proprietary molecular biomarker technology, which combines new biochemical assays and sophisticated algorithms. The technology is based on identification and analysis of subtle changes in DNA methylation patterns, a powerful tool for distinguishing between cancer and healthy cells and thus for detection of tumors in the body. Dying tumor cells release cell-free DNA (cfDNA) into the blood, where cancer-specific methylation changes can be detected at any disease stage. The Lung EpiCheck blood test detects changes in DNA methylation in 6 markers in cfDNA associated with lung cancer.\n\nLung cancer is the deadliest and most common of all cancer types. It is estimated that there are about 1.8 million new cases of lung cancer annually worldwide and about 1.55 million die from the disease each year. The reason for the high mortality rate is that currently most cases are detected when the patient becomes symptomatic, which is usually at late stages of the disease. To date, there is no adequate screening process for the early detection of lung cancer, bringing 5-year survival rate to approximately 15%. In addition, there is a well-defined risk group for developing the disease \u2013 mostly smokers and former smokers above the age of 50. In the US, low-dose CT is available for screening of individuals 55-79 years old who smoked at least 1 pack a day for 30 years, which represent less than half of the lung cancer population. Therefore, a screening test aimed at the entire risk group to assist in the early detection of the disease is highly needed and can dramatically increase lung cancer survival.\n\nNucleix Ltd. develops, manufactures and markets innovative, non-invasive, molecular cancer diagnostic tests.

Now, technology is dangling the possibility that women can stop that clock, at least for a while.\n\nIn a Manhattan office building on a recent evening, two dozen women \u2014 all in their 30s and 40s \u2014 sit in folding chairs, balancing cellphones and glasses of wine. They're gathered for a seminar called \"Take Control of Your Fertility.\"\n\nDr. Alan Copperman of Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York wastes no time laying out this harsh reality: By the time a woman hits her 40s, 90 percent of her eggs are abnormal. The chances of a typical 40-year-old getting pregnant in any given month? Ten percent. Unless, that is, she gets pregnant with her younger eggs \u2014 eggs she had frozen years before.\n\nCopperman explains the procedure, introduces someone who has gone through it and takes a flurry of questions.\n\nAfterward, women crowd a counter to set up appointments with Copperman's clinic, which offers egg freezing. Sally Montgomery is among the youngest here, and the most upbeat. Her mom had trouble conceiving, so she wants to be proactive.\n\n\"I'm 31, your typical New Yorker,\" she says. \"I'm single, I'm bouncing around, and I'd like the opportunity to have a family, so I just figured, 'Why not?' I don't think it's a guarantee, but it's a nice insurance policy, and I think it takes some of the pressure off.\"\n\nOthers, though, slip out quietly. One 40-year-old says she wishes she'd learned about egg freezing earlier. Esther Montoro, a 37-year-old photographer, looks a little stunned.\n\n\"I think it's fantastic,\" she says, \"but I think it's so incredibly expensive.\"\n\nThe whole process \u2014 a week of hormones, plus the procedure to collect the eggs \u2014 runs $12,000 to $14,000. And because it takes 10 to 20 eggs for a reasonable shot at success, some may need to do this several times. Plus, there are annual storage fees. Then, when you're ready to use your eggs, you'll need in vitro fertilization, another pricey procedure. All told, costs can easily exceed $40,000, money Montoro doesn't have.\n\n\"I guess there's a big assumption that most women that need to do this [are] career, successful, rich women,\" she says. \"And I'm not!\"\n\nIn his office later, Copperman empathizes and says he hopes the procedure eventually becomes easier and cheaper. Still, he says, freezing eggs offers many women the biggest game changer since the birth control pill 50 years ago.\n\n\"Women began to have reproductive choices,\" he says. \"They got to decide when not to get pregnant. This technology has the potential to help women decide when they can get pregnant.\"\n\nClinics in the U.S. have long frozen fertilized eggs, or embryos. But eggs alone are more delicate and prone to damage. Over the years, egg freezing has been offered mainly to cancer patients facing radiation, but success rates were pretty dismal. Of late, though, the technology has exploded thanks to scientific leaps, including a flash-freeze method called vitrification.\n\nIn Copperman's lab, you can hear the sizzle as a tiny tube is plunged into liquid nitrogen.\n\n\"Snap freeze, snap thaw,\" he says. \"And what's really impressive is that when it comes out, it comes out looking just like it went in.\"\n\nIronically, much of this research was pioneered in Italy and Spain, where Catholic influence discouraged the creation of too many embryos, leaving fertility researchers with unused eggs instead.\n\nWith the better survival rate from vitrification and other new freezing methods, more and more clinics are now offering what they call \"fertility preservation.\" Meanwhile, the early adopters are starting to come back and use their eggs.\n\nIn a New York high rise, 8-month-old Camden squeals in delight as she bounces in her walker. She's here thanks to eggs her mom froze several years ago.\n\n\"My best friend and I made a pact together that at age 38, if we were both still single, we were going to have a child on our own,\" says Robyn Ross.\n\nWhen that time came, Ross decided she wasn't ready for single motherhood. Instead, she froze 14 eggs. Within a year, she fell in love and soon got married.\n\nHer husband, Mark Cohen, says he wasn't at all put off by the fact that his new love had her eggs in the freezer. As it turned out, his sperm was weakened by earlier cancer treatment, so conceiving their baby in a lab was the perfect solution.\n\n\"And this is our miracle baby,\" Cohen says, planting a kiss on Camden. \"We are one little happy family.\"\n\nRoss has already evangelized to her younger sister.\n\n\"I made her promise me that if she's still single by the age of 32, she would freeze her eggs,\" she says. \"The younger the better.\"\n\nNow, before you run out to a fertility clinic, there is a big note of caution. The Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, which sets industry guidelines, still considers egg freezing experimental.\n\n\"If the question were just, 'Does egg freezing and thawing work to achieve a pregnancy?' I think we're close,\" says Dr. Eric Widra, a member of the society's executive council.\n\nBut only 1,000 to 2,000 babies in the world have been born using frozen eggs. So far, they're fine \u2014 no abnormalities. Still, Widra would like a larger-scale, longer-term track record. It's not clear when \u2014 or if \u2014 a big-scale study might happen. But Widra says women need to understand that success rates will never be 100 percent.\n\n\"It's an insurance policy that you may or may not actually ever need,\" he says. \"And it's an insurance policy that if you do need, may not pay out.\"\n\nAnd yet, even Widra agrees that egg freezing has appeal if it can help avoid the anguish of infertility. At Shady Grove Fertility, the Washington, D.C., clinic where he practices, he offers it to his own patients.\n\nThe Challenge Of Setting An Age Limit\n\nIt's quite a concept: Put your eggs in deep freeze and disconnect from that nagging biological clock. But, until when? How old is too old to use your younger eggs?\n\n\"There should be guidelines, I think, that are more clearly defined,\" says Dr. Geoffrey Sher, who heads the Sher Institutes for Reproductive Medicine and is based in Las Vegas.\n\nHe says many clinics suggest a cutoff of 50, the average age of menopause. After that, pregnancy can be riskier, and the large age gap raises complicated social issues. But the limit is tricky to impose. Sher remembers one couple who wanted to use donor eggs to conceive. The husband was 45, his wife, 55. Sher hesitated.\n\n\"And she said, 'That's discriminatory. If my husband was my age and I was his age, you wouldn't hesitate.' And she had a point,\" Sher says.\n\nThe woman was healthy. And the uterus doesn't decline like eggs do; in some cases, it can actually be coaxed back into working order. Sher's ethics board said OK.\n\n\"And she went ahead and had a baby at 57 years of age without any problems whatsoever,\" Sher says. \"I get a postcard from them at Christmas every year.\"\n\nThe bigger challenge, Sher and others say, is reaching out to younger women \u2014 getting them to take action before it's too late. They envision a time when society considers freezing eggs an act not of desperation but of empowerment.\n\nThis story was produced for broadcast by Marisa Penaloza.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "There are risks of pre-term pregnancy because of in-vitro fertilization.

Now, more are getting open-heart surgery, with remarkable survival rates rivaling those of much younger people, new studies show.\n\nYears ago, physicians \u201cwere told we were pushing the envelope\u201d to operate on a 70-year-old, said Dr. Vincent Bufalino, a cardiologist at Loyola University in Chicago. But today \u201cwe have elderly folks who are extremely viable\u201d who want to decide for themselves whether to take the risk, he said.\n\nEven 90-year-olds are having open-heart surgery, said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a Yale University cardiologist who has researched older heart patients.\n\nNot every older person can undergo such a difficult operation, he said but the great results seen in the new studies show that doctors have gotten good at figuring out who can.\n\nThe studies were reported at an American Heart Association conference this week in New Orleans.\n\nPeople 75 and older are the fastest-growing segment of the population; this group is projected to more than quadruple over the next 50 years. Forty percent have heart disease, and half will die from it. In recent years, surgical techniques, anesthesia and other medical care advanced, and death rates fell. That led more doctors to operate on older patients for everything from bum knees to bad backs.\n\nBut open-heart surgery is another thing \u2014 splitting open an aged chest and putting a patient on a heart-lung machine while doctors repair fragile blood vessels and weak valves.\n\nTreatment guidelines by the heart association and other groups do not have age cutoffs for such operations. It\u2019s been up to patients, doctors and insurers to decide whether to risk it.\n\nIn Florida, Dr. Paul Kurlansky led a study of 1,062 octogenarians who had heart bypass surgery at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach from 1989 through 2001. \u201cThe key issue here is not only, \u2018Can we operate and are they alive?\u2019 but \u2018How are they doing?\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nThe answer: Average survival was roughly six years \u2014 almost the same as similarly aged people who do not have heart disease. Overall, 90 percent survived their surgery to leave the hospital. This improved dramatically as the study went on, from 85 percent in the early years to 98 percent by its end.\n\nEven more impressive: 65 percent survived without any long-term complications \u2014 a \u201cvery, very remarkable\u201d result, Kurlansky said. Patients also reported a quality of life similar to others their age who did not have bypass surgery.\n\n\u201cWhat we are really dealing with is chronological age versus physical age,\u201d he said.

Among the most dispensed: eat a healthy diet, keep a healthy weight, avoid alcohol and tobacco and stay away from certain medications, such as blood pressure and depression drugs.\n\nNow, researchers publishing in the journal have found that another lifestyle change\u2014exercise\u2014may also help improve sperm quality.\n\nIn the study, Behzad Maleki at Justus-Liebig University in Germany and his colleagues recruited 280 sedentary, middle-aged men and randomly assigned them to one of three exercise regimens, or to no exercise, and followed them for six months. They wanted to see what effect different types of exercise, and different intensity activity, had on sperm quality and count. One group exercised at moderate levels continuously by walking or jogging on a treadmill, while another followed the same protocol but at a higher intensity. Another group did high intensity exercise on the treadmill but in short interval bouts.\n\nCompared to the control group that didn\u2019t exercise, all of the men who followed a physical activity program showed improvements in a variety of measures of their sperm. After six months, they showed less DNA damage, healthier sperm shape and lower levels of metabolic stress factors. They also showed higher numbers of sperm precursors.\n\n\u201cThis fits reasonably well with what we thought about the effects of exercise,\u201d says Dr. Peter Schlegel, vice president of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine and chairman of urology at New York Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. \u201cBut this is a much better done study than almost anything that\u2019s been done before on the subject.\u201d He notes that most previous studies did not randomly assign people to exercise groups and compare the outcome on sperm quality, but rather recorded sperm measures among men who reported their exercise habits after the fact.\n\nIn the current study, the men in the moderate intensity, continuous activity program showed the most improvements compared to men in the other two more intense groups. While it\u2019s not entirely clear why, part of the reason may have to do with the fact that extreme exercise generates body heat, which can be detrimental to sperm health; for marathoners and people training at intense levels, finding ways to dissipate body heat is a major concern. Schlegel also says that regular exercise can improve circulation and make the blood vessels healthier, which may benefit the testes, an organ that\u2019s sensitive to and requires good blood flow.\n\nExercise may also be working in other ways to enhance reproductive health, since all of the men who exercised lost weight, reduced their amount of body fat and improved their fitness levels. Fat tissue has been linked to higher levels of damaging metabolic stress compounds, so losing weight and becoming more fit may create more hospitable conditions for sperm and improve its quality and volume.\n\nThere are already plenty of reasons to exercise, and now better quality sperm is one more worth noting.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "There is no mention of potential harms in this story.

Larger studies in many more patients are needed before the drug will be available, though, she says.\n\nThe benefit is small and studies have been inconsistent, says researcher Rachelle Doody, MD, head of Alzheimer\u2019s disease research at Baylor College of Medicine.\n\nCalled solanezumab, the drug attaches to a protein called beta-amyloid that builds up and clumps together to form sticky plaques that riddle Alzheimer's patients' brains. The drug is designed to prevent those clumps from forming.\n\nOct. 8, 2012 (Boston) -- An experimental Alzheimer \u2019s treatment slowed memory loss by about one-third in people with mild Alzheimer's , offering hope that the drug can alter the course of the progressive disease.\n\nMaria Carrillo, PhD, a neuroscientist and vice president for medical and scientific relations for the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, calls the results \"encouraging\" and says she hopes development will continue.\n\n\"While [beta-amyloid] is the leading hypothesis of what causes the disease, that has remained unproven.

In the analysis, those given solanezumab had a 34% reduction in memory loss and other mental symptoms compared with those on placebo. There was even a hint that the drug helped to slow the decline in functioning.\n\nAsked if the 34% improvement in cognitive decline is meaningful to a patient, Carrillo said, \"I have a family member with AD.

Saxon, chief of the division of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine in Los Angeles, said in a news release from the American Heart Association.\n\n\"There's a lot of good news here,\" she added.\n\nSaxon and her team reported their observations in the Nov. 22 online edition of Circulation.\n\nCrunching the numbers, the authors determined that 92 percent of ICD patients survive one year out from device implantation. The same is true for 88 percent of CRT-D patients, they noted.\n\nFive years out, those figures dipped to 68 percent for ICD patients and 54 percent for CRT-D patients.\n\nAmong those outfitted with CRT devices alone, one-year survival was pegged at 82 percent, while five-year survival came in at 48 percent, the investigators found.\n\nThe poorer prognosis for CRT-only patients was attributed to their older average age (76 years), and the fact that they may be relatively sicker overall. Patients today tend to receive CRT devices with defibrillators.\n\nThe study team also found that patients whose implants were monitored remotely, on a continual basis, by a health facility network were about half as likely to die as patients who only had intermittent in-person assessments.\n\nRemote monitoring via telephone lines and online physician access is available for all ICD and CRT-D devices, the authors noted, and enrollment in such programs is typically free with a cardiologist's recommendation.\n\n\"It's highly likely the reason these patients did better is that they were receiving earlier diagnoses, and they were also empowered to take charge of their own health care more,\" Saxon said. \"I don't think there's any reason not to put a patient on it.\"\n\nDr. Eric N.

But at our facility we think it makes caring for a patient much easier. Physicians knowing things sooner will theoretically give a patient a better chance for quicker access to appropriate care.

Blood testing would allow pediatricians and other primary care doctors to diagnose allergies and treat many patients. But allergists contend that these generalists are not qualified to assess the laboratory results.\n\nDr. Dean Mitchell, an allergist in Manhattan, has virtually abandoned the skin-prick test. He was converted, he says, after taking a patient to the emergency room for a severe reaction to his skin test. Dr. Mitchell began to imagine a nearly needle-free office.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a longstanding fear of skin testing, and it turns off a lot of allergy sufferers from getting help,\u201d said Dr. Mitchell, the author of \u201cAllergy and Asthma Solution\u201d (Marlowe, 2006), which advocates oral immunotherapy, or allergy drops, instead of shots.\n\nFor that reason, he and other experts say, most sufferers never even see an allergist. (And many sufferers of seasonal and pet allergies know what they\u2019re allergic to, so they don\u2019t need a diagnosis.) For them, care has focused on treating symptoms with antihistamines and decongestants, not diagnosing the allergy and avoiding its triggers.\n\n\u201cThe question is, why aren\u2019t we identifying more children and adults suffering from allergic rhinitis and asthma to help them?\u201d Dr. Mitchell said.\n\nIn Europe, 60 percent of asthma patients are tested for allergies, compared with only 5 percent to 10 percent in this country. A lack of diagnosis may contribute to the worsening of symptoms in children \u2014 the so-called allergy march.\n\nIt begins with eczema in infants and toddlers, and progresses to respiratory problems and asthma in preschoolers and beyond. Half of babies who have eczema in the first two years of life will develop asthma in childhood, said Dr. Thomas A. E. Platts-Mills, president of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology.\n\nIn skin testing, a practitioner makes rows of pricks on a patient\u2019s back or forearm so allergen-containing extracts can seep into the skin. If the antibody IgE is bound to the immune system\u2019s mast cells in the skin, the patient will get an itchy, hivelike wheal surrounded by redness. The size of the wheal and the diameter of the redness help determine if the patient is allergic.\n\nA patient typically gets 15 to 20 skin pricks, but sometimes many more. Because the test comes with a small risk of a serious reaction, it should not be performed in very young children and pregnant women, among others.\n\nThe blood test, which is not without its own ouch factor, measures levels of circulating IgE. The lab sends the physician a report with these figures and the patient\u2019s risk of a reaction.\n\nThe first generation of blood tests were developed in the 1970s. Because they were not considered very sensitive, physicians were left with a lasting impression that blood testing was inferior to skin testing.\n\nA more sophisticated test with improved sensitivity, called ImmunoCAP, became available in 1992. It has performed equally well in comparison studies with skin-prick testing, said Dr. Jay M. Portnoy, chief of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology at Children\u2019s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Mo.\n\nStill, most allergists prefer skin testing. \u201cSkin testing is more sensitive and tells you more,\u201d said Dr. Dean D. Metcalfe, chief of the laboratory of allergic diseases at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. With blood tests, he went on, \u201cyou\u2019re not really measuring an allergic reaction, but a potential for a reaction.\u201d\n\nSkin testing produces an answer in about 20 minutes, compared with 48 hours for a blood test. The quick turnaround allows doctors to offer a diagnosis and immediate advice.\n\nBut skin-testing results can vary from one allergist to the next, and most allergists don\u2019t rely on a prior allergist\u2019s results when a patient switches practices.\n\nSome experts contend that allergists resist blood testing in part to protect their revenue. \u201cA barrier to allergy testing in the states has been the economics in our system,\u201d said Dr. Richard G. Roberts, professor of family medicine at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. If an allergist does an in-office skin-prick test, he gets the fees for those tests. If he requests a blood test, the laboratory gets the fee.\n\nBut others say allergists are simply more familiar with skin testing. \u201cThey have been trained to do skin testing, they\u2019re comfortable with it, and they get an answer in 20 minutes,\u201d said Dr. Portnoy.\n\nAllergists say some patients previously treated by primary care physicians were taken off foods like peanuts, though they never had an allergic reaction to them. Diagnosing requires a thorough medical history and interpreting the test results within that context; generalists may lack the time to do a complete history, especially under the pressures of managed care.\n\nDr. Roberts says that if primary-care physicians used the blood test, many more patients would be treated appropriately. While most allergy patients are seen by these generalists, he says, many allergies are not adequately diagnosed.\n\n\u201cCould we do a better job collectively?\u201d he asked. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\nSome allergists have made the switch to blood testing \u2014 especially in the area of food allergies, where blood testing is replacing the so-called food challenge test, a two- to six-hour procedure in which patients are given increasing amounts of suspect foods like egg or milk to determine whether they will have an allergic reaction.\n\nDr. Hugh Sampson, a food allergy expert at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, is seeking to add a level of precision to diagnosis. He correlates levels of specific IgE with a probability that the person is allergic to a food \u2014 a technique, he says, that reduces the need for food challenge testing by half.\n\nDr. Mitchell, the Manhattan allergist, called that approach promising. \u201cA lot of academic allergists are very conservative,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Hugh Sampson\u2019s work may turn the tide.\u201d\n\nAs for Sarah Marcus, starting last summer she was weaned from allergy shots so she would no longer need them when she went away to college, at the University of Pennsylvania.

In a small study from Spain, lupus patients showed dramatic improvements in skin lesions while taking the drug, lenalidomide (Revlimid), and most relapsed soon after they stopped taking it.\n\nThalidomide is best known as the drug that caused thousands of children to be born with missing limbs and other birth defects in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In more recent years it has been brought back to the market to treat a number of serious conditions, but its use is monitored closely to ensure that it is not taken by women who are pregnant or who might become pregnant. Dermatology professor Andrew G. Franks Jr., MD, of the NYU Langone Medical Center, says thalidomide is very effective for treating people with lupus skin conditions who do not respond to standard treatments such as steroids and antimalarial drugs. He says about 75% of patients with affected skin will go into remission with these standard treatments. \u201cThe question has been, \u2018What do you do with the rest?\u2019\u201d he says. Franks says thalidomide can help an additional 75% of patients achieve remission. But side effects are common and some, including nerve damage in the hands and feet, can be permanent.\n\nThe lenalidomide study included 15 women with lupus skin conditions; six had lupus in other areas of the body, too. They all were followed for seven to 30 months. All had received standard treatments, and 14 had been treated with thalidomide previously. The majority of the patients (60%) had the most common subtype of lupus-related skin disease, known as discoid lupus erythematosus, which is characterized by red, scaly patches that can scar.

Many of those were single vitamins in larger doses than the \"100% of daily value\" amounts that multivitamins typically contain.\n\nScience on vitamins has been skimpy. Most studies have been observational \u2014 they look at groups of people who do and do not use vitamins, a method that can't give firm conclusions.\n\nDr. J. Michael Gaziano, of Brigham and Women's Hospital and VA Boston, led a stronger test. Nearly 15,000 male doctors who were 50 or older and free of cancer when the study started were given monthly packets of Centrum Silver or fake multivitamins without knowing which type they received.\n\nAfter about 11 years, there were 2,669 new cancers, and some people had cancer more than once. For every 1,000 men per year in the study, there were 17 cancers among multivitamin users and more than 18 among those taking the placebo pills. That worked out to an 8% lower risk of developing cancer in the vitamin group.\n\nMultivitamins made no difference in the risk of developing prostate cancer, which accounted for half of all cases. They lowered the risk of other cancers collectively by about 12%. There also was a trend toward fewer cancer deaths among multivitamin users, but the difference was so small it could have occurred by chance alone.\n\nSide effects were fairly similar except for more rashes among vitamin users. The National Institutes of Health paid for most of the study. Pfizer Inc. supplied the pills and other companies supplied the packaging.\n\nThe main reason to take a multivitamin is to correct or prevent a deficiency, \"but there may be a modest benefit in reducing the risk of cancer in older men,\" Gaziano said.\n\nCancer experts said the results need to be confirmed by another study before recommending multivitamins to the public. These participants were healthier \u2014 only 4% smoked, for example.\n\nFor people who do want to take multivitamins, doctors suggest:\n\n\u2014 Be aware that they are dietary supplements, which do not get the strict testing required of prescription medicines.\n\n\u2014 Ask your doctor before taking any.

Genetically engineered drugs, made by altering a cell's DNA or other genetic material, all cost more than $10,000 a year.\n\n\"It'll find a particular niche where it'll be used, but I don't see it as taking over the market,\" said Dr. Sundeep Khosla, a professor and osteoporosis researcher at the Mayo Clinic.\n\nStill, he called the drug a \"tour de force of modern molecular medicine\" because it is potent and was designed by making antibodies cloned over and over from cells in the lab to block one pathway involved in the how the body naturally breaks down bone cells.\n\nDenosumab would be the first osteoporosis treatment that is such a monoclonal antibody \u2014 a type of immune cell cloned from the same parent cell to bind to a specific substance. In this case, it targets a molecule in bones that drives formation of cells called osteoclasts that break down bone, a strategy that greatly reduces bone loss.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday released its review of denosumab, with staff citing concerns about increased rates of skin infections and some tumors. That report comes just ahead of a meeting Thursday when outside advisers will weigh the drug's safety and effectiveness and recommend whether to approve it.\n\nAmgen shares rose $1.57, or 2.6 percent, to close at $62.81.\n\nDenosumab, an injection just under the skin, would have to compete against eight major types of pills and injected medicines, including estrogen and generic and brand-name Fosamax pills, long the market leader.\n\nMost of those must be given more often, with pills swallowed once a day, week or month, a nasal spray inhaled daily, and one injection under the skin given daily. But another injection given intravenously is only needed once a year, and estrogen, while out of fashion due to its link to breast cancer, is available in skin patches changed once or twice a week.\n\nThose drugs' annual retail cost can range from $385 for generic Fosamax, to roughly $1,250 for most brand-name pills, to $11,100 for injected Forteo, which must be injected daily.\n\nGlobal sales of osteoporosis treatments, including hundreds of vitamin brands, hit nearly $8.4 billion last year, according to data from IMS Health. About 10 million Americans have osteoporosis.\n\nAnalyst Steve Brozak of WBB Securities said denosumab will pass the $1 billion annual sales threshold for blockbusters, but it's unclear by how much.\n\n\"You're going to have blowback by insurers\" over how much they will pay, he said, but Amgen might try to charge more than $10,000 per year.\n\nDr. Lenore Buckley, a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, said all these drugs carry some risks. The studies found denosumab caused eczema in some patients, and a dozen of the women got a serious skin infection, cellulitis, that sometimes required hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics.\n\n\"Because this drug affects the immune system, the long-term effects on cancer risk or immune function is still unknown,\" she warned, saying she expects FDA will require Amgen to track risks over time if the drug is approved.\n\nThe effectiveness of denosumab and existing drugs appears to plateau after two or three years, she added.\n\nThe two studies were released Tuesday by the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nAmgen, of Thousand Oaks, Calif., paid for both. Nearly all the researchers receive consulting, advisory and other fees from the company and competitors, or are Amgen employees. The biotech company designed the studies, handled data collection and analysis, and helped write the journal reports.\n\nOne study included 7,868 women, aged 60 to 90, with moderate to severe osteoporosis. Half got denosumab injections every six months for three years. They had 68 percent fewer spine fractures and 40 percent fewer hip fractures than the study participants who got dummy shots.\n\nThe second study included 1,468 men with prostate cancer at increased fracture risk due to cancer hormone therapy, although 556 dropped out for reasons from side effects and cancer progression to the study being extended from two to three years. Denosumab cut the risk of spine fractures 62 percent over three years compared to dummy shots. Spine bone density loss was far smaller for those given the drug.\n\nUntil recently, studies of osteoporosis drugs just measured changes in bone density, assumed to equate with lower fracture risk. Newer studies also measure fracture rates, but there are no head-to-head studies on that.\n\nHowever, based on some prior studies, independent experts say denosumab appears more effective at preventing spine fractures than three older pills \u2014 Fosamax, Actonel and Boniva \u2014 and calcitonin nasal sprays, which all use various pathways to slow down cells called osteoclasts that break down bone. Experts think denosumab prevents spine fractures about as well as Reclast, an intravenously injected drug that slows bone breakdown, and daily just below the skin injections of Forteo, the only drug that stimulates bone-building cells called osteoblasts. And denosumab appears to prevent fractures of the hip, forearm and ankle about the same as all those drugs.\n\nDr. Jacob Warman, an osteoporosis expert at Brooklyn Hospital Center, said denosumab might have potential as an add-on to existing drugs to boost results. He expects that would be covered by insurers, who pay for multiple medicines for other conditions.\n\nAmgen spokeswoman Kerry Beth Daly said the company has not yet set a price for the drug, but will try to keep it affordable. She said pricing also will reflect denosumab's twice-a-year dosing.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Citing the FDA\u2019s review of denosumab, as well as the adverse risks reported in the trials, the story mentions that this drug is associated with an increased risk of skin infections and some tumors.\u00a0 The story also points out that its long-term effects on cancer risk and the immune system are unknown.

Studies have shown that people in parts of the world who eat more fish have lower rates of heart disease, and fewer heart attacks (though the same can\u2019t necessarily be true of those who take supplements\u2014see this piece \u201cFish Oil Is Hugely Popular\u2014But Should You Take It? for more on that).\n\nOne thing that has been less clear is what role fish oil plays in people who have already had a heart attack. Can omega-3 fat provide similar benefit? Researchers led by Dr. Raymond Kwong at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital wanted to find out, so they took advantage of more sophisticated imaging techniques that can provide detailed pictures of the heart and how it\u2019s changing in the days and weeks after a heart attack.\n\nFor the study, published in the journal , they studied nearly 360 people who recently had a heart attack, who were randomly assigned to take 4g of omega-3 fatty acids or a placebo pill for six months. (That\u2019s a high dose; a 3 oz. portion of salmon contains anywhere from half a gram to 1g of omega-3.) Every two months, the volunteers came in for an MRI of their heart to track how much the muscle was changing.\n\nNormally after a heart attack, part of the heart is starved of oxygen, and that portion never recovers. The remaining healthy tissue starts to compensate for the compromised tissue, but has to work harder to maintain the heart\u2019s normal pumping function. Over time, this overworking can lead to scar tissue and start to restrict even the healthy tissue\u2019s ability to do its job.\n\nKwong and his team found that people taking the high dose of omega-3 fats showed 6% less of this decline in heart function than those taking placebo. What\u2019s more, the people who showed the highest blood levels of the omega-3 fats (people absorb it at different rates) showed the greatest reduction in scarring \u2014 13% \u2014 compared to those with the lowest levels. The effects remained strong even after the researchers accounted for the fact that all of the people were taking standard heart disease treatment drugs, including cholesterol-lowering statins and blood pressure medications.\n\n\u201cThe omega-3 fatty acids seem to be preventing scarring of the otherwise healthy muscle that now has to overwork because of the heart attack,\u201d says Kwong.\n\nBased on analysis of their blood samples, the people taking omega-3 supplements also showed lower levels of inflammatory markers, which suggests that the fish oil may be working by reducing inflammation following a heart attack.\n\nIt\u2019s the first encouraging strategy for protecting the heart a heart attack; the more remaining healthy tissue that can be saved, the stronger the heart will be.\n\nKwong says that the findings are only the first step toward considering whether omega-3 fatty acid supplements should be part of every emergency heart attack response. The 4g is a high dose; previous studies in which people were given 1g of fish oil were more inconsistent. Most of the people also started taking the supplements two to four weeks after their heart attack. Might they have benefit more if they had started taking the supplements sooner? How much omega-3 is needed to start remodeling the heart in a beneficial way?\n\nThese are questions Kwong and others hope to answer with more studies. Kwong collected blood samples from the volunteers and will be studying them for hints about how omega-3 fatty acids are working in the body after a heart attack. \u201cTo say every [heart attack] patient should be taking omega-3 fatty acids right away is a bit premature,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I do think it\u2019s logical that our results hold promise, and may reduce bad outcomes in patients after a heart attack.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Harms should have been included.\nAs made clear in a New York Times story, Dr. James Stein of the preventive cardiology department at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics explained that \u201cfish oil can be hazardous when combined with aspirin or other blood thinners.\u201d This seems particularly pertinent here as post heart-attack patients are often\u00a0recommended to take aspirin.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "A Harvard researcher hopes an old arthritis drug, which he read about in a 19th century German medical journal, could be a cheap new treatment for diabetes.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Steven Shoelson's research suggested that the drug, called salsalate, might also help diabetics.

Symptoms including serious memory loss, confusion and mood changes develop gradually and worsen with time. Recently, many strides have been made in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease earlier, but doctors have been stymied by a lack of effective treatments to stop or slow the course of the disease.\n\nIt's long been known that a protein fragment called beta-amyloid builds up in the spaces between nerve cells in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease. The new drug, gantenerumab, targets these amyloid proteins by priming the body's immune system to recognize them as invaders.\n\nOf 16 people with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease, those who received two to seven infusions of the experimental drug every four weeks showed marked reductions in the amount of plaque in their brains via imaging tests that were conducted several months after their treatments.\n\nBy contrast, amyloid load increased among people who were randomized to receive the placebo. The new drug was given at either 60 or 200 milligrams (mg) doses. The higher dose yielded greater reductions in amyloid levels, the study showed. People who were given the 60 mg doses saw a nearly 16 percent reduction in the amount of amyloid, and those given the 200 mg doses saw a 36 percent reduction. The new study was conducted and funded by the drug's manufacturer, F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd., in Basel, Switzerland.\n\nThe big question is whether or not reducing amyloid levels has any effect on the symptoms or progression of Alzheimer's disease, said Dr. Patrick Lyden, chief of neurology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. \"There is a growing concern that amyloid is a guilty bystander, but not the actual culprit in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease, and taking away the bystander may not help the patient,\" he said.\n\nThere are approximately one dozen therapies, including vaccines, for Alzheimer's disease that are currently in the pipeline, Lyden noted. \"They are all extremely exciting and promising in animals,\" he said. \"This is the first one to show a preliminary result in people, but we have a huge way to go to make sure it is safe and improves symptoms.\"\n\nMany in the Alzheimer's research community are awaiting these drugs with bated breath, but \"none are ready for prime time,\" he said.\n\nThe leading theory of Alzheimer's disease is that an imbalance in the production or clearance of the amyloid plaque in the brain initiates a cascade of events that lead to dementia, explained Dr. Neelum Aggarwal, an associate professor of neurological sciences at Rush Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.\n\n\"Accumulation of the plaques cause a variety of cellular responses: inflammation, neuronal death, and thus any potential treatment that can alter these processes would be beneficial,\" she said. The hope is that gantenerumab or other drugs like it will not only prevent amyloid from accumulating in the brain, but also slow down the cognitive impairment that occurs in people with Alzheimer's disease, she added.\n\nThat said, these experimental drugs carry the potential for serious side effects, including causing the immune system to go haywire. \"The main issue that remains for this type of drug development is managing the immune response,\" Aggarwal said. Other side effects include a potentially fatal fluid build-up in certain areas of the brain. \"This is problematic in that use of these treatments may carry a very high risk for neurologic complications, thus necessitating heightened monitoring, and diminishing its applicability as a treatment for a larger patient population such as the Alzheimer's disease population,\" she said.\n\nIf any of these drugs make it through the pipeline, it also needs to be determined who will get them, including whether the drugs will be given to prevent Alzheimer's in patients at high-risk of the disease or to treat it once it's started.\n\nThe need for a drug to delay the onset or slow progression of Alzheimer's disease can't be underestimated, Aggrawal said. In the United States alone, there are 5.4 million people with Alzheimer's disease, and the numbers are expected to increase to 13 million by 2050, when approximately three of every five people over the age of 85 will have Alzheimer's disease, she said.\n\nFor more information about Alzheimer's disease signs, symptoms and treatments, visit the Alzheimer's Association.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "A strict application of this criterion warrants an unsatisfactory score.\u00a0 HealthDay only discussed \u201cpotential for serious side effects\u201d but didn\u2019t report how often they occured.\nWebMD, by comparison, gave specifics that two of six patients receiving the highest dose \u201cdeveloped possible findings of vasogenic edema, or fluid collecting in the brain tissue, as well as micro-hemorrhages.\u201d\nTo its partial credit, HealthDay did discuss several potential side effects, but why not report what was actually observed in the study you\u2019re reporting on?", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Cleveland, Ohio (CNN) -- Diana Tirpak was so sure her leukemia was going to kill her, she bought a suit for her husband, Jake, to wear at her funeral.\n\n\"I was bound and determined he was going to look fine at the funeral,\" says Tirpak, 68, a retired school nurse in Hudson, Ohio.\n\nUntil recently, Tirpak would have faced a death sentence without a bone marrow transplant. But Tirpak's physician, Dr. Mary Laughlin, turned to something deemed medical waste until recently: umbilical cord blood.\n\nCord blood is rich in stem cells and easier to match than adult bone marrow because the immune cells are not developed. Also, patients can get the treatment in about three weeks -- as opposed to six to eight for bone marrow from an adult donor, said Laughlin, founder and medical director of the Cleveland Cord Blood Center.\n\n\"That can be a critical time interval for a patient who is in remission,\" she said, noting that doctors often fear a patient's relapse while awaiting the transplant.\n\nTraditionally, patients with leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma have first tried to find an adult bone marrow donor either from a close relative or from a national bone marrow registry. But the registry's more than 12 million donors meet the needs of only about 60 percent of Caucasians in the United States and only 5 to 15 percent of minorities, who are underrepresented. Even siblings are not a sure thing, with the chance of matching a brother or sister only 25 percent.\n\nNathan Mumford, who is African-American, tried to find a bone marrow donor after his leukemia was diagnosed not long after he graduated from college.\n\n\"We went through that process, and nobody had a match. Siblings are the best matches. My brother or my sister wasn't a match. My friends, aunts, uncles, cousins, nobody was a match. So, couldn't go that route,\" Mumford said.\n\nAt that point, Mumford said, his choices were to continue chemotherapy and live for, maybe, another year and a half. Or he could try a cord blood stem cell transplant.\n\n\"That was an opportunity,\" said Mumford, who survived Hodgkin's disease as a child. \"That was a chance for me to live. I'm not a quitter. I've never been a quitter, so I wasn't going to quit.\"\n\nMumford received a cord blood stem cell transplant in November 2004. In such transplants, patients have chemotherapy, radiation or both to kill the cancer cells and to suppress the immune system so that the new stem cells are not rejected. Then, the stem cells are injected into the patient's body and travel to the bone marrow cavities, where they create new, healthy marrow. Mumford, who's now 30, says he's never felt better.\n\n\"I just feel amazing,\" he said. \"I have a lot of energy, and I'm just excited about it.\"\n\nMumford lives in Cleveland and runs the Karen E. Mumford Foundation. The nonprofit, named for his mother, who died of breast cancer while he was being treated, provides emotional and financial assistance to cancer patients.\n\nTirpak and Mumford represent a growing number of patients taking advantage of stem cells from cord blood, which can be used in patients with leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma. Cord blood transplants among unrelated donors have risen from 1 percent in 2001 to 24 percent last year, Laughlin says.\n\nNationally, more than 200 hospitals accept cord blood donations. Parents must decide before birth whether to bank a child's cord blood. If they do, it's collected immediately after birth, processed, registered in a national database and kept frozen. If collected and stored for private use, the procedure can cost as much as $2,000 or more, plus annual storage fees.\n\nPublic blood banks collect and store the cord blood free of charge. Those parents get their own child's blood unless it has already been given out as a match for someone else. In that case, other matching blood is made available free of charge.\n\nCord blood stem cell transplants have the same risks as adult bone marrow transplants: the new blood rejecting the host, called graft-versus-host disease. And patients still must endure months of recovery. Well worth it, say Mumford and Tirpak, who received her stem cell injection two years ago.\n\n\"Such a tiny few drops of blood cells really give new birth to people,\" Tirpak said.\n\nOn Saturday, her husband, Jake, finally wore the suit he had been saving for his wife's funeral -- at a family wedding.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "See the larger discussion of the evidence evaluation.\nThe story mentions that the procedure has the same risks as adult bone marrow transplants, and that the procedure requires months of recovery.

While both drugs reduced cases of breast cancer by about half from what would have been expected for the women in the study, raloxifene caused fewer cases of blood clots, cataracts and uterine cancers, making it initially appear the winner.\n\nBut raloxifene's edge in blood-clot and uterine-cancer avoidance was not statistically significant, and tamoxifen proved better at reducing the rate of noninvasive breast cancer. So, in response to the cancer institute's announcement two months ago, some experts quickly declared that raloxifene was not clearly superior, leaving women in a quandary.\n\nTamoxifen, a generic drug, is already approved for reducing the risk of breast cancer. Raloxifene, sold by Eli Lilly & Company under the name Evista, is now approved only to prevent bone-thinning.\n\nThe new information presented here and published in the medical journal included a detailed analysis of the side effects of the drugs and the results of a survey of about 10 percent of the 19,747 women in the trial concerning their physical and mental well-being.\n\nThere was no overall difference between the drugs in the women's self-rated physical health, mental health or depression. But hot flashes, vaginal bleeding, bladder control problems and leg cramps were more common in the women who took tamoxifen, while pain during sexual intercourse and joint pain were more common in the raloxifene group.\n\nThe new data are not likely to settle the debate about which drug is better. \"Although media coverage of the early release of data from the STAR trial suggests a clear 'winner' in raloxifene, the data from clinical endpoints and patient-reported symptoms suggest a less clear conclusion,\" Dr. William J. Gradishar and David Cella of Northwestern University wrote in an editorial in the medical journal.\n\nDr. Patricia A. Ganz of the University of California, Los Angeles, who presented the quality-of-life data here, said decisions should be made based on each woman's circumstances. If a woman is worried about uterine cancer, she might use raloxifene, Dr. Ganz said. If an active sex life is important to her, a woman might prefer tamoxifen.\n\nBut Dr. Ganz said that side effects of both drugs were generally mild and that it was important that women at high risk of breast cancer take one of them.\n\nRelatively few women at high risk of breast cancer take tamoxifen, and some patient advocates question whether they should, saying many women are exposed to side effects for each case of cancer prevented.\n\nThe editorial in the journal said the new data \"still may not be enough to convince primary care physicians to be more aggressive than they have been to date in breast cancer chemoprevention.\"\n\nAs for the data on vaginal and vulvar cancer prevention, they came from combining data from three trials used to test the ability of the vaccine, Gardasil, made by Merck & Company, to prevent cervical cancer.

That made the vaccine 81 percent effective, said Dr. Jorma Paavonen of the University of Helsinki, the lead author.\n\nWhen the researchers looked only at lesions caused by the particular viral strains in the vaccine, they found no cases in the vaccinated group and 24 in the placebo group.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "While the story lists the possible side effects and harms of the study medications, it does not mention how often these problems happened, nor how much they bothered women who had them.

One subject, a 30-year-old male, hasn't taken insulin since his stem cell transplant more than three years ago, according to the study in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nThe study suggests a new avenue for treating the intractable disease, in which the immune system destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Without insulin, patients can't metabolize sugar and risk developing nerve damage, cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, and blindness.\n\nPatients with Type-1 diabetes typically compensate by monitoring their blood sugar levels every few hours and injecting themselves with insulin as many as five times a day.\n\nAfter the stem cell treatment, \"patients are absolutely medication-free; they're off insulin,\" said Dr. Richard Burt, chief of the division of immunotherapy at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine and senior author of the study.\n\nThe strategy is similar to an approach showing some success in treating other immune-system disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and multiple sclerosis.\n\n\"We all realize that without addressing the problem at the level of the immune system, we'll never really beat Type-1 diabetes,\" said Dr. Francisco Prieto, who treats diabetics in Elk Grove, Calif., and wasn't involved in the study. \"This is very encouraging work.\"\n\nBurt and his colleagues cautioned that they don't yet know whether the fix is permanent and, if it is not, how long it will last. One of the subjects was insulin-free for one year but then relapsed after a respiratory viral infection, said lead author Dr. Julio Voltarelli, associate professor at Ribeirao Preto Medical School at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil.\n\nThe researchers also cautioned that the process is not without risk, with patients vulnerable to infection during part of the therapy.\n\nBut other doctors said that even if the benefits of the therapy are temporary, the research provides valuable insight into the mechanism behind the disease.\n\nThe Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation in New York estimates that as many as 3 million Americans have Type-1 diabetes, with between 30,000 and 35,000 new cases diagnosed each year.\n\nThe age of onset is considerably younger than for Type-2 diabetes patients, who can still make insulin but can't use it efficiently.\n\nThe stem cell approach mirrors the bone marrow transplants used to treat patients with certain cancers and blood diseases. The idea is to wipe out the faulty immune system and replace it .\n\nIn the study, 15 Brazilian patients were treated within a few months of their diagnosis, before their immune systems had the chance to eradicate all of their insulin-producing cells.\n\nThe study was conducted in Brazil because of Voltarelli's interest in the experiment. It was funded by the Brazilian Ministry of Health and other sources.\n\nThe patients, who ranged in age from 14 to 31, were treated with drugs and hormones that prompted the body to produce hematopoietic stem cells and send them from the bone marrow into the bloodstream, where they were extracted by a special machine.\n\nAbout two weeks later, the patients checked into the hospital and received chemotherapy and other drugs to kill off their immune systems over five days.\n\nAfter a day of rest, they were infused with their own hematopoietic stem cells, which took about eight to 12 days to establish a new immune system. In the interim, they were given antibiotics to protect against infections.\n\nThe treatment had no effect on one patient, whose disease had already progressed too far, doctors decided. Of the remaining 14 patients, 12 were able to stop taking insulin shortly after their transplants. Altogether, five patients have not needed insulin injections for at least 23 months, and two have been insulin-free for more than 18 months.\n\nEven if patients continue to require insulin shots, the treatment should be considered a success if it halts the destruction of beta cells, said Dr. Jay Skyler, with the Diabetes Research Institute at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story states the new treatment is not without risks and that patients are prone to infection.\u00a0 However, there is no description of how severe this harm might be (could lead to death) or how frequently these occurred in the study.\u00a0 So, although harms are briefly mentioned, they are not adequately developed or appreciated.

At a week old, doctors amputated his dead forearm and hand. They were afraid his body would be become infected and he would die. Falardeau mourned her boy's missing arm for years but, in time, embraced her son as he was.\n\nWyatt also learned to adapt. They tried a couple of prosthetics when he was younger and each time the toddler abandoned the false limb within months.\n\n\"His main interest was to create a shocking response from onlookers by pulling it off in the grocery store,\" Falardeau wrote on CNN iReport . In truth, she had been more concerned about getting him therapy for his autism-related delays -- the limb difference was secondary.\n\nSo when a friend shared a story from the \"Today Show\" with Wyatt in mind, about a team of University of Central Florida (UCF) students and graduates that made an electronic arm for 6-year-old Pring using a three-dimensional printer on campus, Falardeau was defensive.\n\n\"He doesn't need this,\" she thought.\n\nHer fifth-grader had a different reaction: \"I want one of these robot arms!\" Falardeau remembers Wyatt telling her and her husband. \"I could ride a bike! I might even be able to paddle a kayak!\"\n\nThere were other things the 12-year-old boy said he would do if he had two hands. A proper somersault. Clap with two hands. Dance with a pretty girl with one hand on her back and the other leading. Stuff she hadn't really thought about but he clearly had.\n\nFalardeau got in touch with the Orlando students through E-Nable , an online volunteer organization started by Rochester Institute of Technology research scientist Jon Schull to match people who have 3-D printers with children in need of hands and arms. The organization creates and shares bionic arm designs for free download at EnablingTheFuture.org that can be assembled for as little as $20 to $50. Middle and high school student groups and Girl and Boy Scout troops are among those donating their time and materials to assemble limbs for kids and give them to recipients for free.\n\n\"It's really just a step-by-step process of solving problems. The first problem we solved was: how do we make the hand move electronically? And then: how do we attach this arm to a child?\" said sophomore Tyler Petresky. \"It's just one problem after another we keep solving. That's what engineering is all about.\"\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about 1,500 babies in the United States are born with upper limb deformities each year. Comprehensive statistics aren't available for the number of children with amputations, such as Wyatt.\n\nThe UCF project started when Albert Manero, an engineering doctoral student, heard a story on the radio about one of the inventors of the 3-D printed hand. He got involved with E-Nable and met Alex, a local boy teased because of his missing arm, and set about designing a robotic replacement. They gave it to Alex for free.\n\nEach electronic limb takes about 30 to 50 hours to make and assemble. The students use the printer in the school's manufacturing lab and cover the cost of materials -- about $350 -- through donations.\n\nPetresky got involved with the design of Pring's hand because Manero knew he was good with electronics.\n\n\"He bribed me with some pulled pork sandwiches. I went over to his house and helped him out with electronics,\" he said. \"I found out he was working on an arm, and I thought that was the coolest thing in the world.\"\n\nEventually Manero moved to Germany for a Fulbright scholarship and left Petresky in charge of running the operations in Orlando.\n\nPetresky says they ask every family about the child's favorite color, superhero and interests, so the new limb can \"not just be a piece of plastic ... but be a part of them.\"\n\nAs they've designed the bionics, they've learned that kids don't necessarily want to blend in. Children have requested colorful designs inspired by superheroes, Disney's \"Frozen,\" and in Wyatt's case, the blue-skinned men from \"Blue Man Group.\" For Christmas, the group upgraded Alex's plain vanilla white arm to a new one resembling Optimus Prime from \"Transformers.\"\n\n\"We quickly found out this is much less about fitting in and feeling normal, and much more about expressing yourself,\" Petresky said. \"There's a large aspect of being artistic and being creative.\"\n\nThe team has made electronic arms for five children and are working with three more kids including Wyatt. He traveled with his mom to UCF last week and practiced flexing his muscle to make the hand open and close.\n\nHe expects to get fitted with his new arm later this month.\n\nHis mom, Cynthia, was most excited about seeing Wyatt being celebrated for who he is.\n\n\"The adoration of college students was an affirmation that money can't buy. He was wrapped in the joy of leading and advising students on how to help children like himself,\" she wrote in her iReport. \"Wyatt felt like he was making a difference for himself and other children.\"\n\nAs they got ready to leave the campus, her son told her he can't wait to see what he will accomplish with his new arm.

And the risk of severe ROP seemed to be reduced by 90 percent, the researchers added.\n\n\"Human milk feeding potentially plays a strong role in protecting very preterm newborns from any-stage ROP and severe ROP,\" the international team of study authors wrote.\n\nRetinopathy of prematurity causes blood vessels to grow in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue in the back of the eye. When the vessels grow, they can cause the retina to detach, destroying vision, according to the U.S. National Eye Institute.\n\nFor the study, researchers from China, Canada and the United Kingdom reanalyzed the results of five published studies on ROP. The studies included more than 2,200 preterm infants, comparing how often babies had been fed human milk or formula, and whether or not they developed ROP.\n\nHowever, the new analysis only showed an association between breast milk and a reduced risk of ROP. It did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship due to the study's design.\n\nResults of the study were published online Nov. 16 in Pediatrics.\n\nExtremely preterm babies are most at risk of ROP. In the United States, 59 percent of babies born at 22 to 28 weeks have the disorder, said study researcher Dr. Chao Chen, a neonatologist at Children's Hospital of Fudan University, in Shanghai. He added that in China, a previous study showed the incidence of ROP was 50 percent in infants with a birth weight under 1,000 grams (2.2 pounds).\n\nROP \"has become a leading cause of childhood blindness in recent time,\" Chen said. \"In general, there are more ROP cases in developed countries, but more severe cases and higher rates of blindness in developing countries.\"\n\nThe greater incidence of ROP is likely due to the increasing survival rate of very preterm babies in developed countries, according to Chen. In developing countries, preterm babies are less likely to survive. When they do, the screening and treatments are not as good, Chen said, so blindness may be more likely.\n\nBabies in the studies had a range of gestational ages, from 26 to about 30 weeks. Their weights ranged from about 1.7 pounds to about 3 pounds. No information was given about how long the breast-feeding continued.\n\nIn re-evaluating the studies, Chen's team found that breast-feeding in any amount appeared to reduce the risk of ROP. And it appeared that the more breast milk, the better. Exclusive breast-feeding seemed to drop the odds of ROP by 75 percent compared to exclusive formula use. And any breast-feeding appeared to reduce the odds of the serious eye disease by 46 percent, the research showed.\n\nHow might human milk offer protection from the eye disorder? The antioxidants in human milk may help, Chen said. Human milk also has immune-protective properties, the researchers said. Breast-feeding also seems to help prevent two conditions known as sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis that may require oxygen therapy, which has also been linked to a higher risk of ROP, the study authors said.\n\nDr. Adolfo Llanos, a neonatologist at Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami, who was not involved with the new study, said the \"quality of this analysis is very good. It's reassuring to see the benefit we see with breast milk.\"\n\nHe said breast milk may help by reducing inflammation in the body. \"Preemies don't regulate inflammation in their bodies well,\" he said.\n\nLlanos cautioned that the study looked only at a mother's own breast milk, not donor milk, which can be used when the biological mother doesn't have enough of her own breast milk.\n\nThe takeaway from this study, Llanos said, is to breast-feed as long as possible, if possible.\n\nTo learn more about breast-feeding, visit American Academy of Pediatrics.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "In the framework of our criteria, the intervention in this study is the feeding\u00a0of human milk.

Although smoking rates in the United States have declined in recent decades, tens of millions of adults continue to smoke, and the habit causes more than 440,000 deaths a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAn effective vaccine could play a major role in reducing smoking around the world, said Dr. Vocci, who estimated that current rates of smoking would lead to one billion deaths in the 21st century.\n\nSurveys show that about 7 in 10 smokers say they would like to quit, but a vast majority of those who try end up relapsing. While the market for smoking cessation therapies is estimated to be more than $1 billion annually, many smokers continue to fail in their efforts to quit even while using the available products, with long-term success rates generally peaking at about 20 percent.\n\n\"It's the period between four-week abstinence and one-year abstinence that's the critical period,\" said Dr. Victor I. Reus, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, and a lead investigator on the NicVax study.\n\nIf the vaccine helps smokers quit, Dr. Reus said, a central question will be whether booster shots could help prevent relapse.\n\nThe classic nicotine buzz occurs when the molecule travels in the bloodstream across the \"blood-brain barrier\" to reach specific receptors in the brain. Nicotine itself does not cause the body to create antibodies as part of an immunological response, the way disease-causing viruses and bacteria do.\n\nThe anti-nicotine antibodies generated by NicVax are proteins that bind to the nicotine molecule. Because the compound is too big to cross the blood-brain barrier, the vaccine is expected to diminish or eliminate the pleasure associated with puffing a cigarette. This lack of positive physiological reinforcement for smoking is believed to reduce the nicotine craving that causes smokers to fail in their efforts to quit.\n\nThe most widespread therapies currently available are nicotine-replacement products, like nicotine patches and gum, which are designed to wean the smoker by administering trickles of nicotine to the body, replacing the surges delivered by cigarettes.\n\nZyban, a repackaging of the antidepressant Wellbutrin, was approved by the F.D.A. a decade ago for smoking cessation.

The studies also varied in quality, with only nine of 26 considered \"low [in] bias,\" according to background information accompanying the study.\n\nIn all evaluations, patients were randomly assigned to SMT or another comparison treatment, including active treatments such as exercise or inactive placebo treatments.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the studies were not included in a previous review published in 2004, and all patients had suffered from lower back pain for 12 weeks or longer.\n\nWhile chiropractors often perform SMT on patients, it is also administered by physical therapists and osteopaths.

But you may not want to start a raucous celebration just yet. The beer was effective only if it was nonalcoholic.\n\nRunning a marathon is, of course, punishing to the body, causing muscle soreness and inflammation. Grueling exercise can also weaken the immune system, making athletes susceptible to colds and other ills in the weeks after the event. Some athletes, particularly in Europe, long had downed nonalcoholic beer during hard training, claiming that it helped them to recover, but no science existed to support the practice.\n\nTo study the matter, researchers at the Technical University of Munich approached healthy male runners, most in their early 40s, who were training for the Munich Marathon, and asked if they would \u2014 in the name of science \u2014 be willing to drink a considerable amount of beer. Two hundred seventy-seven men agreed, even when told that the beverage would be nonalcoholic. Only half of the group received the alcohol-free beer, however; the other half got a similarly flavored placebo. No one knew who was drinking what.\n\nAll of the runners downed a liter to a liter and a half \u2014 about two to three pints \u2014 of their assigned beverage every day, beginning three weeks before the race and continuing for two weeks afterward. The scientists, meanwhile, collected blood samples from the men several weeks before the race, as well as immediately before to the start, at the finish line and on select days afterward. (These were an exceptionally obliging group of racers, it seems.) They monitored levels of various markers of inflammation in the men\u2019s blood, to see whether beer helped to blunt some of the immediate damage from running.\n\nFor the next two weeks, the men continued to dutifully swallow their nonalcoholic beer or other brew. They also reported any symptoms of colds or other upper respiratory ailments that developed during that time.\n\nThe men drinking the nonalcoholic beer reported far fewer illnesses than the runners swallowing the placebo beverage. \u201cIncidence of upper respiratory tract infections was 3.25-fold lower\u201d in the nonalcoholic beer drinkers, the scientists reported, in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. They also showed significantly less evidence of inflammation, as measured by various markers in their blood, and lower counts of white blood cells than the placebo group, an indication of overall better immune system health.\n\nThese effects matter, said Dr. Johannes Scherr, lead author of the study, because if a marathon runner\u2019s body is less sore and inflamed after a race, and he doesn\u2019t develop the sniffles, he can recover and return to training more quickly than he otherwise might have been able to. \u201cIt can be speculated that the training frequency could be higher (with shorter breaks after vigorous training sessions)\u201d in those drinking beer, he wrote in an e-mail response.\n\nJust how nonalcoholic beer eases the ravages of strenuous marathon training and racing is still being investigated. But, said Dr. Scherr, it almost certainly involves the beverage\u2019s rich bouquet of polyphenols, chemical substances found in many plants that, among other things, \u201csuppress viral replication\u201d and \u201cinfluence the innate immune system positively,\u201d all beneficial for fighting off a cold.\n\nAlcoholic beer happens to be drenched in polyphenols, too \u2014 \u201ceven more than nonalcoholic beer,\u201d Dr. Scherr said \u2014 but has the signal disadvantage of being alcoholic. \u201cWe do not know whether the side effects of alcoholic beer would cancel out the positive effects caused by the polyphenols,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFurthermore, it is not possible to drink one to one and a half liters of alcoholic beer per day, especially not during strenuous training.\u201d We all knew that, right?\n\nOf course, other substances containing polyphenols have shown early promise, and then underperformed in follow-up studies. Quercetin, for instance, a polyphenol derived principally from apple skins, was widely touted by endurance athletes several years ago after studies found that large doses allowed untrained lab mice to run for far longer than untreated animals. But the supplement has largely failed to show benefits in human athletes. An analysis of 10 human studies of the supplement presented at the American College of Sports Medicine annual meeting in June concluded that quercetin supplementation \u201cis very unlikely to provide an endurance performance advantage.\u201d\n\nBut the beer experiment did not begin by looking at mice. It began with human marathoners completing a punishing, unsimulated race, and showed demonstrable benefits, in terms of minimizing postrace damage.\n\nAll of which is good news as the fall marathon season approaches. Asked if he would recommend that serious marathon runners add nonalcoholic beer to their diets, Dr. Scherr said, \u201cWhen I look at the results of our study, I would have to answer \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible to get large amounts of polyphenols from other foods, he added, like those training-table staples chokeberries and mangosteens, as well as pomegranates and grapes. \u201cBut with these foods you do not consume the minerals, fluid and carbohydrates,\u201d he said, \u201cso nonalcoholic beer seems to be optimal\u201d for everything, perhaps, apart from your well-deserved celebratory carouse after the race.

High-risk tumors are more aggressive and thus more likely to eventually kill the patient.\n\nOf the blood thinners used in the study, aspirin was the one which seemed to account for most of the benefit, the researchers said\n\nThere has already been some evidence that cancer and the body's coagulation system might be linked in some way.\n\n\"Cancer patients tend to develop clots in their legs and lungs more frequently and also patients who develop clots in their legs and lungs tend to develop cancer more frequently,\" Choe noted. \"We hypothesized that anticoagulant medication may lower the chance of death from prostate cancer in men who have localized prostate cancer.\"\n\nAnd, at least according to this retrospective review of medical records, this did indeed appear to be the case. Retrospective studies -- where researchers look back over previously collected data, looking for associations -- are not as reliable as prospective trials, however.\n\nThe study included 5,275 men diagnosed with prostate cancer that had not yet spread beyond the prostate gland and had been treated with surgery or radiation. Of the almost 2,000 patients on anticoagulants in the study, 1,649 were taking aspirin, 428 warfarin, 287 clopidogrel (Plavix), 26 enoxaparin, and 408 a combination of blood thinners.\n\nAfter an average follow-up of about seven years, only 1 percent of men who had been taking an anticoagulant had died versus 4 percent of those in the control group. At 10 years, 4 percent of those taking one of these medications had died versus 10 percent in no-blood thinner group.\n\nThis translates to a risk reduction of about 50 percent, the researchers calculated.\n\nThe chances of the cancer spreading to the bone were reduced while PSA (prostate-specific antigen) blood levels -- thought to be a marker for cancer's advance -- were also better controlled.\n\n\"This benefit was seen whether these patients were treated with surgery or radiotherapy,\" Choe added.\n\nCancer cells are coated by platelets when they enter the bloodstream and are on their way to spreading. This protects them from immune cells and also helps them stick to their next location, Choe explained. Anticoagulants may work by interfering with this process.\n\nBut Choe said he is not ready to recommend routine aspirin use in men diagnosed with prostate cancer.\n\n\"It's premature to say that aspirin should be used in a standard-therapy way in all patients with prostate cancer,\" he said. \"But we may expect to see this benefit in those who are taking aspirin for other [usually cardiovascular] reasons.\"\n\nAspirin also comes with some risks of its own, including stomach bleeding, Choe pointed out.\n\nA second study, conducted in the United States, Canada and Great Britain and also being presented at ASTRO, suggests that a combination of hormone therapy plus radiation may be the best treatment for men who have locally advanced prostate cancer with a high risk of returning.\n\nThis usurps the previous view that hormone therapy was useless or even \"unkind or toxic,\" said study lead author Dr. Malcolm Mason, a radiation oncologist with Cardiff University in Wales.\n\nThis trial, the largest of its kind, involved about 1,200 men who were randomly chosen to receive hormone therapy alone or a combination of that and radiation.\n\nAn initial review at six years suggested that those taking the combination therapy had a 43 percent reduced risk of dying from prostate cancer, while side effects were not \"major,\" Mason said. \"If the figures from the interim analysis are similar to the final analysis, we would expect a 43 percent reduction in the chances of death from prostate cancer in men with this regimen,\" he said.\n\n\"We feel these results are practice changing,\" Mason added. \"The standard treatment for localized, high-risk prostate cancer for people who are fit for radiotherapy should be a combination of hormone therapy plus radiotherapy.\"\n\nExperts note that studies presented at scientific meetings do not face the same peer-review scrutiny as those published in reputable journals.\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on prostate cancer.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "\n\n\nThe story does mention that aspirin comes with risks, including stomach bleeding, so it might barely meet this criterion.

The results are published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nWhile most breast cancer is diagnosed at later ages, about 6% of women learn that they're ill before age 40 - when they are still of childbearing age. Breast cancer treatments that have shown the best results for for disease free survival include chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or both. For younger women still hoping for children, these treatments can cause devastating short-term or long-term loss of menstrual periods, and loss of fertility. While many women choose to preserve the option of having children by storing eggs before cancer treatment, the process can be costly and difficult.\n\nItalian researchers conducted a phase three study that included 281 women with breast cancer, aged 18 to 45 years and who had not experienced menopause.

The new vaccine offers significantly greater protection than the current vaccine, which protects against only two cancer causing types of HPV.\n\nA pivotal international clinical trial compared the safety and efficacy of the new vaccine, Gardasil 9, with the current vaccine, Gardasil, in more than 14,200 women aged between 16 and 26 years old. The findings indicate that if uninfected populations are vaccinated with Gardasil 9, approximately 90 per cent of all cervical cancers worldwide could be prevented.\n\nPublished in the New England Journal of Medicine, the study found that, among uninfected women, Gardasil 9 was 97 per cent effective at preventing high-grade cervical, vulvar and vaginal disease caused by HPV 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58, and was equally effective as the current Gardasil vaccine in preventing diseases caused by HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18.\n\nProfessor Jack Cuzick of Queen Mary University of London, who co-authored the report and participated in the design and analysis of the study, and served on the Trial Advisory Board, comments: \"This is a significant achievement. The new vaccine, Gardasil 9, is not only safe but will offer greatly improved protection against cervical and other cancers. Eventually this will mean less screening is needed, as women will have greater protection from the outset.\n\n\"Gardasil 9 offers the potential to increase overall cervical cancer prevention from 70 to 90 per cent, nearly eliminating this cancer among vaccinated women. However, it's crucial to remember that vaccination must be done before exposure to the virus. Our focus for prevention must be on girls aged 12-13, as the current UK vaccine programme is doing, but the vaccine may also be appropriate for women 25-45 as part of a screening appointment.\"\n\nUntil late last year, there were two available vaccines to protect against HPV related disease (Cervarix and Gardasil). The UK currently uses Gardasil which protects against four HPV types and offers about 70 per cent protection against cervical cancer, and also significantly reduces the risk of other types of cancer and genital warts.\n\nHowever, researchers have been trying to find methods to completely eliminate cervical cancer and other HPV related disease and by adding five more cancer related HPV types. The development of the new Gardasil 9 vaccine makes an important step in that direction.\n\nHPV is the most common sexually transmitted virus. Many people infected with HPV clear it from their systems with no lasting health concerns and some types of the virus are low risk, causing warts or verrucas. However, other types are high risk, causing cervical cancer (and less commonly vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, and throat cancers). Almost all cases of cervical cancer occur as a result of infection with high risk types of HPV.\n\nCervical cancer is still the fourth most common cancer in women, with over 500,000 cases and 250,000 deaths per year worldwide. In the UK around 3,000 women a year are diagnosed with cervical cancer and in 2011 there were around 970 deaths.\n\nIn the UK, all girls aged 12 to 13 are offered HPV vaccination as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme.\n\nProfessor Jack Cuzick concludes: \"Following these important findings, this vaccine has been licenced in the USA and approval is currently being sought in the UK and other countries.

Participants in the trial received two doses of the vaccine, with the doses given two months apart.\n\nLead researcher Professor Tony Cunningham from the Westmead Institute for Medical Research said the study shows that the vaccine stimulates production of a specific immune memory cell (CD4 T cells), generating a strong and sustained protection against the virus.\n\n\"The body has two types of immunity: protein antibodies and white blood cells known as T cells. As the virus circulates around the body, antibodies block it from entering cells. But when the virus does get into cells your T cells try to kill those infected cells.\n\n\"Our research shows that the vaccine stimulates your immune system to produce more antibodies and it generates a 24-fold increase in T cells. This is 12 times higher than other less effective shingles vaccines.\n\nThe research, published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, shows that Shingrix offers protection for up to four years, but Professor Cunningham believes it will last much longer.\n\n\"The second dose of the vaccine is important to ensure long-term protection,\" Professor Cunningham said.\n\n\"The efficacy is approximately 90% for all age groups--even for those over 70 years of age.\n\n\"This is quite remarkable because there are no other vaccines that perform nearly so well for people in their 70s and their 80s. We are seeing results comparable to those of childhood vaccinations.\n\n\"What's particularly exciting, though, is that 90% of recipients had an increased immune response sustained across the 3-year duration of the study.\n\n\"We anticipate that this protection will actually last much, much longer. We are now measuring the efficacy of the vaccine over the next 10 years and are very optimistic about the results,\" he said.\n\nShingrix is different from most other vaccines. Many vaccines are made from a weakened form of the virus, but Shingrix is made from just a single protein--known as glycoprotein E--that comes from the outer shell of the herpes zoster virus.\n\nThe vaccine also contains an adjuvant--a substance that helps your body fight off the virus. It is the first shingles vaccine to combine a non-live antigen with a specifically designed adjuvant.\n\nShingles is a viral infection, caused by the herpes zoster virus--the same virus that causes chickenpox. The incidence of shingles increases as we get older, because the body's natural immunity declines.\n\n\"When people reach their 50s and 60s, T cell immunity declines allowing shingles to strike. That's why our adult vaccine is directed specifically at T cell immunity,\" Professor Cunningham said.\n\nMost Australian adults have been infected with the herpes zoster virus and are at risk of shingles, even if they do not remember having chicken pox. By age 85, approximately 50% of the population will develop shingles.

In 2013, about 2.8 million TBI-related emergency department visits, hospitalizations and deaths occurred in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of these are what are called mild traumatic brain injuries, or mTBIs \u2014 head injuries that don't cause a coma. People with an mTBI typically get better within a few weeks, but for as many as 20 percent, problems can linger for months or years.\n\nMany of these patients find themselves stuck with depression, cognitive problems, headaches, fatigue and other symptoms. Known as post-concussion syndrome, this phenomenon is often difficult to treat. Antidepressants can lift moods, painkillers can ease headaches and physical therapy may ease dizziness, but most researchers agree that these remedies don't heal the injury within the brain.\n\nCould oxygen do the trick? A growing group of scientists and physicians say that hyperbaric treatment, which exposes patients to pure oxygen at higher-than-normal air pressure, may work.\n\n\"These patients don't have enough oxygen to heal the injured parts of their brains,\" said Shai Efrati, a researcher and physician at Tel Aviv University in Israel and a leading hyperbaric scientist. \"Hyperbaric treatment massively increases the amount of oxygen available to the brain.\"\n\nBut other researchers believe that the treatment has no merit and should not be recommended.\n\n\"People want to believe that hyperbaric can fix [brain injuries], and it can't,\" said David Cifu, a researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, who has spent much of his career treating veterans with brain injuries.\n\nCompressed air has been used by doctors since the 17th century. In 1917, two German inventors first used pressurized pure oxygen to treat decompression sickness, which occurs when undersea divers return to the surface too quickly. For the past 50 years, hyperbaric therapy has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for non-healing wounds, carbon monoxide poisoning, burns and decompression sickness. Over the past decade, doctors in the United States and internationally have begun using it to treat mTBIs.\n\nMTBIs include sports-related concussions and head injuries caused by traffic accidents. Also, between 2000 and 2017, 308,853 American service members suffered mild traumatic brain injuries, according to the Department of Defense.\n\nPatients with an mTBI typically experience symptoms that include headache, dizziness, fatigue, depression, anxiety and cognitive impairment. Known as post-concussion syndrome (PCS), this phenomenon is difficult to treat. Doctors use antidepressants, pain medications, biofeedback and physical therapy, but these strategies do not always work.\n\nThe nature of the human brain makes it particularly susceptible to chronic injury. The organ requires large amounts of energy under normal circumstances, and even more to heal when injured. And often, the initial trauma damages blood vessels that supply the brain with oxygen. So, just as the brain needs extra resources, it faces an energy crisis. Often, Efrati and others say, injured brain cells don't die, but may persist for years or decades, alive but hobbled. Hyperbaric therapy, he said, can return them to full function, even years after the injury.\n\n\"Oxygen is different, because it has a direct biological effect on brain tissue,\" said Paul G. Harch, a physician in New Orleans who over the past three decades has used hyperbaric oxygen to treat hundreds of people with chronic brain injury as well as stroke.\n\nPatients typically receive between 40 and 60 hour-long hyperbaric treatments spread over two to three months. During each treatment, they sit or lie inside a hyperbaric chamber, which varies in size from a person-size tube to a large room that can hold several patients. While in the chamber, patients breathe in pure oxygen, typically pressurized to about twice the density of sea-level air; in this environment, the lungs take in about 10 times as much oxygen as under normal conditions.\n\nResearchers say it remains unclear how hyperbaric oxygen affects injured brains. Efrati and others argue that it probably works through several biological pathways. The extra oxygen appears to trigger the healing of brain cells, and switches on genes specifically related to brain repair. It increases the number of stem cells that migrate to sites of brain injury, promotes the growth of new blood vessels in the brain, and boosts the activity of mitochondria, which provide energy to cells throughout the body. Scientists have linked increased mitochondrial activity to healing in many kinds of tissue.\n\nEfrati said the brain is no different from any other part of the body. Pressurized oxygen has the power to repair many kinds of tissue damage. \"A non-healing wound in the leg and a non-healing wound in the brain,\" he said, \"they are the same basic thing.\"\n\nEfrati came to the field accidentally. Eight years ago, as director of research at Assaf Harofeh Medical Center in Tel Aviv, he was asked to oversee the hospital's small hyperbaric chamber. He knew little about hyperbaric medicine and wasn't especially interested in it. But he soon noticed that pressurized oxygen seemed to have an unexpected effect. A patient had come for treatment of foot wounds that wouldn't heal \u2014 a common symptom in diabetes. The man had also suffered a traumatic brain injury several years earlier, which left him unable to speak more than a few words. The hyperbaric treatment healed his feet \u2014 and also revived his ability to speak. Other patients with wounds and brain injuries had similar surprising results. He began to examine how hyperbaric treatment affects the brain, and this work has become his focus. In 2008. Efrati founded and now directs the Sagol Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and Research at Tel Aviv University and Assaf Harofeh, where he oversees and collaborates with a range of scientists and manages a large hyperbaric treatment facility.\n\nAs the use of hyperbaric therapy for brain injury has grown, it has become increasingly controversial. Critics argue that it remains unproven and that desperate patients are wasting thousands of dollars \u2014 the treatment typically costs between $200 and $400 per session and is rarely covered by insurance \u2014 on a technique that rarely if ever helps. Between 2009 and 2015, Cifu oversaw three studies for the Department of Veterans Affairs \u2014 reportedly at a taxpayer cost of about $70 million \u2014 of about 60 active-duty service members with post-concussion syndrome. The studies found that hyperbaric treatment had little effect on their symptoms.\n\nOverall, there is relatively little research on hyperbaric treatment for brain injury, in part because pressurized oxygen can't be patented, which limits its potential profitability. \"It's very difficult to get funding for studies on this topic,\" Harch said.\n\nA few studies besides Cifu's have looked at humans. In a paper published in October, Efrati and colleagues examined 15 post-concussion syndrome patients who had received hyperbaric treatment. Using brain imaging, the scientists found that after treatment, the subjects had increased cerebral blood flow as well as more activity in brain areas that had previously been dormant. They say that this indicates that hyperbaric treatment triggered regeneration of nerve fibers and blood vessels in the brain. In addition, tests showed that the subjects had improved memory and processing speed. In another study, published in 2015, researchers gave hyperbaric oxygen to 56 patients with prolonged post-concussion syndrome. They found that many patients showed significant improvements in cognitive function and overall quality of life.\n\nWhile the research remains inconclusive, some American doctors are using oxygen to treat chronic brain injuries.\n\nZiad Mirza is one of them. For most of his career, he dispensed hyperbaric treatment for hospitals around Baltimore. Two years ago, he became chief medical officer for Hyperheal Hyperbarics, a company with three clinics in the Baltimore area. Since then, he said, he has treated about a half-dozen brain-injury patients, with mostly positive results.\n\nOne of these patients is Parisa Cook, 29, who in 2016 was found to have a tennis ball-size tumor in her brain. Surgeons removed it, but the operation was not a complete success. Cook, who lives in Baltimore, began to suffer from debilitating symptoms: She had problems with her short-term memory; she had constant headaches and couldn't concentrate; her vision became blurry and dark; and her hearing was altered, so that all sounds were jumbled and very loud. Specialists told her the operation probably had caused collateral brain trauma.\n\nOver the course of a year, she went to eight doctors and tried more than a dozen medications and a variety of other treatments. Nothing helped. A policy analyst for the Maryland Department of Health, she worried that she would have to quit her job. She began to consider suicide. \"I felt completely hopeless,\" she said.\n\nThen Cook read about hyperbaric oxygen treatment. She got in touch with Mirza and began treatments. After a single session, she said, her vision was no longer wobbly; after 20 sessions over a month, she felt \"perfect.\" \"It was a complete 180,\" she said. \"This treatment saved my life.\"\n\nCook's primary-care doctor, Sujay Pathak, an internist in Baltimore, first saw her in February. \"Her life was totally interrupted by this. She couldn't function,\" Pathak said.\n\nBut a few weeks after starting hyperbaric therapy in September, she \"got suddenly and rather miraculously better,\" Pathak said.\n\nOf course, such anecdotes are not the same as rigorous scientific research. Efrati agreed that hyperbaric treatment requires more research. \"Definitely, we need more science,\" he said. \"We have a lot to learn. But we are seeing the results with our patients. It works, again and again and again.\"\n\nHyperbaric wound treatment, often for diabetics, is booming.

But finding a remedy for back pain can be a lot like a guessing game.\n\nHe says it was only through Alexander Technique lessons that he trained his body to move in a way that eased his aching back.

Previous research involved administering the combination by injection or via a patch, said study senior author Dr. Christina Wang, a professor of medicine at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute.\n\nThe combination contraceptive needs to undergo further testing before it is commercially available.\n\nAlthough men have sometimes received a bad rap for not being willing to assume responsibility for birth control, Dr. Joseph Alukal, an assistant professor of urology at NYU Langone Medical Center, in New York City, thinks this reputation may be somewhat undeserved.\n\n\"I think [men] would use it more than is realized,\" said Alukal, who was not involved in the new research. \"Plenty of guys are concerned about unwanted pregnancy, almost as much as women.\"\n\nUnfortunately, condoms and vasectomy have remained the only commercially available contraception options for men.\n\nThe results of the study, funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development, were presented at the recent Endocrine Society annual meeting, held in Houston.\n\nAccording to Wang, the gel was applied in two spots -- the testosterone component on the arm and the progestin component on the abdomen. The gels were applied every day for six months.\n\nThe study, conducted in conjunction with the University of Washington, involved 56 men who were assigned to receive one of three types of gels: one gel containing both testosterone plus a gel containing one of two doses of the synthetic progestin; or a gel containing testosterone on its own plus a \"placebo\" gel with no progestin.\n\nUp to 89 percent of the men who received the combination formulas saw their sperm concentrations plunge to less than 1 million sperm per milliliter, versus just 23 percent of those receiving only testosterone.\n\nNormal sperm concentration is more than 15 million sperm per milliliter, according to the Mayo Clinic's website.\n\nUp to 78 percent of men receiving the drug combination in the study saw their concentrations drop to no sperm at all, versus only 23 percent of men taking testosterone alone.\n\nThe testosterone/progestin combination works by shutting off the hormones that control production of sperm in the testes, Wang explained.\n\nOne important and unanswered question is what the long-term side effects of this regimen might be.\n\nThe answer, said Wang, is \"We just don't know.\"\n\nThat's apart from mild-to-moderate acne or an increase in acne, which was seen in about 21 percent of participants.\n\nA new formulation currently being developed that contains half the amount of testosterone might decrease or eliminate that problem, Wang speculated.\n\nAnother question is how reversible this would be in terms of restoring sperm counts, Alukal said.\n\nIn addition to planning more studies on this combination protocol, Wang is also in early phases of testing the male hormone dimethandrolone, which is more potent than testosterone.\n\nBecause the new study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nThere's more on contraception at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story mentions acne as one of the problems seen with men taking the hormone gel, adding that we \u201cjust don\u2019t know\u201d what the long-term side effects might be.\nWhile this comes close to meeting the standard, there are actually quite a few other known risks (some quite serious) associated with the administration of testosterone, which is one of the two hormones contained in the test gel.

And lab experiments have shown that estrogen may inhibit tumor development in the colon by affecting cell growth, or by lowering levels of a cancer-linked hormone called IGF-1.\n\nHowever, no one is recommending that women take HRT to ward off colon cancer. Millions of women stopped using the hormones after a large U.S. government study in 2002 found that postmenopausal women given HRT had higher risks of heart attack, stroke, breast cancer and blood clots than women given an inactive placebo.\n\nAs a result, experts now advise that while HRT is effective at relieving menopausal symptoms \u2014 like hot flashes and vaginal dryness \u2014 women should take it at the lowest dose and for the shortest time possible.\n\nThese latest findings do not alter that advice.

Among these women, HRT use was linked to a 55 percent lower risk of the disease versus non-use.\n\nThe implications of that finding, if any, are not yet clear.\n\nFamily history of colon cancer is an established risk factor for the disease, but only one study, according to Henderson\u2019s team, has looked at whether family history affects the link between HRT and colon cancer risk \u2014 and it found no evidence that it did.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story did state, \"a large U.S. government study in 2002 found that postmenopausal women given HRT had higher risks of heart attack, stroke, breast cancer and blood clots than women given an inactive placebo.\"\u00a0 And we think that\u2019s sufficient in this case.

(\"Primary insomnia\" means that medical problems, medicines, or other substances have been ruled out as a cause of sleep difficulties. The more common type of insomnia is \"secondary insomnia,\" in which medical issues or medications contribute.)\n\nOf the patients with insomnia, the average age was 45 and nine were women. Participants slept for two nights in a sleep lab with no cap; two nights with the cap set at a \"neutral\" temperature (about 86 degrees Fahrenheit); two nights at a moderately cool temperature (72 degrees Fahrenheit); and two nights with the coolest temperature (57 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nWhile the participants slept, researchers monitored their brain electrical activity, eye movements (to determine if someone was in REM, or rapid eye movement sleep) and jaw muscle tone (during REM, the muscles go slack due to 'sleep paralysis').\n\nIn this preliminary study, about three-quarters of those with insomnia said the cap helped them sleep better when the water temperature was about 57 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nAt higher temperatures -- 72 and 86 degrees -- patients reported no benefit, according to the study presented Monday at SLEEP 2011, the Associated Professional Sleep Societies meeting in Minneapolis.\n\nWhile wearing the cooling cap, it took insomnia patients an average of 13 minutes to fall asleep and they spent 89 percent of their time in bed actually sleeping, about the same as controls who didn't have insomnia (the latter group averaged 16 minutes to fall asleep and 89 percent of the time in bed sleeping) .\n\nThe cooling cap was, however, associated with an increased amount of slow-wave sleep -- or the deepest, restorative portion of sleep, the researchers reported.\n\n\"What we wanted to find out was: 'Would cooling the surface of the brain of insomnia patients result in lower metabolism and improved sleep? The basic answer in this preliminary study, is yes, it seems to work, and it works in two ways,\" said Buysse. \"It does reduce brain metabolism in the frontal lobes, and it improves sleep.\"\n\nDr. William Kohler, medical director of the Florida Sleep Institute, said the concept was exciting and worth further research in larger studies that include body temperature measurements and brain imaging tests.\n\n\"The theoretical concept is correct, in that we do know from many previous studies that as the body core temperature cools, our sleep improves, and with warming of the core temperature, we have more restless sleep,\" Kohler said.\n\nChronic insomnia -- which the American Academy of Sleep Medicine attributes to about one out of every 10 Americans -- can be difficult to treat. Medications can help, although many people complain of side effects, Kohler said. The most effective treatment is cognitive behavior therapy, which involves changes such as avoiding cigarettes, alcohol and caffeine before bed, and getting plenty of bright light in the morning but turning off the TV, computer and dimming the lights during a wind-down period, among other techniques for improving \"sleep hygiene.\"\n\n\"It's in the brain where the chemical changes are occurring that lead to sleep,\" he said.\n\nThe cap is not yet available to consumers, although the lead researcher, Dr. Eric Nofzinger, has plans to bring it to market, Buysse said.\n\nBecause this study was extremely small and presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal and confirmed in larger studies.\n\nBuysee said there shouldn't be any safety issues.

Chan, PhD, Debbie and Andy Rachleff Distinguished Professor of Neurology, vice chief of the Division of Neuroinflammation and Glial Biology, and senior author of the new study. First approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1977 for allergies, the drug has been available over the counter in generic form since 1993.\n\nThe researchers said that the Phase II results, published online on 10 October, 2017 in The Lancet, are the first in which a drug has been shown to reliably restore any brain function damaged by a neurological disease in human patients.\n\n\"To the best of our knowledge this is the first time a therapy has been able to reverse deficits caused by MS. It's not a cure, but it's a first step towards restoring brain function to the millions who are affected by this chronic, debilitating disease,\" said the trial's principal investigator, Ari Green, MD, also Debbie and Andy Rachleff Distinguished Professor of Neurology, chief of the Division of Neuroinflammation and Glial Biology, and medical director of the UCSF Multiple Sclerosis and Neuroinflammation Center.\n\nChan and Green are co-directors of the UCSF Small-Molecule Program for Remyelination, and both are members of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences.\n\nThe new results are particularly notable, Chan said, because patients in the trial had suffered from MS symptoms caused by injury to myelin for years. \"People thought we were absolutely crazy to launch this trial, because they thought that only in newly diagnosed cases could a drug like this be effective -- intuitively, if myelin damage is new, the chance of repair is strong. In the patients in our trial the disease had gone on for years, but we still saw strong evidence of repair.\"\n\nMS is an autoimmune neurodegenerative disorder that affects nearly 2.5 million people worldwide. The disease strikes when the immune system attacks myelin, layers of fatty insulating membrane that surround nerve fibers. Unlike the rubber insulation around wires, however, myelin helps electrical signals in neurons move faster and more efficiently. As myelin damage continues over the course of the disease, neurons progressively lose their ability to reliably transmit electrical signals, resulting in progressive loss of vision, weakness, walking difficulties, and problems with coordination and balance.\n\nCurrent MS treatments aim to prevent the immune system from doing further harm, but none have been shown to repair damaged myelin. In both his 2013 research and in subsequent studies with a mouse model of MS, however, Chan and colleagues had demonstrated that clemastine fumarate promotes myelin regeneration and restores neural function, promising preclinical results that inspired the new study, known as the ReBUILD trial.\n\nBecause the visual system is often one of the first and most prominent parts of the brain to be affected in MS, and because there are well-established tools to measure the speed of neural transmission in the areas of the brain devoted to vision, the research team used a method known as visual evoked potentials, or VEPs, to assess clemastine's therapeutic effects in the trial.\n\nThe five-month Phase II trial enrolled 50 patients with relapsing but generally long-standing MS whose VEPs reflected preexisting deficits in neural transmission. The researchers showed flickering patterns on a screen to participants, and used electrodes placed over the brain's visual areas at the back of the head to gauge how long it took for the flickering signal presented to the eye to generate an electrical response that could be detected by the electrodes. The time from presentation of the pattern to the detection of the VEP is a measurement of how long it took for the signal to travel via nerve fibers from the retina, at the back of the eye, to the visual areas at the back of the brain.\n\nTo enhance the power of their study, the researchers used a \"crossover\" design: they divided the patient population in two and gave the drug, blinded to both participant and researcher, to one group, and a placebo to the other for 90 days; then they switched between the two groups, giving a placebo to the first group and the drug to the other for the next 60 days. This \"flip-flop\" technique gave the researchers the ability to compare patients to themselves -- a form of control that increased the statistical power of the study by nearly an order of magnitude, Green said.\n\nDuring the periods when each group was taking the drug, the neural signal from the eye to the back of the brain was significantly accelerated over the baseline measurements taken before the patients began the study. The effect persisted in the group that had switched to placebo, suggesting that durable repair of myelin had been induced by the drug.\n\nAlthough the research team could not directly observe evidence of rebuilding of myelin in trial participants using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Chan and Green said that this reflects a weakness of current MRI techniques as a tool for this purpose rather than evidence that myelin regeneration did not take place. \"We still don't have imaging methods that have been proven to be able to detect remyelination in humans,\" said Chan.\n\nThat myelin increases the speed of neural transmission is one of the most well-established concepts in neurobiology, and combined with the clear evidence from Chan's preclinical research showing that clemastine fumarate promotes myelin formation, myelin regeneration is the only plausible explanation for the VEP results, the authors said.\n\n\"This is the first step in a long process,\" Green said. \"By no means do we want to suggest that this is a cure-all. We want to ground-truth myelination metrics -- we're designing the crucible that's going to be used to test any future method for detecting remyelination.\"\n\nThe work was funded through generous support from the Rachleff Family.\n\nIn addition to Green and Chan, authors (all at UCSF) include Jeffrey M Gelfand, MD, MAS; Bruce A Cree, MD, PhD, MAS; Carolyn Bevan, MD; W.

Combining data from 20 clinical trials, which included over 1,000 patients with chronic insomnia, the authors calculated sleep improvements after C.B.T. treatment, relative to no treatment. On average, treated patients fell asleep almost 20 minutes faster and were awake in the night almost half an hour less. The total amount of time that they were sleeping when in bed increased by nearly 10 percent. These results are similar to or better than improvements from many sleep drugs, and lasted longer.\n\nMy experience is consistent with these averages. The C.B.T. treatment I received, through an online program recommended by my doctor, also included keeping careful track of how much sleep I got each night. This proved very helpful. It demonstrated progress \u2014 the nights in which I got only four or five hours of sleep became less common, and, on average, my nights of sleep lengthened by 30 minutes. My sleep log also helped me be more objective. Many nights I might have considered \u201cbad\u201d \u2014 and fretted over \u2014 were ones in which I got only one hour less sleep than my target of seven hours. Recognizing that\u2019s not really so bad helped me relax, and relaxing helped me get more and better sleep.\n\nImprovements like mine and those reported in the study bring sleep statistics for those with insomnia quite close to those without it. This further emphasizes the point that many insomniacs aren\u2019t that different from normal sleepers. Many sleep fine most nights, but also have more frequent nights of insufficient sleep than normal sleepers would experience. A big part of the difference may be how insomniacs perceive their sleep performance and the negative messages they give themselves about their poor sleep and how it will affect their daily lives.\n\nC.B.T. practitioners learn that if you label a night of sleep \u201cbad\u201d and expect a bad day to follow a bad night of sleep, you\u2019re more likely to get it, as well as more likely to be anxious the next time you attempt to sleep. In this way, unless exacerbated by physical causes \u2014 like sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome \u2014 insomnia is a condition of the mind that then infects the body. Like a patch on faulty software, C.B.T. reorients one\u2019s thinking and behavior so that sleep is first thought to be, and then soon after actually is, a more positive experience. Drugs, on the other hand, just treat insomniacs\u2019 symptoms without addressing the underlying cause, which is why the relief they provide may be less durable.\n\nFor me, and many patients, C.B.T. works.

She says she usually possesses a great lust for lust, but then her libido started dissipating a few years ago when she was in her late 40s.\n\nShocked and not quite sure what to do, she turned to medical doctors, and found there wasn't much they could offer, as there's no prescription medicine like Viagra to help a woman when her sex life gets stuck. The greatest hope for a so-called \"female Viagra\" was a drug called flibanserin, but it was nixed by a panel of Food and Drug Administration experts on Friday, who said the drug didn't seem to really help women with sexual dysfunction.\n\nThis was the second time a so-called \"female Viagra\" failed to make it on the market; in 2004, an FDA panel said no to Intrinsa, a testosterone patch meant to hormonally help women with a lack of desire for sex.\n\nGiven these two rejections, it could be a while before another pharmaceutical company decides to sink money into developing a new drug for women with sexual problems. One company, BioSante Pharmaceuticals, hopes to bring a testosterone gel to the market in 2012, but there aren't many other products on the horizon.\n\n\"There hasn't been much action in this area, and that certainly has to come up when a company is thinking about dumping money into researching a drug for female sexual dysfunction,\" says Phyllis Greenberger, president of the Society for Women's Health Research, which received money from Boehringer Ingelheim, the company that makes flibanserin.\n\nThat's despite a seeming need for such medication.

She says acupuncture, like Viagra, increases blood flow to the genitals, but unlike Viagra, it usually takes four to six weeks to see results.\n\n\"If your sexuality has been lying dormant for a while, then it's going to take a while to wake it up,\" Blakeway says. \"And when it does wake up, I tell women not to see this as goal-oriented orgasmic sex, but rather as a way of connecting to their partner.\"\n\nOne of Blakeway's patients wrote an article for the magazine, Cookie, about her experience with acupuncture for her flagging sex life.\n\nTo find an acupuncturist near you, go to the website of the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine and check off \"Chinese Herbology Certification.\"\n\nBlakeway says she often has success combining acupuncture with Chinese medicine.

Not long after, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.\n\n\"Fast forward now, and my entire right side is pretty much paralyzed and my left side is weakening,\" Stecker says.\n\nStecker is now confined to a wheelchair, from where he writes a blog about his disease, called Wheelchair Kamikaze.\n\nMore than a year ago, Stecker started writing about a theory Italian physician Paolo Zamboni proposed in 2008 called chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency, or CCSVI.\n\nIt's been thought that multiple sclerosis is caused by a misguided immune system that attacks the nerves of the brain and spinal cord and can lead to muscle weakness, paralysis and death. However, Zamboni suggests that the disease instead is the result of blocked blood veins \u2014 leading to inflammation, which, in turn, causes the immune system to attack nerves in the brain and spinal cord.\n\nZamboni proposed that treating it may be as simple as opening them up. Stecker was hopeful.\n\n\"Because my disease is so aggressive, I have been very willing to be equally aggressive in trying to combat it,\" Stecker says.\n\nTo clear the veins, his doctor tried opening them with a tiny balloon. Zamboni calls it \"the liberation procedure\" but it is actually a common technique known as angioplasty when it's used to open clogged arteries \u2014 not veins.\n\n\"At first, I was very skeptical. But anecdotal reports started coming through of almost miraculous results from it.\u2026So, I decided, you know, hey it was worth a shot,\" Stecker says.\n\nBut it didn't work. Although the doctor who treated him in New York found a significant blockage, he was unable to correct it, Stecker says.\n\nStill, some would say Stecker was lucky. Many desperate patients have spent their life savings flying overseas to have the procedure, only to have it fail a few months later. Others elect to have tiny metal tubes, known as \"stents,\" placed in the veins to hold them open and have suffered serious complications, including life-threatening blood clots. Several patients have even died as a result.\n\nStecker says if he had it to do over again, he would have waited for more research. But he says he was eager to try something that offered him the first real glimmer of hope for a cure.\n\n\"CCSVI equals hope and a lot of MS patients just are completely devoid of hope,\" Stecker says. \"People don't want to have MS. They want to go back to who they used to be. You know, along comes this theory that offers an easy-to-understand solution, so it's very, very, very seductive.\"\n\nIt's so seductive, in fact, that Canadians and Americans with MS have been flocking overseas to get the \"liberation procedure.\" Something that many researchers find very troubling. Robert Zivadinov of the Buffalo Neuroimaging Analysis Center in New York says that not only is the procedure unsafe and costly to many patients, it is impeding necessary research.\n\n\"Even if the treatment is not useful for patients with MS, I don't think that we can abandon the idea of vascular involvement in MS,\" Zivadinov says. \"And I think this merits very detailed understanding of what is going on.\"\n\nWhat is going on is still a bit of a mystery. Critics argue that although Zamboni's original research suggests a vascular cause for MS, other studies don't. These discrepancies, and growing public controversy, prompted the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in the U.S. and the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada to take Zamboni's claims seriously. They funded a number of independent studies to investigate the relationship between CCSVI and MS.\n\nRobert Fox, a neurologist at the Cleveland Clinic, currently oversees one of the studies funded by an MS Society grant. He says part of the confusion comes from variations in how CCSVI is measured.\n\n\"That's absolutely one of the potential problems in the previous studies: Are the techs who got negative results, did they just not know how to do the ultrasound in the way that Dr. Zamboni described doing the ultrasound? And that's a very important issue,\" Fox says.\n\nFox says he sent his technicians to a special training to learn how to properly measure the veins because it's not something most technicians ever do.\n\nMeanwhile in Buffalo, Zivadinov says his research on CCSVI already shows a clear picture emerging.\n\n\"CCSVI is not the cause of MS but might be a consequence or a contributing factor to progression, and I think that has to be studied,\" Zivadinov says.\n\nStudying how the vascular system is involved in neurologic disease is an entirely new concept, Zivadinov says. One that may have an impact beyond any single disease.\n\n\"What professor Zamboni discovered in terms of veins is something much bigger than multiple sclerosis,\" Zivadinov says. \"We need to understand the role of the venous system in the pathology of central nervous diseases and aging.\"\n\nZamboni himself says that even if it turns out he's wrong, coming to a greater understanding of the disease would be the big reward \u2014 both for him and thousands of MS patients.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story mentions life-threatening blood clots are a risk of the procedure, and notes that people have died from the surgery.

So, the researchers theorized that the poor performance of the supplements may simply reflect the overwhelming power of the medications.\n\nStudy author Daan Kromhout, from the division of human nutrition at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, is to present the findings Sunday at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Stockholm; the study will appear online in the New England Journal of Medicine simultaneously.\n\nIn the study, researchers focused on a group of more than 4,800 Dutch heart attack patients between the ages of 60 and 80, slightly more than three-quarters of whom were men.\n\nAll had experienced a heart attack at some point in the decade leading up to the study, and all were taking blood pressure medications, anti-clotting drugs and statins.\n\nAt the study's start, the patients were instructed to consume (over a period lasting a little over three years) one of four different types of margarines: one supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids; one supplemented with the plant-derived ALA; one supplemented with both omega-3 fatty acids and ALA; and one with no supplements.\n\nThe amount of supplementation added to the various margarines was deemed to be \"low-dose.\" During the study, the patients consumed an average of 18.8 grams of margarine per day, which meant ingestion of an average of 226 milligrams of EPA combined with 150 milligrams of DHA omega-3 fatty acids and/or 1.9 grams of ALA.\n\nBy the study's end, almost 14 percent of the heart attack patients had experienced another \"major cardiovascular event,\" with some cases ending in death.\n\nNone of the low-dose supplements seemed to stave off such events in most of the patients. One exception appeared to be among women ingesting ALA; researchers saw a 27 percent reduction in the risk for further cardiac complications, although that reduction did not quite reach statistical significance.\n\n\"The bottom-line finding of the Alpha Omega Trial is that [omega]-3 fatty acids did not reduce the primary endpoint major cardiovascular events,\" Kromhout said, noting that the ALA finding needs further confirmation.\n\nDr. Murray A. Mittleman, director of the cardiovascular epidemiology research unit at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said he was \"not that surprised by these results.\"\n\n\"Other studies have shown no benefit from omega-3, other than specifically protecting against cardiac death linked to arrhythmia among patients who have just survived a heart attack,\" Mittleman noted. It is during this acute post-attack period, he explained, when patients are most vulnerable to a subsequent event.\n\n\"But here, in some cases the patients they looked at are years following their first heart attack when they start taking these supplements,\" he stressed. \"So, that's a big difference in what kind of patient they're examining. And they're also not just looking at preventable fatalities but all heart-related events that follow. And on top of that, the supplement doses they use here are very low, much lower than those used in prior studies.\"\n\n\"So it might be big differences in study design that account for this new finding,\" Mittleman cautioned. \"In any case, I would say this is absolutely worth further investigation.\"\n\nDr. Gregg C. Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, agreed.\n\n\"It is possible that improvements in other treatments for heart attack patients have made fish oil supplementation less important for reducing cardiovascular risk,\" he acknowledged. \"But it's also possible that the different dosing used in this study relative to previous work made a difference in the outcome. The dosing here may have been just too low, whereas higher doses given immediately following an initial heart attack might have been protective.\"\n\n\"So I would say,\" Fonarow added, \"that this is by no means the final word regarding omega-3s and cardiovascular health.\"\n\nFor more on omega-3 fatty acids, visit the National Institutes of Health.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "\u00a0While mentioning that there didn\u2019t appear to be any benefit from the use of fortified margarine, the story neglected to report that there also didn\u2019t seem to be any overt harm from the used of the fortified margarine.

Now, two studies suggest that there is merit to that strategy.\n\nThe studies, published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine , compared opioid prescription patterns in states that have enacted medical cannabis laws with those that have not. One of the studies looked at opioid prescriptions covered by Medicare Part D between 2010 and 2015, while the other looked at opioid prescriptions covered by Medicaid between 2011 and 2016.\n\nThe researchers found that states that allow the use of cannabis for medical purposes had 2.21 million fewer daily doses of opioids prescribed per year under Medicare Part D, compared with those states without medical cannabis laws. Opioid prescriptions under Medicaid also dropped by 5.88% in states with medical cannabis laws compared with states without such laws, according to the studies.\n\n\"This study adds one more brick in the wall in the argument that cannabis clearly has medical applications,\" said David Bradford , professor of public administration and policy at the University of Georgia and a lead author of the Medicare study.\n\n\"And for pain patients in particular, our work adds to the argument that cannabis can be effective.\"\n\n\"Medicare and Medicaid publishes this data, and we're free to use it, and anyone who's interested can download the data,\" Bradford said. \"But that means that we don't know what's going on with the privately insured and the uninsured population, and for that, I'm afraid the data sets are proprietary and expensive.\"\n\n'This crisis is very real'\n\n\"We have had overuse of certain prescription opioids over the years, and it's certainly contributed to the opioid crisis that we're feeling,\" he added. \"I don't think that's the only reason, but certainly, it was too easy at many points to get prescriptions for opioids.\"\n\n\"All drugs of abuse operate using some shared pathways. For example, cannabinoid receptors and opioid receptors coincidentally happen to be located very close by in many places in the brain,\" Hill said. \"So it stands to reason that a medication that affects one system might affect the other.\"\n\nBut unlike opioids, marijuana has little addiction potential, and virtually no deaths from marijuana overdose have been reported in the United States, according to Bradford.\n\n\"No one has ever died of cannabis, so it has many safety advantages over opiates,\" Bradford said. \"And to the extent that we're trying to manage the opiate crisis, cannabis is a potential tool.\"\n\nComparing states with and without medical marijuana laws\n\nIn order to evaluate whether medical marijuana could function as an effective and safe alternative to opioids, the two teams of researchers looked at whether opioid prescriptions were lower in states that had active medical cannabis laws and whether those states that enacted these laws during the study period saw reductions in opioid prescriptions.\n\n\"We saw a 9% or 10% reduction (in opioid prescriptions) in Colorado and Oregon,\" Wen said. \"And in Alaska and Washington, the magnitude was a little bit smaller but still significant.\"\n\nThe first state in the United States to legalize marijuana for medicinal use was California, in 1996. Since then, 29 states and the District of Columbia have approved some form of legalized cannabis. All of these states include chronic pain -- either directly or indirectly -- in the list of approved medical conditions for marijuana use, according to Bradford.\n\nThe details of the medical cannabis laws were found to have a significant impact on opioid prescription patterns, the researchers found. States that permitted recreational use, for example, saw an additional 6.38% reduction in opioid prescriptions under Medicaid compared with those states that permitted marijuana only for medical use, according to Wen.\n\nThe method of procurement also had a significant impact on opioid prescription patterns. States that permitted medical dispensaries -- regulated shops that people can visit to purchase cannabis products -- had 3.742 million fewer opioid prescriptions filled per year under Medicare Part D, while those that allowed only home cultivation had 1.792 million fewer opioid prescriptions per year.\n\n\"We found that there was about a 14.5% reduction in any opiate use when dispensaries were turned on -- and that was statistically significant -- and about a 7% reduction in any opiate use when home cultivation only was turned on,\" Bradford said. \"So dispensaries are much more powerful in terms of shifting people away from the use of opiates.\"\n\nThe impact of these laws also differed based on the class of opioid prescribed. Specifically, states with medical cannabis laws saw 20.7% fewer morphine prescriptions and 17.4% fewer hydrocodone prescriptions compared with states that did not have these laws, according to Bradford.\n\n\"I know that many people, including the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, are skeptical of cannabis,\" Bradford said. \"But, you know, the attorney general needs to be terrified of fentanyl.\"\n\n\"As we have all of these states implementing these policies, it's imperative that we do more research,\" Hill said. \"We need to study the effects of these policies, and we really haven't done it to the degree that we should.\"\n\nThe two recent studies looked only at patients enrolled in Medicaid and Medicare Part D, meaning the results may not be generalizable to the entire US population.\n\nBut both Hill and Moore agree that as more states debate the merits of legalizing marijuana in the coming months and years, more research will be needed to create consistency between cannabis science and cannabis policy.\n\n\"There is a great deal of movement in the Northeast, with New Hampshire and New Jersey being well-positioned to legalize adult use,\" Moore said. \"I believe there are also ballot measures to legalize marijuana in Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota as well that voters will decide on in Fall 2018.\"\n\nHill called the new research \"a call to action\" and added, \"we should be studying these policies.

A viable vaccine to prevent and/or treat leprosy is the next step in the effort to bring this disease to an end.\n\nScientists at IDRI, along with national and international collaborators including the National Hansen's Disease Program and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, with financial support from American Leprosy Missions, have developed a promising leprosy vaccine candidate designed to help treat leprosy and prevent exposed individuals from developing disease and the resulting disabilities. Based on data generated in preclinical studies, the vaccine candidate, called LepVax, has progressed to Phase I clinical testing in the United States, the first stage of safety testing in human volunteers. The clinical trial is focused on safety, as well as evaluating the immune response to the vaccine.\n\n\"While previous attempts have used vaccines primarily developed for other diseases, this is the first totally defined vaccine candidate developed specifically for leprosy, using the latest technologies and offering no less than those exposed to leprosy deserve,\" said Steven Reed, Ph.D., IDRI President, CEO & Founder. \"The leprosy vaccine program at IDRI has benefited greatly from what we've learned in the development of tuberculosis vaccine candidates over the past two decades. Although the bacteria that cause tuberculosis and leprosy are related, leprosy vaccine development posed great challenges. This vaccine represents a unique accomplishment, requiring the most advanced technologies in molecular biology and immunology, and American Leprosy Missions has been there from the beginning.\" IDRI scientists have also developed two vaccine candidates for tuberculosis, both in clinical stages of development.\n\n\"We are thrilled that after 15 years and an investment of over $5.1 million, made possible by our faithful donors and partners, a leprosy-specific vaccine is beginning a Phase I clinical trial,\" says Bill Simmons, President and CEO of American Leprosy Missions. \"We believe this may be the most exciting breakthrough in leprosy treatment since multi-drug therapy, the current treatment for leprosy, was launched in the 1980s. We look forward to this vaccine improving the health outcomes of people diagnosed with leprosy. And, it may be that this vaccine can lead to interruption of the transmission of leprosy all together. What a tremendous legacy this would leave for millions of people worldwide.\"\n\nThe vaccine was developed through significant efforts in screening and identifying M. leprae proteins that trigger an effective immune response. IDRI scientists then produced a fusion of four leprosy proteins, which is combined with IDRI's proprietary immune-stimulating adjuvant (GLA-SE). With recent developments in vaccine technology, IDRI scientists can now induce protective responses even after infection, meaning it could be possible to prevent disease development in people already infected with the leprosy bacterium.\n\n\"This generation of a vaccine to prevent and possibly treat leprosy is the result of years of research. The development has been complicated by the fact that the organism that causes leprosy cannot be grown in culture in the laboratory,\" Reed explained. \"This is a unique example of a vaccine produced by totally synthetic methods.\"\n\nReed added that, without the foresight and support of American Leprosy Missions, there would be no leprosy vaccine candidate. \"The vision and support of American Leprosy Missions has been tremendous as we've worked with them throughout the years, moving from our work in developing a leprosy diagnostic to our current focus on a successful leprosy vaccine,\" he said. \"The progress we've had to date would not have been possible without American Leprosy Missions' financial support and guidance.\" Early results from the Phase I study should be available in 2018, and the partners are currently exploring mechanisms to advance the vaccine through later-phase clinical trials should results from the Phase I study (clinical trial NCT03302897) support further evaluation.\n\nThe vaccine candidate will serve as part of an overall strategy to end leprosy, which will require detection, prevention and treatment. IDRI had developed technology to enable a rapid, affordable, point-of-care diagnostic test, which was funded by NIAID (grant numbers 1R43AI066613-01A1 and 2R44AI066613-02.)\n\nIn addition to IDRI and American Leprosy Missions, a variety of partners are taking part in efforts to eliminate leprosy, including Novartis and the Novartis Foundation. Reed, along with scientists from a variety of scientific organizations recently published \"Innovative tools and approaches to end the transmission of Mycobacterium leprae\" in , outlining what is needed to achieve this goal. Together with scientific, government and NGO partners, the Novartis Foundation develops and implements strategies to help interrupt leprosy transmission, while Novartis donates the treatment for leprosy free of charge.\n\nAbout IDRI: As a nonprofit global health organization, IDRI (Infectious Disease Research Institute) takes a comprehensive approach to combat infectious diseases, combining the high-quality science of a research organization with the product development capabilities of a biotech company to create new diagnostics, drugs and vaccines.

Still, thanks to science, genetics need not always be destiny, as Martha Teichner shows us in our Cover Story:\n\nAmy and Brad Price\u2019s home in Omaha, Nebraska, is crazy with all the kids around. There are seven of them, ages 2 to 11. But if you look closely, you\u2019ll see small memorials to one more: Liviana, who died in 2013 at the age of 5\u00bd of a rare, nightmare disease called late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy. MLD destroys brain cells and is caused by a single, faulty gene.\n\n\u201cShe was happy all the time,\u201d Brad said.\n\nShe was talkative, addicted to \u201cCaillou,\u201d the animated TV series, a lively little girl, \u2018til she was two. \u201cHer knees were going a little knock-kneed,\u201d Amy said. \u201cAnd she had been just randomly falling down.\u201d\n\nHer doctor said, \u201cNothing to worry about,\u201d but she quickly got worse.\n\n\u201cI was in the kitchen doing something and I heard her crying,\u201d Amy recalled. \u201cAnd I turned around and said, \u2018Liviana, what\u2019s wrong?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Mommy, my legs don\u2019t work.\u2019\u201d\n\nLiviana was diagnosed in the fall of 2010. Amy recalled: \u201cShe\u2019s sitting on the bed in her tutu and her colorful sweater, and they\u2019re telling me she\u2019s gonna die.\u201d\n\nMany children with the disorder are dead by the age of 6. And it runs in families. If it hadn\u2019t been for Liviana, Amy and Brad Price would never have known to have their other children tested. They learned that their infant son, Giovanni, had inherited the faulty gene, too.\n\n\u201cI get a call from the doctor\u2019s office,\u201d said Amy, \u201cI knew. And I was thinking, \u2018I\u2019ve just been told two of my kids now are gonna die.\u2019\u201d\n\nExcept that\u2019s not what happened.\n\nDoing research online, Amy Price discovered the existence of a medical trial in Milan, Italy, of an extraordinary gene therapy treatment for MLD that would save Giovanni\u2019s life -- and later, when his sister, Cecilia, was born with MLD, hers, too. The treatment works only on children who, like them, have not yet started showing symptoms.\n\nThe Price family scraped together the money to go to Milan.\n\n\u201cThe patients go to the surgery room for collection of the stem cells on Monday, and receive their cells back on Friday evening,\u201d said Dr. Alessandra Biffi, who oversaw the trial.\n\nA patient\u2019s stem cells contain the faulty gene, which the doctors have learned how to fix. Amazing, right? But then they need a vehicle to insert the good gene into the stem cells before those are put back into the patient\u2019s body.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s really amazing: That vehicle is the HIV virus, re-engineered so the children can\u2019t get AIDS.\n\nWhy the HIV virus? \u201cIs it particularly efficient at getting around the body?\u201d Teichner asked.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s very efficient in entering our cells, and that\u2019s why we use it,\u201d Dr. Biffi replied.\n\nHow well did the children do? It will take years to know for sure, but so far so good. \u201cAt least 70-80% of them have an outstanding benefit coming from the treatment,\u201d Dr. Biffi said. \u201cSome of the children were going to school and having a normal life.\u201d\n\nGiovanni Price is six now, in first grade. He and his sister Cecilia (Ceci for short) have to go back to Milan twice a year to be tested and monitored.\n\nBrad Price calls Dr. Biffi \u201cOur angel. She took us in like family.\u201d\n\nSo why Italy, and not the United States?\n\nGene therapy has a checkered history. In the 1990s, hyped as the Next Big Thing, research withered here after serious setbacks, including a death during clinical trials. But more than 15 years later, it\u2019s back. One sign: Dr. Biffi is now head of the gene therapy program at Dana-Farber/Boston Children\u2019s Cancer and Blood Disorders Center.\n\nTeichner asked, \u201cDo you believe that gene therapy is finally coming into its own?\u201d\n\nThe MLD trial, she thinks, demonstrates what\u2019s possible -- offering promise to the 30 million Americans who suffer from some 7,000 rare diseases.\n\nTrials for the experimental treatment Ceci and Giovanni Price received in Milan have not begun in the U.S. They are two of only 24 children in the world with MLD to receive it.\n\nCompare Giovanni to Calliope Joy Carr, also six, from Bala Cynwyd, Pa., outside Philadelphia. She can turn her head, a little. She can still smile and laugh. But that\u2019s about all. She was diagnosed at 2.\n\nFor her parents, college professors Patrick Carr and Maria Kefalis, coming to terms with the disease was wrenching. \u201cIt\u2019s decline in slow motion, and that\u2019s difficult,\u201d said Carr.\n\n\u201cI remember the social worker said, \u2018It\u2019s good to try to cry in the shower to save it from your family and your children,\u2019\u201d Kefalis said.\n\nAfter more than a year of rage and grief, Kefalis decided that she had to find some way of helping MLD children. It was too late for Cal, but she was desperate to give her daughter\u2019s life meaning.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not wealthy people,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know very influential people who could write a big check for a million dollars. And so we said, \u2018Well, we\u2019ll start selling cupcakes.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Calliope Joy Foundation was formed in 2013. It\u2019s been slow going, but the money added up. And when Kefalis learned about the Italian trial, and the fact that Amy Price had to keep going back to Milan with Giovanni and Ceci, it was clear she would use the money to help families get to Italy.\n\n\u201cShe sent me a picture of Giovanni playing in his front yard,\u201d Kefalis said. \u201cHe\u2019s three months younger than Cal, so he should\u2019ve been as sick as Cal. He should have been on a feeding tube. He should be paralyzed. And I thought, I gotta be a part of this. I need to help this happen again and again and again.\u201d\n\nMaria Kefalis has turned cupcakes into weapons of war -- her war against MLD. She\u2019s raised more than $250,000, and helped where she could, but she\u2019s hit a wall. So far, not a single gene replacement therapy has been approved by the FDA. The trial in Italy is closed to new patients. It could be years before any children with MLD will be allowed to receive the treatment in the United States.\n\n\u201cNow, it\u2019s just impatience,\u201d Kefalis said. \u201cNow it\u2019s, like, \u2018When do we get this here? What will it take. Tell me what you need me to do.\u2019\u201d\n\nUntil then, she continues to fight her battles one cupcake at a time -- the Price children, Giovanni and Cecilia, proof to her the war can be won.\n\nTeichner asked Brad and Amy Price, \u201cYou keep using the word \u2018miracle.\u2019 In what way is all of this a miracle?\u201d\n\n\u201cOur son\u2019s still with us, and Cecilia as well,\u201d they replied. \u201cThat\u2019s the miracle.\u201d\n\u2022 New hope for young patients with rare genetic disease (\u201cCBS Evening News,\u201d 10/16/15)\n\u2022 Follow the Calliope Joy Foundation on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The\u00a0mention of gene therapy\u2019s difficult past, including deaths in clinical trials, is valuable\u00a0context for the reader to understand the potential risks of experimental treatments, so we\u2019re glad the story mentioned that.\nHowever, there should have been some discussion of the potential harms of this new treatment.

As rates of sugar-related disorders such as diabetes, obesity and heart disease climb, many experts believe that when Americans rid themselves of fat, they simply replaced it with sugar in all its forms.\n\nBut that the rise of the chronic diseases was actually linked to higher sugar consumption is a challenge. Dr. Robert Lustig, from the department of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco, who has made a name for himself publishing books and research addressing the question of sugar\u2019s effects on the body, wanted clearer answers. Now, in a paper published Tuesday, he and his colleagues believe they have come up with the definitive evidence that sugar, as Lustig says, \u201cis toxic.\u201d\n\nIn most lab studies, the doses of sugar that scientists test are quite high; they want to see what the effect is quickly and, depending on the research, they may not have time to wait to study the more gradual effects that might emerge. And in studies where people reduce the amount of sugar they eat, for instance, those people end up eating fewer calories overall, so it\u2019s difficult to know whether any changes are due to the removal of sugar or to the drop in calories.\n\nLustig and his colleagues think they\u2019ve produced the \u201chard and fast data that sugar is toxic irrespective of its calories and irrespective of weight.\u201d\n\nMORE: FDA Wants Nutrition Labels to Include More Detail on Added Sugars\n\nLustig\u2019s confidence comes from the unique study, described in , of 43 Hispanic or African-American children aged eight to 18 years old. He collected detailed food questionnaires from each of the adolescents to get an idea of the average amount of calories they ate per day, then designed a special menu for each of them for nine days that matched the total numbers of calories they would normally eat. The only difference in the nine-day diet was that most of the sugar the children ate was replaced by starch \u2014 the overall number of calories remained the same. The children weighed themselves daily, and if they were losing weight, they were told to eat more of the provided food in order to keep their weight the same throughout the study.\n\n\u201cEverything got better,\u201d says Lustig. Some of the children went from being insulin resistant, a precursor state to developing diabetes, in which the body\u2019s insulin levels can no longer keep up with the pace of breaking down sugar that\u2019s coming in from the diet, to insulin sensitive.\n\nMORE: Artificial Sweeteners Aren\u2019t the Answer to Obesity: Here\u2019s Why\n\n\u201cWe took chicken teriyaki out, and put turkey hot dogs in. We took sweetened yogurt out, and put baked potato chips in. We took pastries out and put bagels in,\u201d says Lustig. \u201cSo there was no change in [the children\u2019s] weight and no change in calories.\u201d\n\nAfter nine days of having their total dietary sugar reduced to 10% of their daily calories, however, they showed improvements in all of these measures. Overall, their fasting blood sugar levels dropped by 53%, along with the amount of insulin their bodies produced since insulin is normally needed to break down carbohydrates and sugars. Their triglyceride and LDL levels also declined and, most importantly, they showed less fat in their liver.\n\nMORE: 7 Amazing Things That Happen to Your Body When You Give Up Soda\n\nBecause some of the children lost weight, to convince themselves that the effects weren\u2019t due to the small amount of weight that some of the children lost, Lustig and his team compared those who lost weight to those who didn\u2019t during the study, and found similar improvements in both groups.\n\n\u201cUp until now, there have been a lot of correlation studies linking sugar and metabolic syndrome,\u201d says Lustig. \u201cThis is causation.\u201d\n\nThe diet he provided the children isn\u2019t considered ideal from a health perspective \u2014 starches are still a considerable source of calories and can contribute to weight gain. But Lustig relied on the starches to prove a point in a scientific study \u2014 that the effect sugar has on the body goes beyond anything connected to its calories and to weight. \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting in any way, shape or form that we gave them healthy food,\u201d he says. \u201cWe gave them crappy food, shitty food, processed food \u2014 and they still got better. Imagine how much even better they would have gotten if we didn\u2019t substitute and took the sugar out. Then they would have gotten even better yet. That\u2019s the point.\u201d\n\nMORE: The Trouble With Sugar Free Kids\n\nNot everyone is convinced that the results definitely prove sugar, and not weight loss, is the culprit, however. Susan Roberts, professor of Nutrition, USDA Nutrition Center at Tufts University notes that because some of the children lost weight, it\u2019s still possible that shedding the pounds helped their metabolic measures to improve. She also points out that the children self-reported their initial diet, which can often be inaccurate. \u201cWe know that a healthy diet and weight loss cause good metabolic changes, and although this study tries to attribute its effects to low fructose, in fact it is impossible to do that because of the study design.\u201d\n\nSome experts are concerned for other reasons. They\u2019re worried that the findings may shift attention away from what they consider to be the more fundamental issue \u2014 that overall, we\u2019re eating too much. \u201cToo much calorie intake is still the biggest problem,\u201d says Dr. Mark Corkins, professor of pediatrics at University of Tennessee Health Science Center and member of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on nutrition. He notes that the study involved children who were obese already and consuming too many calories. \u201cIt\u2019s an important study, and the facts coming out of it are very important. It means we need to look at sugars, and at the type of sugars and sugar intake. But I worry that people are going to hang everything on this when we still need to reduce consumption.\u201d\n\nLustig hopes that won\u2019t happen as more data emerges that details how sugar is altering the body in unhealthy ways outside of its caloric contribution. That wasn\u2019t the subject of the current paper, but he promises follow up studies based on this work that will address that. This study does hint however, at what might be happening. While there has been a lot of attention on the presence of belly fat and its connection to metabolic syndrome, the fact that the children saw improvements in the amount of fat in their liver suggests that might be an important way that sugar is contributing to chronic disease. Obese children and those with diabetes often suffer from fatty liver, a condition normally associated with alcohol abuse but increasingly common among non-drinkers who gain excessive amounts of weight.\n\nThis new view of sugar could change the advice that doctors and government health officials give about eating the sweet stuff. Lustig\u2019s hope is that the information is considered as the U.S. Department of Agriculture finalizes its latest Dietary Guidelines, expected by the end of the year, which delineate recommendations for what, and how much of different types of foods and nutrients Americans should eat.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "It\u2019s\u00a0hard to say what \u201charms\u201d or risks would result from cutting sugar from childrens\u2019 diets.

Most of the population is thought to get adequate amounts for that reason.\n\nDuring the study, Sweden did not fortify foods, nor did kids use a lot of supplements.

They are also at increased cardiovascular risk, particularly if their rheumatoid arthritis is not controlled.\"\n\nProfessor Babaeva's previous research showed that treatment with anticytokine drugs can decrease the activity of rheumatoid arthritis. Extra-low dose anti-TNF\u03b1 reduced levels of inflammatory mediators and cytokines including C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor, TNF, interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The effect was more apparent and developed earlier when patients were treated with a combination of anti-TNF\u03b1 and anti-IFN?, both at extra-low doses.\n\nThe current study investigated the impact of the combination of drugs on cardiovascular events. It included 68 patients who had suffered from active rheumatoid arthritis for at least five years. Patients were randomised to receive the combination of anti-TNF\u03b1 and anti-IFN? plus standard disease-modifying therapy (38 patients) or placebo plus standard therapy (30 patients). During the three year follow up period the investigators monitored rheumatoid arthritis disease activity and cardiovascular events.\n\nPatients taking the combination of anticytokines had a lower rheumatoid arthritis disease activity score, as measured by the DAS28,2 and more dramatic decreases in IL-1, IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 than the group on standard therapy alone.\n\nThe incidence of cardiovascular events (unstable angina, severe hypertensive crisis, and deterioration of chronic heart failure) was more than double in the group on conventional disease-modifying drugs alone (37%) compared to those also taking the combination of anticytokines (13%).\n\nProfessor Babaeva said: \"Our findings suggest that the decreased rheumatoid arthritis disease activity with the combination of anticytokines translates into decreased cardiovascular risk. Rheumatoid arthritis promotes the development of cardiovascular disease in a number of ways. Therefore, decreasing disease activity may also reduce cardiovascular risk by slowing down or halting these processes.\"\n\nFor example, rheumatoid arthritis is associated with dysfunction of the blood vessel lining (called endothelium), which leads to lipid accumulation in the artery wall, plaque formation and atherosclerosis. Increased disease activity is also linked with a pro-coagulant state in which patients are more prone to blood clots and thrombosis. Patients with active disease have an increase in molecules that promote inflammation, which has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nIn patients with hypertension, target blood pressure was reached in 71% of those taking the combination of anticytokines compared to just 32% of patients on standard therapy alone. Professor Babaeva said: \"This doesn't mean that the two drugs directly impact on blood pressure. But the combination can improve endothelial function and it could be that blood pressure is more stable when disease activity is low.\"\n\n\"We found that the combination of two anticytokines containing extra-low doses of antibodies against TNF\u03b1 and IFN? can improve the efficacy of standard rheumatoid arthritis therapy and decrease cardiovascular risk,\" said Professor Babaeva.\n\nShe concluded: \"We do not think that all patients with rheumatoid arthritis should be treated with this combination. In patients with highly active disease, the standard biologics are better at preventing severe complications such as progressive joint destruction and/or systemic manifestations (vasculitis, uveitis, involvement of internal organs). We recommend this new approach for preventing cardiovascular events in patients with moderate disease activity who are not receiving the standard biologics and who do not have severe complications.\"", "question": "Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "No mention of harms, and there are known rare, but serious, adverse effects associated with all of the biologic drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "ILC 2017: The study evaluated the use of a direct-acting antiviral treatment in children aged 6 to 11, for whom the standard of care has been pegylated interferon plus ribavirin\n\nApril 21, 2017, Amsterdam, The Netherlands: A study presented today that evaluated an investigational dosage of once-daily ledipasvir 45 mg/sofosbuvir 200 mg (LDV/SOF) in children aged six to 11 years infected with the Hepatitis C virus (HCV), found that 99% of children (n=89/90) had undetectable levels of HCV-RNA 12 weeks after treatment.

A sticky mucus clogs organs, particularly the lungs and liver. It can also cause digestive problems. About 1,000 new cases are diagnosed each year, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and the average person with the disease dies before age 40.\n\nIvacaftor works for people with the G551D mutation of cystic fibrosis. Konstan says that only about 4% of the people with the disease have this specific mutation. \u201cIt really is a major milestone in the treatment of cystic fibrosis,\u201d he says. \u201cEven thought it only affects a small percentage (of patients) the hope is there that we can finally do something about this disease.\u201d\n\nThe study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine Wednesday, looked at 84 people who got the drug. Those taking ivacaftor saw improvements within two weeks, which continued for the nearly yearlong trial. Drug recipients could blow out more than 10% more air from their lungs compared with patients who were not taking the drug, and were about half as likely to have a \u201cpulmonary exacerbation\u201d or a worsening of their lung disease that often requires hospitalization.

Someone with a body mass index in the overweight range is almost twice as likely to have GERD as a person of normal weight. Losing weight is one of the best ways to find relief without having to rely on medication.\n\nQuitting smoking, limiting alcohol and avoiding carbonated drinks are also important protective measures. Smoking and alcohol can loosen tension of the upper esophageal sphincter and cause symptoms of reflux like hoarseness, postnasal drip and shortness of breath by irritating the mouth, larynx and trachea, Dr. Aviv reports.\n\nEating big meals, lying down before a meal is digested, and exercising too soon after eating can also trigger symptoms. Reflux sufferers are often advised to eat five or six small meals a day rather than one or two big ones, and to avoid eating within three hours of bedtime. For further protection, the head of the bed can be raised by six inches or more.\n\nBut while certain common foods \u2014 like raw onions, garlic, citrus juices, coffee and chocolate \u2014 are likely to cause reflux in most people with the condition, Dr. Aviv and other experts emphasize that everyone is different, and trial and error is the most effective way to determine an individual\u2019s trigger foods and drinks. Specialists suggest keeping a food and drink diary for a week or two, recording everything consumed and the timing of symptoms to help identify a person\u2019s trigger foods.\n\nA food does not have to be obviously acidic to be troublesome. High-fat foods are problematic for many people because they take a long time to digest. Dr. Aviv points out that many commercially produced foods and drinks are treated with acid-containing substances to enhance flavor and shelf life. Accordingly, the 28-day \u201chealing\u201d diet he suggests consists almost entirely of natural, unprocessed foods, especially lean protein foods like light-meat poultry, fish, egg whites and low-fat dairy, beans (combined with whole grains), and nonacidic vegetables and fruits.\n\nHigh-fiber foods are very helpful, \u201csecond only to eliminating acidic foods,\u201d Dr. Aviv said. Fiber enhances digestion, reducing pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter, and can aid in weight loss and maintenance, among other benefits like reducing inflammation. Try to eat a pound of vegetables each day, half of which are cooked and the other half eaten raw, as well as half a pound of raw fruit. Good sources include broccoli, carrots, beets, green leafy vegetables, apples, berries, bananas, avocados and pears. Other helpful fiber-rich foods include almonds, walnuts, lentils, chickpeas and lima beans.\n\nIf adopting the above measures fails to fully control acid reflux, taking a proton pump inhibitor may also be needed. But a P.P.I. should be used in the lowest effective dose at the correct time and for the shortest possible period, experts say. \u201cStudies have revealed that 80 percent of Americans may be taking these powerful meds incorrectly,\u201d Dr. Aviv wrote.

When the urge returns, out comes another slap.\n\n\n\nNow imagine those \"slaps\" occurring inside the brain, protecting you in moments of weakness.\n\nIn a report published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Stanford neuroscientists say they've achieved this sort of mind-reading in binge-eating mice. They found a telltale pattern of brain activity that comes up seconds before the animals start to pig out \u2014 and delivering a quick zap to that part of the brain kept the mice from overindulging.\n\nWhether this strategy could block harmful impulses in people remains unclear. For now the path seems promising. The current study used a brain stimulation device already approved for hard-to-treat epilepsy. And based on the new findings, a clinical trial testing this off-the-shelf system for some forms of obesity could start as early as next summer, says Casey Halpern, the study's leader and an assistant professor of neurosurgery at Stanford. He thinks the approach could also work for eating disorders and a range of other addictive or potentially life-threatening urges.\n\nAs a physician-researcher, Halpern specializes in deep brain stimulation (DBS), a surgical treatment in which battery-powered implants send electrical pulses to brain areas where signals go awry.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has approved DBS therapy for movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, tremor and dystonia \u2014 usually in people who haven't responded well to medications. Occasionally DBS is a last-resort treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\n\nAnother study published Monday in PNAS suggests that DBS could help boost memory and other research is exploring its use for substance abuse and other reward-seeking behaviors.\n\nYears ago, the Stanford team developed a mouse model to test if DBS could curb overeating. Granted, mice don't normally gorge themselves. Yet if offered fattier, tastier chow each day for just an hour, within 10 days the mice realize if they \"don't eat this now, that guy's coming back to take it away,\" Halpern says. So the animals learn to binge.\n\nBut when the researchers applied DBS stimulation to a part of the brain's reward circuit known as the nucleus accumbens, the mice quit stuffing themselves.\n\nTrouble is, the moderation wore off in a few days, and the DBS also interfered with the animals' social behavior. That got Halpern thinking about a newer system \u2014 one that doesn't stimulate continuously, like DBS, but switches on briefly only after sensing a trouble signal, much like a pacemaker monitors and responds to abnormal heart rhythms.\n\nIn 2013, the FDA approved a newer-generation device, known as a responsive neurostimulation system (RNS), that does just that. Implanted within the brain, it senses early epileptic seizures and slows their spread with small zaps to the onset area. The RNS system costs around $40,000. But with medical devices, Halpern says, hospitals pay for the hardware and insurance companies often cover the surgery, if clinical trial data are good and the treatment is FDA approved. In the current study, Halpern and coworkers tested the RNS device in the binging mice.\n\nFirst, they looked for a biomarker \u2014 an electrical blip that appears in the brain just before the animal reaches for fatty food. Next, the researchers programmed the stimulator to deliver a 10-second pulse whenever it detects this biomarker. They rigged some mice to this intermittent stimulator. For comparison, other animals got continuous DBS stimulation or random pulses.\n\nThe intermittent system controlled overeating much better than the continuous or random protocols \u2014 and nearly as well as in a separate group of mice that got zapped manually by a researcher watching their behavior on video. Plus, the treatment seemed specific to the food addiction. It did not affect anticipation associated with normal behaviors such as meeting a new mouse.\n\nThe results point to a real-time biomarker for impulsive behavior, says Dennis Turner, a Duke University neurosurgeon who was not involved in the study but wrote an October review about ongoing research on a range of potential brain stimulation biomarkers. \"That's the clear novelty.\"\n\nFiguring out if this biomarker would also work in people is challenging. Few are willing to undergo brain surgery for the purpose of research. But Halpern had a rare opportunity. One of his patients developed OCD so debilitating that he opted for DBS. He agreed to have his brain recorded during the surgery. Since food isn't allowed in the operating room, the researchers monitored the patient's brain as he anticipated payoffs in a computerized money-making task. As reported in the PNAS paper, the characteristic anticipatory signal appeared when he expected to make $5 but not for smaller sums, suggesting some level of specificity.\n\nOf course, it's hard to conclude much from a single subject. But from other research \"we know it's safe to place an electrode in the nucleus accumbens, it's safe to stimulate it electrically, and we expect to be able to tune [the electrode] as we already do with DBS. So it seems like a nice opportunity,\" says Halpern, noting that addictive disorders haven't had new therapies for decades. \"I'm motivated by the clinical need.\"\n\nEsther Landhuis is a freelance science journalist in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Currently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has only approved the medication for use by patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a chronic ailment that is a combination of bronchitis and emphysema.\n\nTreating asthma has never been a one-size-fits-all proposition, so \"having a new class of asthma medications could be potentially important,\" said lead researcher Dr. Stephen P. Peters, a professor of pulmonary, critical care, allergy, and immunologic medicine at Wake Forest University, in Winston-Salem, NC.\n\n\"People are different. Some people will respond to some medications, some respond to others,\" he said.\n\nThe report, funded by the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, is published in the Sept. 19 online edition of the New England Journal of Medicine. The journal is releasing the data early to coincide with its presentation Sunday at the European Respiratory Society meeting in Barcelona.\n\nFor the study, Peters' team tried three drug regimens on 210 asthmatics. These included: Spiriva plus an inhaled steroid; a double dose of the inhaled steroid; and an inhaled steroid plus Serevent, a long-acting beta agonist that relaxes the muscles in the airway.\n\nPatients stayed on each regiment for 14 weeks.\n\nThe researchers found that Spiriva plus an inhaled steroid was more effective than giving a double dose of steroids in improving breathing and controlling asthma for these tough-to-treat patients.\n\nIn addition, the combination of an inhaled steroid and Spiriva was not less effective than using an inhaled steroid plus Serevent, they said.\n\nThat's important, Peters said, because there have been some safety concerns raised about long-acting beta agonists. These drugs carry a note on their labels warning of the possibility of severe adverse events, including death, he noted.\n\nThe results need to be confirmed in a much larger pool of patients, Peters said, and he noted that the patients were not followed long enough to see if Spiriva was able to reduce the severity of asthma attacks and hospitalizations.\n\nIn addition, Spiriva's safety profile among asthmatics still needs to be studied, he said.\n\nBecause the drug is not yet FDA-approved for use in asthma, Peters was reluctant to recommend it for that use. \"My hope is that in three to five years we will have the drug approved for asthma,\" he said.\n\nDr. Shirin Shafazand, an assistant professor of pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, said that \"perhaps there is a role for Spiriva in these poorly controlled asthmatics.\"\n\nHowever, at this stage there is no definitive answer whether Spiriva should or shouldn't be used in asthma, she said.\n\n\"This is a good foundation to design a trial where you would look at Spiriva plus steroids versus doubling the dose of steroids in a large number of asthmatics who are poorly controlled and then you follow them long-term,\" Shafazand said, but right now there is no data on long-term efficacy and safety.\n\nFor more information on asthma, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Harms in the study aren\u2019t quantified.

If it does, Orlistat (xenical) -- currently sold only by prescription -- could be available over-the-counter (OTC) later this year. But it's important to know that the weight loss that's typical for users of the drug -- 5 to 10 percent of total weight -- will be less than many dieters expect. And many consumers may be put off by the drug's significant gastrointestinal side effects, including flatulence, diarrhea and anal leakage.\n\nNor is Orlistat a quick fix for unwanted pounds. To achieve any weight loss, users must also eat fewer calories and exercise more.\n\n\"It's not a miracle drug,\" notes Lawrence Cheskin, director of the Weight Management Center at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in Baltimore, who conducted a study of Orlistat in adolescents. \"None of these [weight loss] medications are.\"\n\nOrlistat was approved as a weight loss and weight maintenance drug by the FDA in 1999 to treat obese and overweight people -- those with a body mass index of 30 or higher -- and overweight people (with BMI of 27 or higher) who already have weight-related health problems including diabetes, heart disease or high blood pressure.\n\nMore than 100 studies involving some 30,000 patients have been conducted with Orlistat, according to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Consumer Healthcare, the maker of Orlistat, which has petitioned the FDA to permit OTC sales of the drug. The company says that 22 million people in 145 countries have taken the drug. \"Orlistat is a very safe and effective drug with a long history of use around the world,\" says George Quesnelle, president of GSK Consumer Healthcare, North America.\n\nIn the longest study of Orlistat, participants who took the drug in addition to eating fewer calories and increasing exercise shed up to 12 percent of their body weight the first year. But by the fourth year of the study, they had regained some pounds. Overall, they lost about 7 percent of their body weight, compared to 4 percent for a control group that dieted and increased physical activity but didn't take the drug. The 7 percent figure works out to about 18 pounds for someone who weighs 250.\n\n\"That's little difference in weight, but significant in terms of medical benefits,\" notes Samuel Klein, director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine. Those lost pounds translate to lower blood pressure, improved blood cholesterol levels and reduced risk of diabetes.\n\nWhile Americans spend an estimated $1 billion on nonprescription weight loss products, few if any of those products have undergone the rigorous testing that is required by the FDA for prescription medications. Some weight loss experts say making Orlistat available directly to consumers broadens the proven options available to people trying to reach a healthier weight. \"It's very exciting,\" Klein says.\n\nBut \"the problem with Orlistat are the side effects,\" notes Johns Hopkins endocrinologist Aniket Sidhaye, co-author with Cheskin of a recent scientific review of Orlistat and other prescription weight loss drugs.\n\nAt the current recommended prescription dose -- 120 milligrams taken up to three times per day, for example up to 360 milligrams daily -- about 70 percent of users experience gastrointestinal complications, Klein says.

The findings were published today in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research.\n\n\"The development of osteoporosis drugs by pharmaceutical companies has focused heavily on blocking CatK in recent years,\" said Dieter Br\u00f6mme, a professor in the faculty of dentistry and a Canada Research Chair in Proteases and Disease. \"All clinical trials to date have failed due to side effects ranging from stroke, skin fibrosis and cardiovascular issues.

(March 9, 2017) - The first year of free lung cancer screening in the Augusta, Georgia area found more than double the rate seen in a previous large, national study as well as a Massachusetts-based screening for this number one cancer killer.\n\nThe higher rates, coupled with the majority of cases being found in early, treatable stages, point toward the need for ongoing, accessible free screening in high-risk populations and underserved regions, say researchers at the Georgia Cancer Center at Augusta University. High risk includes those who have smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for two or three decades and, if they've quit smoking, did so less than 15 years ago.\n\nThe screening of 264 high-risk individuals within a 150-mile radius of Augusta found 3 percent had lung cancer and 75 percent of those were caught early, said Dr. Carsten Schroeder, thoracic oncology surgeon at the Georgia Cancer Center and Medical College of Georgia at AU. The researchers note that a percentage of the patients presenting at screening had early symptoms, like a persistent cough, so the rate of cancer detection in patients who showed no indication of disease was 2.2 percent, still double the rates of previous studies.\n\n\"Lung cancer is still the number one cancer killer in the United States and in our world,\" Schroeder said. \"If we catch it in the early stages, ideally before symptoms surface, we can operate and patients can have an overall survival rate of 90 percent.\" Five-year survival rates are closer to 5 percent in more advanced disease.\n\nThe pioneering National Lung Screening Trial, which began in 2002 and included 33 largely urban centers, found 292 cases of lung cancer among the 26,722 high-risk individuals screened in the first year, for a rate of 1.1 percent. That study also provided the first broad evidence that low-dose computed tomography, or LDCT, was a more effective screening tool than the traditional chest X-ray. A decade later, the Massachusetts-based Lahey Hospital & Medical Center, on which the Augusta screening was modeled, found a .6 percent prevalence in the first 10 months of screening.\n\nLike the previous experiences, the Augusta area screening that started in 2014, also reiterated the ability of LDCT to find lung cancer early, said Schroeder, corresponding author of the study in Southern Medical Journal.\n\nSix of the eight cases found in the screening were considered potentially curable with surgery. Positive results were communicated directly to the participant's primary care provider; negative results were communicated to primary care docs and participants, along with a reminder for another screening in a year.\n\nParticipants, particularly from surrounding, more rural communities, have limited access to health care, Schroeder said. The area's median household income is 27 percent lower than the national average and the poverty level is 67 percent higher, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The Augusta-area experience found generally younger patients, who started smoking earlier in life and had multiple risk factors. Augusta area participants were an average of 60 years old, about half male and female, more than 68 percent were white and nearly 20 percent were black.\n\n\"It doesn't matter how old you are, if you have smoked 30 years, you might want to consider a lung-cancer screening,\" Schroeder said, referencing the reality that some adults started smoking as children. Part of his drive to start a screening program in the Augusta area was that, when he relocated here three years ago from the Cleveland area, he found patients were often referred to him with later, less-treatable disease. In the Cleveland area where Schroeder previously practiced as a faculty member at Case Western Reserve University and where access to health care and/or health insurance was more widely available, early lung cancers might even be detected incidentally when patients had CT scans for a variety of other reasons.\n\nAugusta researchers were able to offer free screening by utilizing natural downtime of the combined positive emission tomography, or PET, and computed tomography, or CT, scanner, said Dr. Norman B. Thomson III, chief of general/cardiothoracic radiology in the MCG Department of Radiology and Imaging and study co-author.\n\nThe combination technology is often used to visualize other tumor types throughout the body and many patients require an injection of sugar dye, which will be taken up by the tumor but must first circulate for about an hour before the scan is done. That means the machine is staffed at times when it is not able to be fully used for other diagnostic procedures, time that provides a natural window for lung screening using just the CT imaging capability in under five minutes from arrival to exit, Thomson said. More typically, a scan could cost between $100-$250.\n\nIn the last decade, CT technology has gotten increasingly adept at picking up early, small nodules, Thomson said. Low radiation doses work well in the lungs, which are mostly filled with air that provides a blank background for nodule surveillance. Thomson notes that means LDCT is also adept at finding things like scar tissue and small inflammatory nodules, that also are more common in the lungs of smokers. Nodules a third of an inch or smaller tend not to be cancer and more solid masses tend to be, Thomson said. They may follow up on smaller nodules in six months, then if the nodule is stable, go back to annual reviews.\n\nAnd while some lung cancers are super aggressive, screening also may uncover some slow-growing versions that - like some prostate cancers - will not threaten life but need to be treated and/or closely followed once found.\n\n\"That's why the acid test for screening is not how many cancers you find or what stage the cancer is,\" Thomson said, rather what screening does to lung cancer death rates. Current evidence definitely supports screening, he said. Also, like lung cancer has been coincidently found in CT scans for other reasons, physicians like Thomson and Schroeder are now incidentally finding cardiovascular disease in their lung cancer screening.\n\nTo date about 700 individuals have been screened in the Augusta area and Schroeder is working to expand statewide, hoping to use the state public medical school's extensive campus network that has students learning from physicians at practices and hospitals across Georgia, as a natural base.\n\n\"We want to reach as many people as we can as early as we can,\" he said. Also, about half of patients screened continue to smoke so screening might also be a logical point for smoking intervention, Schroeder said.\n\nThe original National Lung Screening Trial, orchestrated by the National Cancer Institute and the American College of Radiology, was launched in 2002 and enrolled nearly 54,000 patients nationally. Five-year survival rates were about 70 percent for early cancers and about 5 percent for lung cancer found late.\n\nFollowing the trial, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, a nonprofit organization of cancer centers that develop guidelines for cancer diagnosis and treatment, along with the United States Preventive Services Task Force, which makes recommendations for preventive medicine, recommended screening high-risk individuals on a slightly broader scale, which the Lahey and Augusta area screening used. The group recommends screening for those age 55-80 with a 30-pack year or greater history who have stopped smoking for 15 years or less and those age 50 or older with a 20-pack year smoking history and an additional risk factor other than secondhand smoke, such as family history of lung cancer or a personal cancer history. A pack year means smoking one pack a day for 30 years, or a variation like two packs daily for 15 years. After 15 years of not smoking, the lung cancer risk tends to diminish but never vanishes. Schroeder would prefer the screening still not stop there.\n\nA total of 398 individuals signed up for the Augusta area screening, 350 qualified and 264 actually had LDCT. More than 80 patients were not screened in the first year, primarily because of socioeconomic and travel limitations that created a six-week backlog.\n\nNinety percent of lung cancer is related to cigarette smoking, the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms of lung cancer include persistent, intense coughing, shortness of breath, pain in the chest, shoulder or back and changes in the color and/or volume of phlegm or mucus, hoarseness and coughing up blood.\n\nA 2015 survey of smoking by adults by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found about 15 percent of adults in the country smoked, rates for Georgia and adjacent South Carolina were between 16-20 percent. Rates in Massachusetts, where the Lahey screening occurred, are 12.8 to 16.4 percent. Rates were highest in certain demographics. As examples, smoking rates were highest among those without a graduate education degree certificate and lowest among those with a graduate degree; higher among those living below the poverty level versus above it; and higher among some minorities such as American Indians and Alaska Natives, multiple- race individuals and blacks.\n\nFor more information about free lung cancer screening at the Georgia Cancer Center and MCG, call 706-721-4726 or email lung@augusta.edu.", "question": "Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "CT scans expose a patient to a significant amount of radiation, which this release doesn\u2019t address at all.

Thourani, MD, from Emory University in Atlanta, and colleagues from 12 other institutions in the United States found that transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a safe and effective way to treat aortic stenosis in nonagenarians who qualify for the surgical technique.\n\n\"Historically, extreme elderly patients can be at a very high risk for open surgery,\" said Dr. Thourani. \"We still believe that for those 90 year olds who are low-or intermediate risk, surgical options may be a viable procedure. However, with the advent of TAVR technology, we can now offer these extreme elderly patients a treatment option that otherwise would have been high-risk or prohibitive.\"\n\nAortic stenosis is the most common acquired valve disease in elderly patients and affects nearly 3% of those over the age of 75, according to the American Heart Association. The ability to safely treat AS patients has become increasingly important; the US government predicts that the number of Americans over the age of 85 will exceed 11 million in the next 20 years.\n\nFor the study, the researchers used two different approaches: transfemoral TAVR (TF-TAVR), which is the traditional approach performed via the groin, and transapical TAVR (TA-TAVR), which is performed via the heart muscle. TA-TAVR is an alternative for patients who are medically ineligible for TF-TAVR secondary to severe peripheral vascular disease. While the current study did not evaluate other alternative options for TAVR, these techniques may include transaortic, transcaval, transcarotid, or trans-subclavian.\n\nIn the largest series published to date, between April 2007 and February 2012, 531 nonagenarians underwent TAVR: 329 with TF-TAVR and 202 with TA-TAVR.\n\n\"We evaluated perioperative, short-, and mid-term outcomes following both TF- and TA-TAVR,\" explained Dr. Thourani. \"Compared with an age-sex-race-matched US population, the TAVR patients had a comparable risk of mortality, and quality of life improved within 6 months of the procedure.

Major complications, such as bleeding or vascular issues, occurred in 35% of TF-TAVR patients and 32% of TA-TAVR patients, and more than 80% of patients were discharged home after the procedure.\n\n\"Future studies are needed to address potential differences in outcomes between TF- and TA-TAVR groups,\" said Dr. Thourani, \"but I'm thrilled that we're able to give elderly people the chance to continue enjoying life in their golden years.

Even low levels of dehydration can seriously compromise normal physiological function, yet recent studies looking at hydration in laboring women via the rates of intravenous (IV) fluid showed conflicting results. By pooling the data of several studies, Thomas Jefferson University researchers showed that a higher rate of IV fluids not only decreased c-section rates, but also shortened the overall length of labor by one hour, as well as shortened the pushing phase. The results were published online as an accepted article in Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica.\n\n\"The results are compelling and strongly argue for a change in practice,\" says Vincenzo Berghella, M.D., the Director of Maternal Fetal Medicine and Professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University. \"We have already begun changing practice at Jefferson to give women more fluids in labor, to allow them to have the best chance of delivering vaginally.\"\n\nDr. Berghella and colleagues compiled data from seven small clinical trials that collectively included a total of 1,215 women. Of those, about half (or 593 women) received IV fluids at a rate of 250 milliliters per hour, and the other half (622 women) received fluids at the lower rate of 125 milliliters per hour. General practice in the United States is to administer IV fluids at 125 milliliters per hour during labor.\n\nWith the data pooled, the researchers could see a clear difference in outcomes for women in the two groups. Women getting the faster fluid rate (250 milliliters per hour) were less likely to get a cesarean section. The higher fluid rate also reduced the overall time of labor by an average of 64 minutes, and shortened the pushing phase by nearly 3 minutes, on average.\n\n\"We've known that it's important for women to stay well hydrated during pregnancy and labor.

For men at high risk for the disease -- blacks and men who have a father, brother or son found to have prostate cancer at an early age (before 65) -- that discussion should start at age 45.\n\n\"Because prostate cancer grows slowly, those men without symptoms of prostate cancer who do not have a 10-year life expectancy should not be offered testing since they are not likely to benefit,\" the society notes on its Web site.\n\nAmbivalence over the test hasn't been confined to the United States.\n\n\"In Europe, we have been reluctant to recommend that all men get PSA testing as we have felt that there has been a lack of knowledge,\" agreed lead researcher Dr. Jonas Hugosson, a professor of urology at the University of Gothenburg.\n\nHowever, he believes that with the results of the new 14-year study, \"it feels ethically difficult not at least to inform all men over the age of 50 about PSA and its possibilities. Personally, I would recommend my friends check their PSA,\" Hugosson added.\n\nThe report is published in the June 30 online edition of The Lancet Oncology.\n\nFor the still-ongoing study, Hugosson randomly assigned some 20,000 men to either PSA screening once every two years or no screening. The men were between 50 and 65 at the start of the study.\n\nMen whose PSA levels were above normal were offered more tests, such as a digital rectal exam and prostate biopsies.\n\nOver 14 years of follow-up, deaths from prostate cancer dropped by 44 percent among the screened men, compared with unscreened men, the researchers found. Overall, 44 of the men who had PSA testing died from prostate cancer, compared to 78 men who had not had been screened.\n\nAmong screened men, 11.4 percent were diagnosed with prostate cancer, compared with 7.2 percent of unscreened men. Of the men in the screened group diagnosed with prostate cancer, nearly 79 percent were diagnosed because they took part in the study, the researchers noted.\n\nIn addition, men in the screened group were more likely to have their cancer diagnosed while it was in an early stage. In the screened group, 46 men were diagnosed with advanced cancer, compared with 87 men in the unscreened group, Hugosson's team found.\n\n\"Our study has a longer follow-up than previous studies, but shows that in those men invited [to the study], the risk of dying is only half of that in the control group. In men younger than 60 at study entry, the effect was even more pronounced -- only one-quarter of expected deaths occurred,\" Hugosson said.\n\nMoreover, the risk of over-diagnosis was less than previously thought, with just 12 men needed to be diagnosed to save one life. However, since the benefit of PSA screening requires at least 10 years to be borne out, it still seems questionable to test PSA for men over 70, the researchers noted.\n\nDr. David E. Neal, a professor of surgical oncology at the University of Cambridge in the U.K. and author of an accompanying editorial, believes that, \"PSA testing detects prostate cancer early in its natural history when it causes no symptoms. By doing so, it can save the lives of some men who would otherwise have died of the disease.\"\n\nThis study adds to previous evidence that PSA testing and screening for prostate cancer saves lives, he said. Still, the PSA test remains \"a blunt instrument,\" when it comes to determining the aggressiveness of a particular tumor, Neal said. \"We need better tests that identify more accurately those men destined to develop problems in the future from this disease,\" he said.\n\nIn the United States, PSA testing remains a routine part of most physical exams, according to Dr. Nelson Neal Stone, a professor of urology and radiation oncology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City.\n\n\"I would say 70 to 80 percent of physicians now order a PSA test,\" he said. \"So it is more or less the standard to care in America to get a PSA done.\"\n\nStone noted that screening detects a lot of early cancers, which do not need to be treated. \"When we see patients with low-risk disease we don't treat them, we observe them,\" he said.\n\n\"Younger men benefit most from screening, because they have the greatest risk of dying,\" Stone said. \"This study clearly supports PSA screening to prevent prostate cancer deaths.\"\n\nAnother expert, Dr. Anthony D'Amico, chief of radiation oncology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, added that \"people in good health will benefit from [PSA] screening, but people in poor health may not benefit at all.\" That's because if their prostate tumor is not aggressive they are more likely to die from the other, more serious conditions, he explained.\n\nFor more information on prostate cancer, visit the American Cancer Society.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Although reporting that \u2018just 12 men would need to be diagnosed with prostate cancer in order to save one life\u2019 the story neglected to follow though and examine the harm done to the other 11 men. \u00a0There are psychological consequences of a cancer diagnosis. \u00a0In addition, it wasn\u2019t just that men were diagnosed with prostate cancer that affected the chance that they would die from prostate cancer \u00a0\u2013 at least some of these men also received treatment for prostate cancer. \u00a0There was no discussion of the possible harms that are a consequence of prostate cancer treatment.\nThese are not easy issues, but the story did not mention that the number needed to screen to prevent one cancer death was 293.\u00a0 Those who were screened and got a false positive, perhaps leading to unnecessary followup testing like a biopsy, experienced harms.

A nationwide survey by the National Institutes of Health found that 28 percent of adults in the U.S. are heavy drinkers or drink more than is recommended.\n\nYet, most heavy drinkers don't get the help they need.\n\n\"The biggest problem we have in the field is that less than 10 percent of individuals with an alcohol use disorder get any treatment whatsoever,\" says George Koob, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.\n\nPart of the challenge, researchers say, is that many drinkers don't realize that a medicine long used to help people addicted to opioids quit their drug habit can help alcoholics and other heavy drinkers cut back, too.\n\n\"I thought my only option was AA,\" John tells NPR. We've agreed to use only his middle name; disclosing his trouble with alcohol publicly, he says, would jeopardize his business.\n\nHe's a 47-year-old professional who says he started out as a social drinker \u2014 a few beers with his softball team after a game. But he sank into a deep depression after several deaths in his family, and sought \"solace in the bottle,\" he says.\n\n\"I wanted to numb my thoughts,\" says John.\n\nHe'd often start with hard liquor in the morning, John says, and it wasn't uncommon to have eight drinks or more before the end of the day.\n\nHe worked from home, so he was able to mask the problem for a while. But eventually his wife confronted him.\n\n\"She had come home and I was rushing to hide a glass and she was furious with me,\" he recalls. \"Just absolutely furious.\"\n\nHe went to see Paula DeSanto, a therapist and director of Minnesota Alternatives, in Spring Lake Park, Minn. The center provides outpatient mental health and substance use treatment services.\n\n\"I would say John's story is not unique,\" DeSanto tells us. \"A lot of people are reluctant.\"\n\nSometimes, traditional treatments \u2014 such as residential rehab or a 12-step program like Alcoholics Anonymous \u2014 \"can [lead to] a significant disruption in their lives,\" she explains. \"There's stigma, shame and embarrassment.\"\n\nDeSanto suggested a different approach to John. To help work through the loss and grief he was feeling, counseling can help, she told him. She also recommended he try naltrexone, a prescription drug.\n\n\"Naltrexone is an effective medication for the treatment of alcohol use disorders,\" says Koob. He points to a recent meta-analysis published in the journal Addiction that concluded that naltrexone helped reduce heavy drinking and cravings for alcohol.\n\nThe analysis included data from 64 clinical trials in which people were given either the medication or a placebo pill to test the effectiveness of the treatment. The analysis also found that another drug, acamprosate, is effective at helping people who have already stopped drinking to maintain abstinence, perhaps partly by easing the physical and emotional cravings experienced by heavy drinkers who quit.\n\nSo, how does naltrexone work? The drug seems to curb the euphoric and sedative effects of opiates in the brain. Alcohol is known to activate some of the same receptors in the brain that opioids do, and studies find that by tempering the pleasure from alcohol, naltrexone can help people drink less.\n\n\"It blunts the effects of alcohol,\" says Koob. \"People [who use naltrexone] will say they have a drink, and it's not doing much for them.\"\n\nThat was exactly John's experience. After taking the naltrexone pill, he didn't get the buzz he was used to getting, so didn't want to keep drinking. \"I actually didn't feel the alcohol's effects,\" he says. \"It was startling.\"\n\nIt's now been about five months since he started taking the medication. He has not stopped drinking completely, but says he has cut way back.\n\n\"This is helping me,\" John says. \"I can go out with friends and not worry that I'm going to end up inebriated or sloppy.\"\n\nAccording to the findings of a recent review, both naltrexone and acamprosate, are safe, cost-effective and efficacious. But they are substantially underused, according to the review.\n\nMany physicians are \"unaware that there are medications to treat alcohol use disorders,\" says Koob. His institute is stepping up efforts to work with the medical community on that front, he says, and is also touting Rethinking Drinking, a website aimed at consumers that offers the latest research-based information on a range of treatment options.\n\nAny health care provider who is licensed to prescribe medicine can prescribe naltrexone \u2014 not just mental health professionals or addiction specialists. As as long ago as 1997, a published study showed that treatment of alcohol dependence with naltrexone by primary care doctors can be effective; follow-up research has confirmed that the primary care approach not only works, but makes treatment much more accessible.\n\nAccording to the NIAAA, \"patients can now receive effective alcohol treatment from their primary care doctors or mental health practitioners by combining the newer medications with a series of brief office visits for support.\"\n\nNaltrexone is certainly not a cure-all, researchers say. And it won't help everyone who has a drinking problem \u2014 especially if the disorder is severe.\n\n\"I use these medications as an adjunct to therapy, and group [sessions] and 12-step meetings\" says Dr. Jeffrey Hsu, a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University who is certified in addiction medicine. He says that when used alone the medicines are only modestly effective.\n\nBut there's good evidence that the combination of counseling and drugs such as naltrexone can help people cut back on drinking, or move toward abstinence.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story briefly mentions the drug is \u201csafe,\u201d but does not discuss any side effects of the drug, nor notable interactions or contraindications.

The group numbers about 7,500 patients a year in the United States.\n\nThe one-time infusion, known as CAR T-cell therapy, is made by Kite Pharma, which is based in Santa Monica, Calif., and recently was bought by Gilead Sciences for $11.9 billion. Kite announced Wednesday that the treatment's brand name will be Yescarta and its price will be $373,000.\n\nIn late August, the FDA cleared the first CAR T-cell therapy, which is designed for children and young adults whose leukemia doesn't respond to standard treatments. About 600 patients in the United States fall into that category every year. Kymriah, which costs $475,000, is manufactured by Novartis.\n\nBiotech analysts had expected the Kite price to be lower than Kymriah's, in part because the number of eligible patients is larger and the response rates are lower. Even so, Yescarta's cost is likely to stoke the ongoing debate about high drug prices.\n\nThe FDA approval is the latest step forward for the fast-moving field of immunotherapy, which aims to bolster the immune system to attack malignancies. CAR T-cell therapies are among several approaches, along with treatments called checkpoint inhibitors and cancer vaccines, but they have recently grabbed much of the attention. Dozens of other companies also are working on them.\n\n\u201cToday, marks another milestone in the development of a whole new scientific paradigm for the treatment of serious diseases,\u201d FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement, adding that the approval demonstrates \u201cthe continued momentum of this promising new area of medicine.\u201d\n\nA CAR T-cell therapy involves a complicated and customized procedure in which T cells \u2014 sometimes called the foot soldiers of the immune system \u2014 are removed from the patient. They are sent to a special lab and genetically modified to target a protein on the surface of the patient's cancer cells. Once the modified cells are returned to the patient, their numbers expand exponentially as they become an army of cancer fighters.\n\nIn 2015, Marie Miceli was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma at Siteman Cancer Center in St. Louis, which is jointly owned by Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine. She received chemo and underwent a bone-marrow transplant. Neither worked.\n\n\u201cThe doctors were saying, 'Go see an attorney and get your life in order,' \" the 64-year-old Realtor recalled. Then they offered her a slot in Kite's clinical trial, a last-resort effort. \u201cI could feel it when they put those T cells back in,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the craziest feeling in the world.\u201d When she was checked a month later, she said, her cancer was gone. It hasn't returned.\n\nKite's \u201cvein-to-vein\u201d turnaround period \u2014 from cell extraction to reinfusion \u2014 is about 17 days, according to Frederick Locke, an oncologist at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa and co-leader of the Kite trial.\n\nThe FDA said the safety and efficacy of Yescarta were established in a multi-center trial of more than 100 adults with large B-cell lymphoma. An independent review committee found that 72 percent of patients treated with a single infusion responded to therapy, including 51 percent who then showed no evidence of remaining cancer. Kite has said that at six months, 44 percent of patients were still responding, with 39 percent having no sign of cancer.\n\n\u201cThis is not just an incremental benefit,\u201d said David Chang, Kite's chief medical officer. \u201cIt raises the potential that a cure can be possible.\u201d Some of the first patients who underwent treatment now have been in remission for three to five years, he said, although he cautioned that it's still too early to know whether those patients are cured.\n\nLocke said about 13 percent of patients in the trial had a severe side effect known as cytokine release syndrome, which produces high fevers, low blood pressure and other flulike symptoms. Twenty-eight percent had neurological \u201cevents,\u201d such as severe confusion; three patients died of complications caused by the treatment.\n\n\u201cThese are patients who knew they were out of options,\u201d he said, noting that lymphoma patients who relapse or don't respond to treatment have just a 50 percent chance of surviving for six months.\n\nBecause of the side effects, the treatment will carry a boxed warning, the FDA's most serious. In addition, the agency is requiring hospitals and clinics that dispense Yescarta to be certified after undergoing special training.\n\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults. This type of cancer begins in the immune system and can be fast- or slow-growing, the FDA noted.\n\nKite's CAR T-cell product was developed years ago at the National Cancer Institute by pioneering scientist Steven Rosenberg and licensed to the company for commercialization.\n\nArmin Ghobadi, an oncologist at Siteman who was an investigator in the Kite trial, said the new treatment is \u201cjust the first step\u201d and that researchers are working to make it safer and more effective.

The boxes aren\u2019t the only option for safe sleeping, of course, but health officials say they\u2019re a useful part of a broader safe-sleep education program.\n\nOhio on Wednesday joined New Jersey in offering the cardboard boxes, which double as bassinets, for free. Each box comes filled with a mattress, fitted sheet, onesie and diapers.\n\nThe Baby Box Co. is also handing out the boxes in Minneapolis, Phoenix and San Francisco, with the goal of expanding to all 50 states. The for-profit company also operates in Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Baby Box University, Baby Box Co.\u2019s educational platform, maintains a website that coordinates the educational component of the program.\n\nThe idea for baby boxes started in Finland in the 1930s, and is tied to a sharp drop in sudden infant deaths, according to Dr. Kathryn McCans, a pediatrician who chairs New Jersey\u2019s Child Fatality and Near Fatality Review Board. The boxes provide a clutter-free sleep space that has been shown to reduce accidental and unexpected deaths, she said.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the U.S. rate of sudden unexpected infant deaths has been declining since the 1990s when public health officials began recommending parents put infants to sleep on their backs. About 3,700 sudden unexpected infant deaths were reported in the country in 2015.\n\nThe boxes are a new idea for many Americans.\n\n\u2018\u2018The thought of putting the baby in a box, I was like \u2018wow that\u2019s weird,\u2019\u2019\u2019 said Dolores Peterson, of Camden, New Jersey, who became a first-time mom recently and was among the first to bring home a box.\n\nPeterson\u2019s daughter, Ariabella, just turned 3 months old. She said the program was eye-opening for how much information she learned about how to prevent sudden unexpected infant death.\n\nMcCans says the complimentary items like diapers and onesies are nice, but the more important objective behind the boxes is bringing down infant deaths and grounding parents on safe sleep practices: Place babies on their backs to sleep; Don\u2019t use bumpers in cribs; Keep stuffed animals and blankets out of infants\u2019 sleep spaces; Avoid sleeping in the same bed as infants.\n\n\u2018\u2018No one brings their baby into bed with them because they want their baby to die,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018They do it because they want to be nurturing and they are, but it\u2019s not safe.\u2019\u2019\n\nTo get the boxes, prospective moms can register through babyboxuniversity.com, watch a handful of videos on sleep safety and pass a quiz. Parents can then take their digital or printed-out certificates to a participating hospital for their boxes.

Among children taking cannabidiol, the decrease in the frequency of convulsive seizures -- which involve a loss of consciousness, stiffened muscles and jerking movements -- was 23 percentage points greater than the decrease in seizures among children taking a placebo.\n\nThe study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human trial, which is considered the gold standard test for any new medicine.\n\nGW Pharmaceuticals, a company that is developing cannabidiol medicines, helped subsidize the study.\n\n\"After 3,800 years of cannabis use for epilepsy ... we finally have solid evidence,\" said Dr. Orrin Devinsky, lead author of the study and director of NYU Langone's Comprehensive Epilepsy Center. His own previous research indicates that cannabis was used as early as 1800 B.C. in Sumeria to treat epilepsy; neurologists of the Victorian period used Indian hemp, which is rich in cannabidiol, for the same purpose.\n\nDespite the generally positive results, most study participants reported side effects that included vomiting, fatigue, diarrhea and some liver issues.\n\nA total of 120 patients with Dravet syndrome, ranging in age from nearly 2 to 18 years old, were randomly assigned to receive either an oral solution of cannabidiol or a placebo for a 14-week period.\n\n\"Dravet syndrome is a severe childhood-onset epilepsy that causes multiple kinds of seizures, developmental delays, speech and language problems, behavioral issues and movement and balance problems,\" said Brandy Fureman, vice president of research and new therapies at the Epilepsy Foundation. She was not involved in the new study.\n\nEpilepsy is a neurological disorder that disrupts electrical communication between neurons in the brain. Considered a spectrum disorder, different epilepsy syndromes are defined by clusters of symptoms or features and treated accordingly.\n\nExisting epilepsy medications usually don't work for patients with Dravet, so \"up to 20% of these children die from seizures before age 20 years,\" Devinsky explained.\n\nWithin the study, individual participants experienced convulsive seizures at a rate ranging from four per month, on average, to 1,717 per month.\n\nDuring the 14-week study, frequency of convulsive seizures decreased from an average of 12.4 to 5.9 per month in the cannabidiol group, compared with 14.9 to 14.1 in the placebo group. On average, the change in seizure frequency amounted to a 39% decrease for the cannabidiol group patients, compared with a roughly 13% decrease among the placebo group.\n\nFive percent of the children became entirely seizure-free during the 14-week study. Overall, parents in the cannabidiol group felt that they witnessed \"significantly greater\" positive changes in their children than parents in the placebo group.\n\nHowever, there was a downside. Most (93%) of the cannabidiol patients reported side effects, though three-quarters of the placebo group patients did as well. Nine out of 61 cannabidiol group patients dropped out of the study, eight of them because of side effects, compared with just three of the 59 placebo group patients.\n\n\"Tiredness (somnolence or fatigue) was most common; others were decreased appetite, diarrhea and vomiting,\" Devinsky explained.\n\nBased on the overall results, Devinsky believes CBD should be evaluated for epilepsy types beyond Dravet syndrome, which is caused by a genetic mutation and affects about one in 20,000 to 40,000 children in the United States.\n\n\"No one study decides an issue; the sample size is still relatively small (because this is a rare syndrome and so hard to study large numbers of cases) and the duration of treatment so far has been relatively short,\" Hall, who was not involved in the research, wrote in an email.\n\nStill, Hall said the research, which carefully measured safety and efficacy for a \"substantial\" number of children, showed \"clear evidence of benefits in reducing seizure frequency and severity over the duration of the trial.\"\n\n\"Interestingly, it looks similar to our other seizure medications in terms of efficacy and tolerability,\" Porter said. \"So, sadly, not a home run for most patients but another tool in our treatment regimen.\"\n\nThe marijuana plant is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. Scientific researchers studying cannabidiol must meet federal security requirements and follow federal practices. Some scientists have said these federal requirements have slowed research supporting medicinal benefits of the plant.\n\nPorter believes the study may open the door to having \"more thoughtful discussions with our patients about the efficacy and the side effects\" of cannabidiol. \"Hopefully, the FDA will see this as a sign it should be moved off of Schedule I. If it stays on Schedule I, we will have trouble getting it to our patients when it does become available.\"\n\nChanging the schedule of a drug falls to the Drug Enforcement Administration or the Department of Health and Human Services. An interested party, such as a drug company, may also petition for the process to begin. The Food and Drug Administration and the National Institute of Drug Abuse provide guidance to the DEA when reviewing scientific evidence on which to base a schedule change.\n\nHe noted that generating more evidence of effective use is \"a good thing.\"\n\nThe University of Queensland's Hall believes that boundaries between medical use of cannabinoids and the recreational use of cannabis by adults should not be blurred. \"If future clinical trials confirm these promising results, then appropriate regulation will enable the drug to be safely used for medical purposes,\" he said.\n\nThe Epilepsy Foundation's Fureman said, \"before publication of this trial, much of the clinical evidence about CBD's effects on people's seizures was uncontrolled and anecdotal.\" She added that the new study is \"critically important\" for the epilepsy community, which believes a CBD-based medical product would be a first-in-class therapeutic option.\n\nOn the need for more scientific research, all these experts agree.\n\nAs Devinsky said, \"natural substances are not necessarily safe and effective.

Yet Dr. Bertin has recently changed the way he talks about medication, offering parents a powerful argument. Recent research, he says, suggests the pills may \u201cnormalize\u201d the child\u2019s brain over time, rewiring neural connections so that a child would feel more focused and in control, long after the last pill was taken.\n\n\u201cThere might be quite a profound neurological benefit,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nA growing number of doctors who treat the estimated 6.4 million American children diagnosed with A.D.H.D. are hearing that stimulant medications not only help treat the disorder but may actually be good for their patients\u2019 brains. In an interview last spring with Psych Congress Network, an Internet news site for mental health professionals, Dr. Timothy Wilens, chief of child and adolescent psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital, said \u201cwe have enough data to say they\u2019re actually neuroprotective.\u201d The pills, he said, help \u201cnormalize\u201d the function and structure of brains in children with A.D.H.D., so that, \u201cover years, they turn out to look more like non-A.D.H.D. kids.\u201d\n\nMedication is already by far the most common treatment for A.D.H.D., with roughly 4 million American children taking the pills \u2014 mostly stimulants, such as amphetamines and methylphenidate. Yet the decision can be anguishing for parents who worry about both short-term and long-term side effects. If the pills can truly produce long-lasting benefits, more parents might be encouraged to start their children on these medications early and continue them for longer.\n\nLeading A.D.H.D. experts, however, warn the jury is still out.\n\n\u201cSometimes wishful thinking gives us hope that the impressive short-term relative benefits of medication over other treatments will persist beyond childhood, but I haven\u2019t seen it,\u201d said James Swanson, director of the Child Development Center at the University of California at Irvine. Dr. Swanson, a co-author of a landmark federally funded study, the Multimodal Treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, said that follow-up research found overall improvement but no greater long-term benefits after three years for children who were treated with medication compared to those who weren\u2019t. One possible reason, as the report noted, was that many children refuse to continue taking medication after a year or so, something most parentsof such children well know.\n\nResearch has shown that the brains of people with A.D.H.D. on average look and function differently than those who don\u2019t have the disorder, particularly when it comes to processing two important neurotransmitters: dopamine and norepinephrine. For most people with A.D.H.D., stimulants can temporarily boost focus, motivation and self-control by increasing the availability of these chemical messengers. The question is whether these effects can last once the drugs have left the bloodstream.\n\nIn arguing for \u201cnormalization,\u201d Dr. Wilens cited a major review in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry in late 2013, which looked at 29 brain-scan studies. Although the studies had different methods and goals, the authors said that, together, they suggested that stimulants \u201care associated with attenuation of abnormalities in brain structure, function, and biochemistry in subjects with A.D.H.D.\u201d\n\nBut other A.D.H.D. experts challenge this conclusion. Dr. F. Xavier Castellanos, director of research at the New York University Child Study Center, called assertions that stimulants are neuroprotective \u201cexaggerated,\u201d adding: \u201cThe best inference is that there is no evidence of harm from medications \u2013 normalization is a possibility, but far from demonstrated.\u201d\n\nA.D.H.D. is an exceptionally controversial diagnosis, with particular controversy zeroing in on researchers, including Dr. Wilens himself and some of the authors of the 2013 report he cited who have received financial support from pharmaceutical firms. In an email, Dr. Wilens said he had not received \u201cany personal income\u201d from the pharmaceutical industry since 2009.\n\nAs several experts noted, a major impediment to determining the long-term impacts of A.D.H.D. medication is that a \u201cgold-standard\u201d study would require researchers to assign children randomly to groups that either received medication or didn\u2019t. Such a practice has been deemed unethical due to the widespread belief that the medication can help struggling children, at least in the short-term.\n\nAnd other research has raised new concerns. One peer-reviewed 2013 study co-authored by Dr. Swanson suggested that the stimulants may change the brain over time so as to undermine the long-term response to the medication and even exacerbate symptoms when people aren\u2019t taking them.\n\nDr. Peter Jensen, the former associate director of child and adolescent research at the National Institute of Mental Health, cautioned that parents should not try to force children with A.D.H.D. to take medication when they don\u2019t want to, adding that \u201cmost kids don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\nDr. Jensen, who now heads the REACH Institute, a national nonprofit organization concerned with children\u2019s mental health, once surveyed 100 parents of sons and daughters in their 20s who had been diagnosed with A.D.H.D., asking what made the most difference.\n\n\u201cEighty percent of them said \u2018Love your child.

In other words, even if the dog had been given away for adoption just before the woman gave birth, the healthy microbiome exchange could still take place.\n\nThe study also showed that the immunity-boosting exchange occurred even in three birth scenarios known for reducing immunity, as shown in Kozyrskyj's previous work: C-section versus vaginal delivery, antibiotics during birth and lack of breastfeeding.\n\nWhat's more, Kozyrskyj's study suggested that the presence of pets in the house reduced the likelihood of the transmission of vaginal GBS (group B Strep) during birth, which causes pneumonia in newborns and is prevented by giving mothers antibiotics during delivery.\n\nIt's far too early to predict how this finding will play out in the future, but Kozyrskyj doesn't rule out the concept of a \"dog in a pill\" as a preventive tool for allergies and obesity.\n\n\"It's not far-fetched that the pharmaceutical industry will try to create a supplement of these microbiomes, much like was done with probiotics,\" she said.\n\nThe study, funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Allergy, Genes and Environment Network (AllerGen NCE), was published in the journal Microbiome, along with an editorial in Nature.", "question": "Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "There are no harms mentioned in the release release.

Impaired insulin sensitivity is one risk factor for type 2 diabetes, which is associated with age and obesity and happens when the body can\u2019t properly convert blood sugar into energy.\n\nThe researchers did two brief sleep experiments. On one occasion, the volunteers were permitted just 4.5 hours of rest for four nights, followed by two evenings of extended sleep that amounted to 9.7 hours on average. On another occasion, the same men were allowed to sleep 8.5 hours for four nights.\n\nAfter the four nights of sleep deprivation, the volunteers\u2019 insulin sensitivity had fallen by 23 percent and their bodies had started to produce extra insulin. But when researchers checked again after two nights of extended rest, the men\u2019s insulin sensitivity, and the amount of insulin their bodies produced, had returned to normal, mirroring what was seen during the portion of the experiment when the volunteers consistently got a good nights\u2019 rest.\n\nThe volunteers were given a calorie-controlled diet to limit the potential for their food and drink choices to influence the outcomes.

Participants were evaluated monthly during the first year and every 4-16 weeks during the second year. Most participants received monthly injections during the first six months. Thereafter, participants received additional injections of assigned study drug until DME resolved or stabilized with no further vision improvement. Subsequently, injections were resumed if DME worsened. Additionally, laser treatment was given if DME persisted without continual improvement after six months of injections. Laser treatment alone was the standard treatment for DME until widespread adoption of anti-VEGF drugs a few years ago.\n\nAmong participants with 20/40 or better vision at the trial\u2019s start, all three drugs improved vision similarly on an eye chart. On average, participants\u2019 vision improved from 20/40 vision to 20/25.\n\nAmong participants with 20/50 or worse vision at the trial\u2019s start, visual acuity on average improved substantially in all three groups. At two years, Eylea participants were able to read about 3.5 additional lines on an eye chart; Lucentis participants were able to read about three additional lines, and Avastin participants improved about 2.5 lines, compared with visual acuity before treatment. Eylea outperformed Avastin at the one- and two-year time points. While Eylea outperformed Lucentis at the one-year time point, by the two-year time point gains in visual acuity were statistically no different. At the end of the trial, average visual acuity was 20/32 to 20/40 among participants in all three groups.\n\n\u201cThe results of the DRCR Network\u2019s comparison of Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis will help doctors and their patients with diabetic macular edema choose the most appropriate therapy,\u201d said John A. Wells, M.D., the lead author of the study and a retinal specialist at the Palmetto Retina Center, Columbia, South Carolina. \u201cThe study suggests there is little advantage of choosing Eylea or Lucentis over Avastin when a patient\u2019s loss of visual acuity from macular edema is mild, meaning a visual acuity of 20/40 or better. However, patients with 20/50 or worse vision loss may benefit from Eylea, which over the course of the two-year study outperformed Lucentis and Avastin.\u201d\n\nThe number of injections participants needed was about the same for all three treatment groups. Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis participants on average required nine injections in the first year of the study and five in the second year.\n\nThe need for laser treatment varied among the three treatment groups. By two years, 41 percent of participants in the Eylea group received laser treatment to treat their macular edema, compared with 64 percent of participants in the Avastin group and 52 percent in the Lucentis group.\n\nThe risk of heart attack, stroke, or death from a cardiovascular condition or an unknown cause by end of the trial was higher among participants in the Lucentis group. Twelve percent of Lucentis participants had at least one event, compared with five percent of participants in the Eylea group and eight percent of participants in the Avastin group. This difference in cardiovascular rates has not been seen across all other studies, and therefore may be due to chance. Continued assessment of these serious cardiovascular events and their association with these drugs is important in future studies. Cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke are common complications of diabetes. The occurrence of eye complications, such as eye infections and inflammation, was similar for all three drugs.\n\nResults of the study were published online today in Ophthalmology, the journal of the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

Partial sleep deprivation (sleep for three to four hours followed by forced wakefulness for 20-21 hours) was equally as effective as total sleep deprivation (being deprived of sleep for 36 hours), and medication did not appear to significantly influence these results. The results are published today in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry.\n\nAlthough total sleep deprivation or partial sleep deprivation can produce clinical improvement in depression symptoms within 24 hours, antidepressants are the most common treatment for depression. Such drugs typically take weeks or longer to experience results, yet 16.7 percent of 242 million U.S. adults filled one or more prescriptions for psychiatric drugs in 2013. The findings of this meta-analysis hope to provide relief for the estimated 16.1 million adults who experienced a major depressive episode in 2014.\n\nPrevious studies have shown rapid antidepressant effects from sleep deprivation for roughly 40-60 percent of individuals, yet this response rate has not been analyzed to obtain a more precise percentage since 1990 despite more than 75 studies since then on the subject.\n\n\"More than 30 years since the discovery of the antidepressant effects of sleep deprivation, we still do not have an effective grasp on precisely how effective the treatment is and how to achieve the best clinical results,\" said study senior author Philip Gehrman, PhD, an associate professor of Psychiatry and member of the Penn Sleep Center, who also treats patients at the Cpl.

They also explored how response to sleep deprivation may differ across studies according to how \"response\" is defined in each study.\n\n\"These studies in our analysis show that sleep deprivation is effective for many populations,\" said lead author Elaine Boland, PhD, a clinical associate and research psychologist at the Cpl. Michael J. Crescenz VA Medical Center. \"Regardless of how the response was quantified, how the sleep deprivation was delivered, or the type of depression the subject was experiencing, we found a nearly equivalent response rate.\"\n\nThe authors note that further research is needed to identify precisely how sleep deprivation causes rapid and significant reductions in depression severity.

Results from a pivotal study of the treatment were reported today in the American Heart Association (AHA) journal Circulation Research. Patients with untreatable angina who received the injections of CD34+ stem cells in key areas of the heart had significantly fewer chest pain episodes and significantly better performance on exercise tests than patients who got placebo injections.\n\nDrugs, angioplasty, and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery are the main treatments for angina -- chest pain caused by blocked coronary arteries. About 850,000 Americans have angina that persists despite available treatments. \"These are patients who have been on drugs and may have had multiple angioplasties or CABG surgeries,\" AHA President Gordon Tomaselli, MD, tells WebMD. \"Their activities are severely restricted by their chest pain and right now we have little to offer them.\" The new treatment came from the discovery about a decade ago that CD34+ stem cells stimulate the formation of new blood vessels, study researcher Douglas W. Losordo, MD, of Chicago's Northwestern University tells WebMD. \"Coronary artery disease involves not only the blockage of major arteries, but the death of small vessels, or capillaries, of the heart muscle,\" he says. \"This treatment targets these small vessels that have been damaged. The stem cells have shown the ability to repair and replace them in animal models.\" The approach also showed promise in a 2007 pilot study involving fewer than 30 patients. The newly reported study included 167 patients with severe angina treated at 26 medical centers across the country.\n\nStudy participants received one of three treatments: low-dose CD34+ injections, high-dose injections, or placebo. Patients were given a drug for several days to increase the number of CD34+ stem cells in the blood. Blood was collected and processed to collect the stem cells, and then, using a catheter threaded into the heart, the researchers injected the CD34+ cells into areas of the muscle that had been identified as oxygen-deprived areas.

This year, 4,400 patients are expected to undergo surgery to replace arthritic or injured ankles with artificial joints made of metal alloys and lightweight plastic, according to industry estimates.\n\nFour models are commonly used in the United States, with Food and Drug Administration approval. And demand is expected to grow as more and more baby boomers hobble into their 60s and 70s with debilitating ankle pain.\n\nAnkle replacement has been around for three decades, but it has been slow to catch on. Problems with early devices left surgeons and patients wary. The operation is complex, and many foot and ankle surgeons lack experience. While Medicare pays for ankle replacement, many private insurers do not.\n\nEach year about two million Americans visit the doctor for ankle pain from arthritis or fracture. An estimated 50,000 people a year experience end-stage ankle arthritis, in which the ankle cartilage has worn away completely, causing painful bone-on-bone contact and some level of disability.\n\nUntil lately, such patients have had only one surgical option: ankle fusion surgery, in which the worn-out part of the joint is removed and the bones are permanently locked together with screws and plates. The procedure usually relieves pain, but the patient loses mobility in the ankle, leading to changes in gait and, ultimately, additional wear and tear and arthritic pain in other parts of the ankle. About 25,000 ankle fusions were performed in the United States last year.\n\nAndrew Keaveney, now 73, shattered his ankle in a fall from a truck while hanging flags as an American Legion volunteer. Surgery repaired the broken bones, but he continued to have severe pain.\n\nDoctors suggested ankle fusion, but he found a surgeon who offered total ankle replacement. He had the operation in December 2008, and now he says the ankle is \u201c99 percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore the surgery, I couldn\u2019t sleep at night,\u201d said Mr. Keaveney, of Locust Valley, N.Y. \u201cNow I\u2019m able to climb ladders. I have absolutely no pain. I was even playing soccer with my grandkids a few months ago.\u201d\n\nHis surgeon, Dr. Craig S. Radnay, an associate at the Insall Scott Kelly Institute for Orthopedics and Sports Medicine in New York City and on Long Island, says he is now a \u201cbig believer\u201d in ankle replacement for certain patients.\n\n\u201cFor an ankle replacement you have to be a little more picky in who you select for those cases,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t tell you how many patients come in, and I mention this option they don\u2019t even know exists.\u201d (Dr. Radnay, who says he has performed more than 100 ankle replacements using an Inbone device from Wright Medical Group of Arlington, Tenn., is now a paid consultant to the company, helping to gather data on long-term success rates.)\n\nThe ideal patient is around 60 years old and of normal weight, although doctors consider older patients, depending on their health. People with diabetes may not be good candidates because they may risk complications as a result of poor blood circulation.\n\nDr. Jonathan T. Deland, chief of the foot and ankle service at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan, said that while the devices had improved, he remained cautious about offering the operation. (Dr. Deland is helping to develop a new ankle replacement device for Zimmer of Warsaw, Ind., which may be submitted for F.D.A. approval this year.)\n\n\u201cThe big concern about ankle replacement is how often do they fail and how often do they loosen,\u201d he said.\n\nComplications can include slow healing, as well as infection. Severe complications are rare, but they can result in amputation. Still, Dr. Deland said, \u201cwe\u2019re getting fewer and fewer failures.\u201d\n\nThe new models require that less bone be removed, so the bone to which the device is affixed is stronger. In addition, instruments used to guide surgeons in aligning the artificial joint have improved. Dr. Deland cited data showing that for some recent models, 90 percent of ankle replacements were still in place after an average of eight and a half years.\n\nThough the four devices in common use have technical differences in design and in how they are implanted, doctors say the choice of device matters far less than the experience of the surgeon. The procedure is among the most difficult that foot and ankle surgeons perform, and one of the biggest challenges is getting proper alignment of the replacement joint.\n\nDr. Brian Donley, an orthopedic surgeon who is director of the foot and ankle center at the Cleveland Clinic, says patients should always ask their doctor to disclose any financial interest in a device. (He performed the first United States operation using the Salto Talaris device from Tornier of Minneapolis, and receives consulting fees from the company.)\n\nEven with a successful implantation, patients should not necessarily expect to have the same ankles they did at 18. They should not try to return to activities like basketball and distance running. But golf and walking, and sometimes even skiing, are typically allowed.\n\n\u201cMy happiest patients I have in my practice are my ankle replacement patients,\u201d Dr. Donley said. \u201cThey are so appreciative about how their life has been changed.

Then, the researchers analyzed diffusion tensor MRI scans taken just before the two-year period for all 20 people.\n\nThe researchers found that people who went on to experience cognitive decline had significantly more signs of damage to their white matter. The researchers repeated their analysis in a separate sample of 61 people, using a more refined measure of white matter integrity. With this new analysis, they were able to predict cognitive decline with 89 percent accuracy when looking at the whole brain. When the researchers focused on specific parts of the brain most likely to show damage, the accuracy rose to 95 percent.\n\n\"We could tell that the individuals who went on to develop dementia have these differences on diffusion MRI, compared with scans of cognitively normal people whose memory and thinking skills remained intact,\" Raji said. \"What we need now, before we can bring it into the clinic, is to get more control subjects and develop computerized tools that can more reliably compare individual patients' scans to a baseline normal standard. With that, doctors might soon be able to tell people whether they are likely to have Alzheimer's develop in the next few years.\"\n\nAlthough there are no drugs available yet to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease, identifying those at high risk of developing dementia within the next few years could still be beneficial, the researchers said. People could make decisions on their financial and living arrangements while they are still in full control of their faculties.", "question": "Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The news release did not delve into potential harms, including anxiety and false results.

Abroms, ScD, MA, an associate professor of prevention and community health at Milken Institute School of Public Health (Milken Institute SPH) at the George Washington University. \"The study's findings suggest a potential new quitting strategy, especially for those later in their pregnancies and older pregnant women.\"\n\nThe researchers recruited pregnant women who were already enrolled in an established text messaging program called Text4baby. Text4baby has been found to have a positive health impact on alcohol consumption during pregnancy--but not smoking. Abroms and her team wanted to find out if a more intensive mobile phone program called Quit4baby would be more effective. To find out, the team recruited nearly 500 pregnant women, who smoked an average of 7 cigarettes per day and wanted more help to quit.\n\nQuit4baby is targeted to smoking cessation and sends more text messages--between 1 and 8 per day aimed at bolstering a pregnant woman's resolve to quit. The messages help educate the women about the health risks associated with smoking and they are interactive--allowing a woman to text back for more help if she is experiencing a craving or goes back to smoking.\n\nAfter three months, 16 percent of the women who were enrolled in both Text4baby and Quit4baby had quit compared with just 11 percent of women getting just Text4baby. However, the difference between the two groups did not reach statistical significance, the authors say.\n\nThe more intensive intervention did seem to help two subgroups quit smoking at least in the short run, Abroms says. The combo of Text4baby and Quit4baby helped women age 26 and older and those in the second and third trimester of pregnancy quit through the delivery date and in some cases beyond. However, the researchers found that the resolve to quit seemed to disappear postpartum as many of these women started smoking again.\n\nVery little help is provided to pregnant smokers who want to quit so the study's findings are important, especially if the strategy can be adjusted to be more effective, Abroms says. Despite the health risks, about 10 percent of women smoke throughout their pregnancy in the United States.\n\nAdditional studies must be done to find out if Quit4baby can be paired with other smoking cessation tools in order to provide long-term help for pregnant women who want to kick their smoking habit for good, she says.\n\nThe study, \"A Randomized Trial of Text Messaging for Smoking Cessation in Pregnant Women,\" was published October 2 in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.\n\n*The headline of this release was edited for clarity to match the content in the body of the release.\n\nThe research was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes of Health.

That may spare the patients from additional testing and additional costs.\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the study, however, experts wrote that using CT scans to gauge bone density could lead to some people being incorrectly diagnosed, particularly if people at low risk are tested.\n\nIn this study, the average age was about 59 years old - six years younger than the age at which the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government-backed panel, recommends all women begin being screened for osteoporosis. The disease affects over 12 million Americans over 50.\n\nThe panel also suggests younger women at an increased risk for bone fractures should be screened, but there\u2019s no recommendation for men of any age.\n\nDespite DXA scans being safe and cost effective, Pickhardt and his colleagues say the test is underused. CT scans, however, are considered overused - with more than 80 million performed in the U.S. during 2011.\n\nFor the new study, the researchers analyzed test results from 1,867 patients, who had both types of scans performed within six months of each other over a 10-year period, to see if their CT scans showed osteoporosis as well as the DXAs.\n\nOverall, about 23 percent of the people were diagnosed with osteoporosis, about 45 percent were diagnosed with some bone-weakening and about 32 percent were healthy based on their DXAs.\n\nThe researchers then found that their ability to accurately diagnose those same patients with osteoporosis from a CT scan depended on what threshold for bone density they used.\n\nDr. Sumit Majumdar, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study, said a lower threshold for bone density would catch most cases of osteoporosis and limit \u201cincidentaloporosis\u201d - incorrect osteoporosis diagnoses \u201cdiscovered\u201d while doctors were looking for something else.\n\nAt the lower threshold, the researchers found 9 percent of those diagnosed with osteoporosis were misdiagnosed.\n\nPickhardt said the screenings would have to target the right groups of people to prevent overdiagnosis.\n\n\u201cObviously it\u2019s something we need to worry about, but if you apply it to a population that\u2019s suitable for diagnosis you wouldn\u2019t run that risk,\u201d he said.\n\nMajumdar, a professor of medicine at the University of Alberta in Canada, said CT scans are better tests, but stomach scans don\u2019t include the hip - like a DXA would.\n\nA DXA can cost a couple hundred dollars, while a CT scan can cost about $500. Both involve radiation.\n\nDr. Beatrice Hull, from the Center for Osteoporosis and Bone Health at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, told Reuters Health that she\u2019d want her patients to have a DXA scan even with a diagnosis from a CT scan.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think at this point this one test is going to prevent further testing.

We currently have to rely on liver biopsy to measure fibrosis at its early stages - by examining a piece of the liver under the microscope.\n\n\"We know that the presence of even mild fibrosis of the liver predicts a worse long-term outcome for patients with NAFLD and so it's important to be able to detect liver scarring at an early stage.\"\n\nIn this first stage of research the team developed the blood analysis in 26 patients with NAFLD. The test detects chemical changes on tiny amounts of \"cell-free\" DNA that are released into the blood when liver cells are injured. Changes in DNA methylation at genes like PPAR\u03b3 that controls scar formation are then used to stratify patients by fibrosis severity.\n\nSenior author Dr Jelena Mann of Newcastle University's Institute for Cellular Medicine added: \"This is the first time that a DNA methylation 'signature' from the blood has been shown to match the severity of a liver disease.\n\n\"It opens up the possibility of an improved blood test for liver fibrosis in the future.\"\n\nDr Timothy Hardy is a hepatology registrar within Newcastle Hospitals and a Medical Research Council-funded clinical research training fellow at the University.

Most people will only ever develop the first stage, usually without realising it.\n\nIn a small number of cases it can progress and eventually lead to liver damage, cirrhosis and liver cancer if not detected and managed.\n\nThe main stages of NAFLD are:\n\n1. Steatosis (\"fatty liver\") - a build-up of fat in the liver cells that is often picked up as an incidental finding during tests carried out for another reason \n\n2. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) - a more serious form of NAFLD, where the liver has become inflamed; this is estimated to affect up to 5% of the UK population \n\n3. Fibrosis - where persistent inflammation causes scar tissue to form in the liver, but the liver is still able to function normally \n\n4. Cirrhosis - the most severe stage, occurring after years of inflammation, where the liver shrinks and becomes scarred and lumpy; this damage is permanent and can lead to liver failure (where the liver stops working properly) and liver cancer\n\nIt can take years for fibrosis or cirrhosis to develop and the presence of this scarring predicts those people with the worse prognosis.

Brenner, a professor of radiation oncology at Columbia University who co-authored the most recent of a series of reports in the past year warning about the potential risks of CT scans. \"On an individual basis there's probably not a big risk, but a small cancer risk applied to an increasingly large population spells trouble down the road. That's the concern.\"\n\nAlthough some prominent medical groups have issued warnings against overusing the exams -- especially for children -- some experts worry about frightening patients away from the invaluable tests.\n\n\"You don't want people to avoid getting a potentially lifesaving diagnosis or therapy because they are afraid to get a CT scan,\" said Arl Van Moore Jr., a Charlotte radiologist who chairs the American College of Radiology's board of chancellors. \"When a scan is done the right way for the right reasons, the benefits clearly outweigh the risks of doing it.\"\n\nCT (computed tomography), sometimes called CAT (computed axial tomography), is performed by computerized machines that scan patients with X-rays to create three-dimensional cross-sectional images of organs and other parts of the body, providing far greater detail than standard single X-rays.\n\nThe number of scans performed each year in the United States has increased sharply, rising from about 3 million in 1980 to at least 67 million in 2006. There are many reasons for the increase, including improvements in the technology that have speeded the procedure, a growing list of uses and a proliferation of the machines.\n\n\"CT has become ubiquitous,\" said Jason Launders, a senior project officer at the ECRI Institute, an independent nonprofit health-care research organization outside Philadelphia that released a report last year warning about the potential risks. \"Now if you go into an emergency room you can be scanned in a few minutes. You can't get that kind of information any other way. So physicians tend to use CT as sort of a first line in working out a diagnosis.\"\n\nThe use of CT scans is expected to continue to rise as possible new applications, such as for lung and colon cancer screening, become more widespread.\n\nWhile the value of CT scans for screening remains the focus of debate, no one questions the value of the tests for allowing doctors to quickly diagnose a wide variety of health problems, including head injuries, heart problems, cancer, appendicitis, fractures and gallstones.\n\n\"CT is probably the biggest advance in diagnostic radiology that has ever occurred,\" said Thomas Ohlhaber, deputy director of the Division of Mammography Quality and Radiation Programs at the Food and Drug Administration. \"Exploratory surgery that was common 10 or 15 years ago has virtually disappeared and all the risks associated with that have gone away because of CT. But nothing comes free of risks.\"\n\nThe concern comes from the fact that CT scans expose patients to much more radiation than standard X-rays. A CT chest scan, for example, exposes a patient to more than 150 times more radiation than a standard chest X-ray. That's more than twice as much as a typical person receives from the environment in an entire year. (See graphic.)\n\nThe upsurge in CT use has fueled a big jump in the annual amount of radiation that each American is receiving from medical procedures of all kinds. The average level of that exposure has increased about 600-fold since 1980, according to a federal report being published this year.\n\n\"At the moment, about half of medical radiation exposure is from CT scans,\" said Fred A. Mettler Jr., a radiation health expert at the University of New Mexico who helped prepare the report. CT scans represented just a few percent of the average American's exposure to radiation from medical tests in 1980, he noted.\n\nBecause it would take decades to follow a large number of patients who have undergone CT scans to determine the exact risks posed by the exams, there are no direct data demonstrating the danger. But researchers have estimated the risk based on what is considered the best information available about the health effects of radiation -- data collected from survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as exposure of nuclear plant and medical workers.\n\nUsing that information, experts have estimated that every 1,000 to 2,000 CT scans may produce one fatal cancer that would not have occurred otherwise.\n\nAlthough that overall risk is relatively small, the large number of scans being performed could translate into a significant number of cancers. Brenner and his colleagues estimate that CT scans may be responsible for perhaps 2 percent of all cancers in the United States. The ECRI Institute estimated the scans may be causing 6,000 extra cancers each year, half of them fatal.\n\n\"Twenty years from now we could see a huge bonus of cancer coming through because of indiscriminate use of CT today,\" Launders said. \"That's the real issue people are worried about.\"\n\nThe individual risk varies depending on the age of the patient and the type of scan. Younger people face more risk than older people because they have more time for a cancer to develop. Children are especially vulnerable because their rapidly developing bodies are at least four times as sensitive to the damaging effects of radiation. A child's risk may run as high as one case of cancer for every 500 scans, experts say.\n\nAmong adults, \"young women have the highest risk,\" said Andrew Einstein of Columbia University, who evaluated the risks from cardiac CT scans in a paper published in July in the Journal of the American Medical Association. A 20-year-old woman faced the greatest risk -- one additional cancer for every 143 scans, he reported.\n\nSome question the estimates, saying the risk of exposure from radiation from multiple CT scans may not be the same as from radiation from an atomic bomb.\n\n\"It's very difficult, in our opinion to equate the data from Hiroshima, where you had an instantaneous entire-body dose of radiation, compared to a cumulative dose for multiple CT scans,\" said Moore, the radiologist. \"It's apples and oranges. It's not really the same.\"\n\nEinstein, Mettler and others, however, disagree. \"Radiation is radiation. Those are X-rays that the folks at Hiroshima and Nagasaki got. These are X-rays from a CT scan. They're really the same thing,\" said Brenner, whose report was published in November in the New England Journal of Medicine. \"If the dose is the same, then the risk is going to be the same.\"\n\nAlthough the companies that make the CT machines have been developing new protocols designed to minimize radiation exposure, particularly for children, everyone agrees that the most prudent thing to do is to eliminate unnecessary use.\n\nWhile there are scant hard data about how often CT scans are done needlessly, several experts estimated that perhaps one-third could be eliminated. There are many reasons CTs may be overused. Some CTs are full-body \"virtual physicals\" performed on people who appear perfectly healthy -- a practice widely opposed by medical authorities.\n\nSome say part of the blame lies with physicians who have financial interests in imaging facilities. \"There is statistical evidence that indicates that more scans are ordered when a physician has a financial interest than when he doesn't,\" said Moore.\n\nDefensive medicine also plays a role, with some doctors ordering the tests to stave off accusations that they withheld the most cutting-edge technology from their patients.\n\nIn other cases, overuse results from worried patients and from parents demanding CT scans that may not be needed. Other times doctors may not realize how many tests involving radiation patients have already undergone -- information that could influence a doctor's decision -- or may order a CT scan when other tests that do not involve radiation, such as a blood test, an MRI or an ultrasound, would suffice. \"There are alternatives that are arguably just as good,\" Brenner said.\n\nAnd patients also can take more responsibility for reducing the number of unnecessary scans.\n\n\"If a patient walks in and says, 'Tell me what the dose is from this and tell me what the risk is,' they are going to make the doctor start thinking about it,\" Mettler said.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does a good job of describing the harms of radiation exposure due to CT scans.

I took her to somebody who supposedly could heal through touch,\u201d she said. \u201cWe tried some medication therapies that ended up being really a nightmare for us, and making matters worse.\u201d\n\nMedication is often the first line of defense in conventional medicine for kids with ADD and ADHD, with doctors prescribing everything from stimulants to antipsychotics and even antidepressants to help control the symptoms. The spectrum of ADHD and related disorders is broad, and there is no one-size-fits-all treatment.\n\n\u201cThere were times I remember saying to my husband that her behaviors are holding our family hostage because it could be one meltdown a day, it could be five meltdowns a day,\u201d Amy said. \u201cShe couldn't do anything to stop it, and I really began to realize that her brain wouldn't let her, even if she wanted to be good, her brain wasn't allowing her to.\u201d\n\nMallory\u2019s oppositional behavior reached a fever pitch when the family moved from their home in Hoboken, N.J. to the suburb of Glen Rock, N.J. in 2014.\n\n\u201cShe wasn't able to attend mainstream school anymore and the school that we ended up putting her in was an end-of-the-road school \u2026 in my mind, it was not a place where she belonged,\u201d Amy said.\n\nDesperate for a solution, Amy started searching for success stories about kids like Mallory who had been helped by different therapies.

Others who do not respond to metformin alone are given a second drug to help them maintain normal blood sugar levels. The researchers noted that which drug they should be prescribed is unclear.\n\nThe researchers pointed out that most patients are prescribed a class of drugs called sulphonylureas to supplement metformin. However, these drugs can sometimes lead to hypoglycemia and weight gain, which increases the patients' risk for heart attack and stroke.\n\nTo compare the effects of linagliptin to glimepiride (the most commonly used sulphonylurea), the researchers conducted a double-blind study over the course of two years. The study, which was funded by linagliptin's maker, Boehringer Ingelheim, involved 1,500 people from 16 countries with type 2 diabetes. None of the patients had responded to metformin alone.\n\nAlthough the effectiveness of the drugs were similar, the study showed the side effects of linagliptin were much less severe than those of glimepiride. The researchers found that 7 percent of patients on linagliptin experienced hypoglycemia, compared to 38 percent of patients treated with glimepiride.\n\nThe patients on linagliptin also had fewer heart attacks and strokes compared to those being treated with glimepiride.\n\nThe researchers argued that since linagliptin allows the body to increase the amount of insulin it produces in a glucose-dependent way, the risk for hypoglycemia may be significantly lower.\n\nAnd since hypoglycemia \"can have substantial negative clinical consequences\" in terms of risk for death, illness, mental function and poor quality of life, preventing it is crucial, study co-author Baptist Gallwitz, of Tubingen University Hospital, said in a news release.\n\nThe study authors pointed out linagliptin was licensed in 2011 and this is the first long-term study examining its safety and effectiveness. They added more research is needed to confirm their findings.\n\nOne expert said patients and doctors may still have to balance the superiority of linagliptin against its higher cost in comparison to older drugs.\n\nThe new study provides more evidence that drugs like linagliptin \"are just as good as the old standby sulfonylurea therapies, with the added benefits of inducing fewer hypoglycemic events, causing less weight gain, along with a likely decrease in cardiovascular events,\" said Dr. Stuart Weiss, an endocrinologist at NYU Langone Medical Center and clinical assistant professor at the NYU School of Medicine, New York City.\n\nBut millions of Americans suffer from type 2 diabetes, so \"cost issues favoring sulfonylureas may be the only reason for preferring continued sulfonylurea use,\" he added. The results of a larger, ongoing study currently underway may help resolve the issue of whether the newer drug is worth the extra money, Weiss said.\n\nThe study was published online June 27 in The Lancet.\n\nThe American Diabetes Association provides more information on type 2 diabetes.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "There was inadequate/incomplete quantification of the harms.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "WEDNESDAY, Dec. 21, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- A shorter period of antibiotic treatment for ear infections in young children does more harm than good, a new study finds.\n\nAbout three-quarters of children have ear infections in their first year of life.

But they've never all been connected before. This work, conducted by Jianghong Liu, Jennifer Pinto-Martin and Alexandra Hanlon of the School of Nursing and Penn Integrates Knowledge Professor Adrian Raine, reveals sleep as a possible mediating pathway, the potential missing link between fish and intelligence.\n\n\"This area of research is not well-developed. It's emerging,\" said Liu, lead author on the paper and an associate professor of nursing and public health. \"Here we look at omega-3s coming from our food instead of from supplements.\"\n\nFor the work, a cohort of 541 9- to 11-year-olds in China, 54 percent boys and 46 percent girls, completed a questionnaire about how often they consumed fish in the past month, with options ranging from \"never\" to \"at least once per week.\" They also took the Chinese version of an IQ test called the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised, which examines verbal and non-verbal skills such as vocabulary and coding.\n\nTheir parents then answered questions about sleep quality using the standardized Children Sleep Habits Questionnaire, which included topics such as sleep duration and frequency of night waking or daytime sleepiness. Finally, the researchers controlled for demographic information, including parental education, occupation and marital status and number of children in the home.\n\nAnalyzing these data points, the Penn team found that children who reported eating fish weekly scored 4.8 points higher on the IQ exams than those who said they \"seldom\" or \"never\" consumed fish. Those whose meals sometimes included fish scored 3.3 points higher. In addition, increased fish consumption was associated with fewer disturbances of sleep, which the researchers say indicates better overall sleep quality.\n\n\"Lack of sleep is associated with antisocial behavior; poor cognition is associated with antisocial behavior,\" said Raine, who has appointments in the School of Arts and Sciences and Penn's Perelman School of Medicine. \"We have found that omega-3 supplements reduce antisocial behavior, so it's not too surprising that fish is behind this.\"\n\nPinto-Martin, who is executive director of Penn's Center for Public Health Initiatives, as well as the Viola MacInnes/Independence Professor of Nursing and a professor of epidemiology in Penn Medicine, sees strong potential for the implications of this research.\n\n\"It adds to the growing body of evidence showing that fish consumption has really positive health benefits and should be something more heavily advertised and promoted,\" she said. \"Children should be introduced to it early on.\" That could be as young as 10 months, as long as the fish has no bones and has been finely chopped, but should start by around age 2.\n\n\"Introducing the taste early makes it more palatable,\" Pinto-Martin said. \"It really has to be a concerted effort, especially in a culture where fish is not as commonly served or smelled. Children are sensitive to smell. If they're not used to it, they may shy away from it.\"\n\nGiven the young age of this study group, Liu and colleagues chose not to analyze the details participants reported about the types of fish consumed, though they plan to do so for work on an older cohort in the future. The researchers also want to add to this current observational study to establish, through randomized controlled trials, that eating fish can lead to better sleep, better school performance and other real-life, practical outcomes.\n\nFor the moment, the researchers recommend incrementally incorporating additional fish into a diet; consumption even once a week moves a family into the \"high\" fish-eating group as defined in the study.\n\n\"Doing that could be a lot easier than nudging children about going to bed,\" Raine said. \"If the fish improves sleep, great.

The outcome was excellent, but the recovery was long and horrible. The orthopedist wouldn\u2019t let me drive for six weeks, or run, swim or lift weights for three months. I suffered through weeks of torturous physical therapy. It was nearly six months before I felt normal again.\n\nSo in 2014, after a nurse improperly administered a vaccination that resulted in chronic pain and an MRI revealed another rotator-cuff tear, I vowed I would not go through shoulder surgery (or its aftermath) again.\n\nCortisone injections and physical therapy didn\u2019t help, so I decided to try something else: platelet-rich plasma, a therapy that uses the body\u2019s natural healing properties to mend injuries. Its practitioners believe it will transform orthopedics. Based on my experience with it, I think they are right.\n\nIt may not work for every condition, or for everyone. But it worked for me.\n\n[PRP therapy is popular for sports injuries, but does it work?]\n\nBefore undergoing PRP treatment, I read quite a bit about it, learning that it holds promise for healing soft-tissue injuries such as tearing of the rotator cuff (the group of tendons and muscles that provide stability to the shoulder), tennis elbow, plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendinitis, patella tendinitis and hamstring tears; it may even provide relief for mild to moderate osteoarthritis.\n\n\u201c[PRP] works, and the results have been amazing,\u2019\u2019 says John Ferrell, the sports medicine physician who treated me. \u201cThere still needs to be more research done to perfect the process, but [it] will change the way orthopedics is practiced in the future. We will be more preventive. We will be able to treat ailments noninvasively, and at an earlier stage.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe procedure involves collecting several ounces of blood from a patient\u2019s arm, spinning the blood in a centrifuge to concentrate the platelets and injecting the concentrated platelets into the injury site to stimulate healing. Platelets, the blood cells that promote clotting, contain hundreds of proteins, called growth factors, that are important in repairing injuries.\n\n\u201cPRP works by acting like a stem-cell magnet,\u2019\u2019 says Ferrell, who practices at Regenerative Orthopedics & Sports Medicine, which has several offices in the Washington area. \u201cIt releases growth factors that signal stem cells to come [and] help regenerate the injured area. Rotator-cuff tendon partial tears are notorious for not healing because of the poor blood supply there. PRP actually creates new blood vessels that feed the tendon the proper nutrients it needs to heal.\u2019\u2019\n\nA recent pilot study conducted at the Glen Sather Sports Medicine Clinic at the University of Alberta on rotator-cuff tears supports this. It showed tissue healing in five of seven of the patients who received PRP, as well as improvements in their pain and function.\n\nThe researchers call the results \u201cclinically relevant,\u2019\u2019 despite the study\u2019s small size, and say the next step should be a larger, controlled clinical trial. \u201cI\u2019ve heard some skeptics call PRP a cure looking for a disease, but it is being used in so many areas of medicine now with promising outcomes,\u201d says Marni Wesner, a sports medicine physician at the clinic and one of the study\u2019s authors. \u201cThe potential for benefit from PRP is real.\u2019\u2019\n\nI had my first appointment with Ferrell last October to find out whether PRP might help me. By then, my painful shoulder had been keeping me up nights for more than a year. It bothered me while swimming and lifting weights, and while getting dressed. By performing several tests to assess my strength and range of motion, Ferrell discovered that my left shoulder \u2014 the site of the tear \u2014 was considerably weaker than my right.\n\nHe then used ultrasound to find the tear and showed it to me on a monitor. It turned out to be larger than indicated in the static MRI pictures I had obtained earlier.\n\nBefore deciding whether PRP was right for me, he had to be sure that the tear was the source of my pain and weakness. He injected an anesthetic into the tear, then he ran the strength tests again. My strength was significantly better. This meant that the tear was causing my problems, and fixing it probably would restore strength and function to my shoulder and end my pain.\n\nI had the first PRP injection on Oct. 23. It was painful, and the aching persisted for about 36 hours. I had one bad night, followed by an uncomfortable day. After that, the pain stopped. Still, Ferrell advised me to baby the shoulder \u2014 to use my other arm when holding a dog leash and to skip swimming and weights for two weeks. Running was fine. He also recommended physical therapy after two weeks.\n\nAfter what I went through in 2008, those were restrictions I could live with.\n\nFerrell told me not to use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, such as ibuprofen, for a week after the injection because the goal is to encourage, not stifle, inflammation. Other pain relievers such as acetaminophen were okay. \u201cWe want to stimulate an acute inflammatory reaction, which will trigger the healing cascade to start to work,\u2019\u2019 Ferrell says.\n\nBecause there is not yet enough research on PRP \u2014 and because some studies have shown mixed results \u2014 insurance will not cover it.\n\nStill, \u201cit has significant cost savings\u201d compared with surgery, Ferrell says. The average treatment is two injections, which costs about $1,000 at his practice, whereas rotator-cuff surgery runs about $13,000, he says, although insurance often covers most of the costs of surgery.\n\nWith additional research, insurance may ultimately pay for PRP. Unfortunately, there is little financial incentive to conduct such studies because there is nothing for the Food and Drug Administration to approve, such as a drug or device. The centrifuges already are licensed, and the procedure uses a patient\u2019s own blood, which is regarded as safe. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons \u2014 which says PRP \u201cholds great promise\u2019\u2019 \u2014 describes the risk as minimal.\n\nThose who seek this treatment must look for a clinician with considerable PRP experience \u2014 someone who does the procedure several times a day, not once or twice a month \u2014 and who has a good success rate, Ferrell says.\n\nMoreover, \u201cyou see the greatest results when the injections are done under direct visualization with ultrasound,\u201d he adds.\n\nBy February, the ultrasound showed my tear to be about 80 percent healed. The remaining tear was quite small. Ferrell recommended a second injection to finish the job.\n\nI had it on March 4.\n\nWhen I returned to see him on April 12, I was feeling pretty good. No pain, no problems. He rolled in the ultrasound machine, and I was not surprised by the results.

A new blood test developed by researchers at Lund University in Sweden, Herlev Hospital, Knight Cancer Center and Immunovia AB, can detect pancreatic cancer in the very earliest stages of the disease. The results have been published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\nDue to diffuse symptoms, pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed very late in the disease progression. Therefore, despite pancreatic cancer representing less than 3% of all cancer cases, more people currently die from it than breast cancer. By 2030, pancreatic cancer is expected to be the second deadliest type of cancer in the world.\n\n\"Our test can detect pancreatic cancer with 96% accuracy at stage I and II, while there is still the possibility of successful surgical intervention. There is currently no cure and few treatment options for advanced pancreatic cancer, which is the late stage when pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed\", explains Carl Borrebaeck, professor at the department of Immunotechnology at Lund University.\n\nThe study used samples from patients in both Denmark and the US, at different stages of the disease.\n\nThe blood test is developed on a so-called antibody microarray that consists of hundreds of recombinant antibody fragments. These antibody fragments are specific for a number of immune-regulatory proteins, cancer-associated antigens, and so on.\n\nSince the immune system is the first to respond to threats like complex diseases, such as cancer, autoimmune diseases and infections, the microarray was designed to mirror this early response. This provides information about the development of tumours long before being visible on CT or detected by ctDNA. From those hundreds of markers, 29 markers were selected to detect pancreatic cancer with 96% accuracy at stage I and II.\n\nIn the future, the screening method could be used to screen people who are at a higher risk of developing pancreatic cancer, such as those with a hereditary risk, newly onset diabetes patients and patients with chronic inflammation of the pancreas.\n\nThe next step has already been initiated, which is a large US prospective study for high risk individuals.", "question": "Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Harms are not discussed and two types of harms are relevant here.

He wasn't doing his homework. He was being very difficult with his little brother. And he was just melting down day after day,\" Ellison says. \"So I decided to devote a year to trying out different approaches to see if we could make it any better.\"\n\nIn recent years, more people have been trying an alternative approach called neurofeedback, a type of therapy intended to teach the brain to stay calm and focused. Neurofeedback is expensive, time consuming and still scientifically unproved. But, there's growing evidence that it can help.\n\nEllison says the idea appealed to her immediately.\n\n\"Because I was always wary about using meds as a single approach or for very long, it seemed to be an interesting alternative. It's really like meditation on steroids,\" says Ellison, a journalist who won a Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting -- and who has ADHD herself.\n\nEllison has written a book about living with ADHD called Buzz: A Year of Paying Attention. And one chapter of the book is devoted to neurofeedback.\n\nEllison says she tried meditation, but her mind kept wandering. Neurofeedback is better for people with ADHD, she says, because it provides constant feedback during a session, which is usually done in a therapist's office.\n\nPeople usually sit in a chair facing a laptop screen. The laptop is connected to electrodes applied to the scalp. Special software monitors the electrical activity in your brain. In particular, it measures rhythmic patterns known as theta and beta waves.\n\nProponents of neurofeedback say these patterns reveal when the brain is in a focused and attentive state. So the computer software looks for desirable brain wave patterns and changes the image on screen to let people know how they are doing.\n\nThe image that worked best for Ellison showed a field.\n\n\"When my brain responded the way that it was supposed to, the field would burst into color. I'd hear bird song and beautiful flowers would bloom,\" she says. \"But when I got distracted or when I got a little bit more sped up, the flowers would wilt. It would turn gray, and I'd know that I needed to work a little bit harder.\"\n\nAt first, people can't control their brain wave patterns, at least not consciously. But over time, their brains become conditioned to associate certain patterns with pleasant images or sounds -- a reward for good behavior. And our brains like rewards.\n\nThis sort of brain training can take 40 sessions or more, and typically costs thousands of dollars.\n\nEven though there are studies now showing that neurofeedback works for ADHD, all of these studies have serious limitations, researchers say. So the approach remains promising but unproved, says David Rabiner, a researcher at Duke University who writes a newsletter about treatments for ADHD.\n\n\"Parents do need to know that relative to treatments like medication treatment, to behavior therapy, at this point, the research base is not as extensive,\" Rabiner says.\n\nOn the other hand, Rabiner says, neurofeedback may offer something other treatments can't.\n\n\"The hope for neurofeedback is that after training ends, the benefits that resulted from training will persist -- that in some sense there's been more enduring change in the child's ability to focus and attend and to regulate their behavior,\" he says.\n\nBut it will take better research to figure out whether neurofeedback can live up to that promise, Rabiner says.\n\n\"There has been a need for some time to have the kind of carefully controlled study that would provide more definitive answers for parents and for the field,\" he says.\n\nAnd that research appears to be on the way.\n\nA team at The Ohio State University has nearly completed a pilot study of neurofeedback for ADHD that was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\nThe team had hoped to announce results last week at a scientific meeting in New York, but Gene Arnold, one of the scientists in charge of the study, says they had to delay that announcement because \"we weren't able to get the results analyzed in time,\" he says.\n\nThe results should be out within a few weeks, Arnold says. In the meantime, he says, the study has shown that it is possible to do neurofeedback research that involves a placebo.\n\nThe study used a video game involving race cars. For kids who got neurofeedback, he says, \"The ability to speed up the car and steer it was contingent on maintaining your brain waves in a more favorable ratio.\"\n\nBut other children got a placebo -- a race car that paid no attention to their brain waves.\n\nUntil a large study comes along using this sort of approach, parents and consumers will have to decide for themselves whether neurofeedback is worth the time and effort. Katherine Ellison says that for her and for her son, it was.\n\n\"What I noticed in my son was not necessarily that he'd stop losing things at school or do his homework better,\" she says. \"The improvement I saw was that he was easier to live with.\"\n\nBut brain training might not be the only reason, Ellison says.

Forty-six of the infants had an older sibling with an autism spectrum disorder, while the other 33 had no family history of autism.\n\nChildren who have a sibling with autism are much more likely to develop autism themselves, explained lead study author William Bosl, a neuroinformatics researcher at Children's Hospital Boston. Prior research has shown that about 20 percent of siblings of children with autism will also develop autism and another 40 to 50 percent will have some characteristics of the disorder, such as repetitive behaviors or problems with social interaction, language or communication, but not the full-blown disorder.\n\nWhile the children watched people blowing bubbles, researchers measured the babies' brain waves and analyzed the results using computer algorithms. The algorithms can detect subtle patterns in the lines created by EEGs that the human eye might miss, Bosl explained.\n\nWhen the babies were nine months old, researchers could predict who was in the high-risk autism group -- that is, they had a sibling with autism -- with nearly 80 percent accuracy.\n\n\"In this study, we have taken the first step in showing that there is definitive information in the electrical signals measured by EEG to distinguish normal controls from infants at high risk for developing autism,\" Bosl said.\n\nWhen broken out by gender, researchers found other differences. For example, at nine months they were able to predict which boys were in the high-risk group with near 100 percent accuracy. But accuracy for girls at that age was only 60 percent, not statistically significant.\n\nAt six months of age, however, they could predict the high risk girls with about 80 percent accuracy, though they couldn't do the same for boys that young.\n\n\"It seems perhaps they are on a slightly different developmental trajectory,\" Bosl said.\n\nThe study is published online Feb. 22 in BMC Medicine.\n\nEEGs measure brain electrical activity through electrodes attached to the scalp. The technology has been around for awhile -- developed in the late 1920s, it has been used for more than 60 years to detect seizures in epileptics.\n\nBut it's the newer, artificial intelligence technology and sophisticated computer algorithms that enabled the researchers to look more deeply into what the EEGs show, Bosl said.\n\n\"Artificial intelligence gives us the ability to find patterns we might not find with our own eyes,\" Bosl said. \"One of the difficulties with a disorder like autism is that it's very heterogenous. A very high-functioning person with autism might not be so different from a so-called 'normal' person who is quirky. Defining the differences may be somewhat subtle.\"\n\nEEGs are also relatively inexpensive, painless and safe, Bosl said. And unlike MRIs, they require no sedation, so testing could be put to widespread use, he said.\n\n\"My hope is we would have a simple way of measuring brain activity in every child and see the patterns emerging that might track autism characteristics,\" Bosl said. \"That would be tremendously useful. We know early intervention is extremely important. Right now, for a lot of children, that means 3 years old. What we don't know yet is if you can intervene at 9 or 12 months and how effective that could be.\"\n\nDr. Joshua Ewen, a neurologist and director of the clinical neurophysiology laboratory at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, said the study is well done and looks promising, but needs to be replicated.\n\nAlso, the study predicted who was at high risk of autism, but it's unknown if those babies actually went on to develop autism, he noted.\n\n\"If it can eventually be shown that this technique can reliably identify which children will indeed develop autism, then we will have a valuable tool for early detection,\" Ewen said. \"Early detection continues to be of critical importance, as it opens the door to early intervention, which has been shown to improve outcomes for children with autism.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more on autism.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "No harms were quantified.

Followers of the popular regime eat during an eight-hour window, in this case between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. And for the 16 hours in between, they consume only calorie-free drinks, such as water.\n\nFor 12 weeks, the scientists measured various factors, including the participants' fat mass, blood pressure and cholesterol and glucose levels. The researchers compared the results to existing data from a separate weight loss trial carried out between 2011 and 2015.\n\nIndividuals who ate between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. consumed around 350 fewer calories, resulting in a loss of 3 percent body weight, and their blood pressure dropped by around 7mm Hg.

These compounds minimize one of the risk factors for cancer, inflammation within the body. People who have chronic inflammation because of chronic infection, autoimmune disease or conditions such as obesity have a higher cancer risk because of damage to normal cells.\n\nThe researchers first tested 142 natural compounds on mouse and human cell lines to see which inhibited prostate cancer cell growth when administered alone or in combination with another nutrient. The most promising active ingredients were then tested on model animals: ursolic acid, a waxy natural chemical found in apple peels and rosemary; curcumin, the bright yellow plant compound in turmeric; and resveratrol, a natural compound common to red grapes or berries.\n\n\"These nutrients have potential anti-cancer properties and are readily available,\" says Tiziani. \"We only need to increase concentration beyond levels found in a healthy diet for an effect on prostate cancer cells.\"\n\nThe new research paper also demonstrates how the plant-based chemicals work together.

Nearly 36 percent of these women had never had a mammogram.\n\nAdvanced tumors were found in about 30 percent of the patients who had never been screened but in just over 5 percent of those who had mammograms.\n\nWomen who underwent screening reduced their risk of dying from breast cancer by 49 percent. Women aged 70 to 75 had the greatest risk reduction, reducing the risk of dying from breast cancer by 84 percent. The risk reduction in younger women, aged 50 to 69, was smaller, at 39 percent, but still considered substantial.\n\nThe greater risk reduction in women aged 70 to 75, Otto said, is probably a result of the long-term good effects of screening participation in the earlier target age group, 50 to 69, before the upper age limit for screening was extended in the Netherlands from 69 to 75.\n\nThe study findings ''add to the body of evidence supporting the fact that mammography matters in improving detection and survival,\" said Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"This study focuses on survival.\"\n\nThe study, however, has some limitations, Bernik noted.

What's more, the drug carries a risk of bone damage, stunted growth and heart trouble, and can render children impotent.\n\nThese experts contend that Lupron, costing about $5,000 a month but seldom covered by insurance, is one of many treatments that cash in on the desperation of parents trying to cope with an incurable condition for which medicine has few good answers outside of painstaking behavioral therapy.\n\n\"Not only is there no scientific backing whatsoever for Lupron treatments, there are several major concerns for the children's health,\" said neurologist BethAnn McLaughlin, an adviser to the Dan Marino Foundation autism group in Weston and the mother of two developmentally disabled children.\n\n\"These people are preying on the fears of parents. We cannot be using these children who are so vulnerable as guinea pigs in a medical experiment.\"\n\nUntested autism treatments have flourished while science struggles to explain the disorder, which disrupts the abilities to speak, concentrate, connect with people and control impulses.\n\nFor unknown reasons, autism has been on the rise for the past few decades, with an estimated 675,000 children \u2013 about one in 100 \u2013 now having mild to severe symptoms. Scientists believe it stems from genetic defects that may only cause problems after an environmental trigger.\n\nA vocal subset of parents and activists blame vaccines, especially those with the mercury-based preservative thimerosal, which has been banned from virtually all as a precaution. Numerous studies have found no connection between autism and vaccines or thimerosal.\n\nLupron therapy grew from the mercury camp. Baltimore researcher Dr. Mark Geier started using the drug in 2005 on the theory \u2013 disputed by mainsteam doctors \u2013 that testosterone binds mercury in the body and that many autistic kids have high levels of the hormone.\n\nLupron halts production of the female hormone estrogen, which the body uses to make testosterone. The drug mainly is used to treat endometrial cancer in women and prostate cancer in men, and sometimes to chemically castrate sex offenders.\n\nGeier's promotional materials said he has treated hundreds of children with Lupron and has launched nine ASD Centers in eight states. In his latest, he teams with Dr. David Clayman, a Boca Raton radiologist who has an autistic teen son and is opening an ASD office beside his MRI center in Tamarac.\n\nClayman said he would not comment until he treats patients with Lupron therapy for a year. Geier could not be reached for comment despite several attempts by phone. He told one parent he did not plan to comment for this story.\n\nThe medical group began recruiting Florida patients in March when Geier spoke at a Fort Lauderdale conference for parents of children with autism.\n\nTeresa Badillo was at the meeting. Her family has searched in vain for a way to help their autistic son, Marco, 18. Badillo said he has little speech or interaction with others, but is doing OK in high school. Lately, though, Marco has grown more aggressive, physical and rebellious.\n\n\"We were basically under seige in this house,\" Badillo said. \"This kind of behavior is more scary at 18 [than] at 3. I had choices to make. If you see there is another option out there that can help your child, most parents are going to choose that option.\"\n\nAlso, Marco had discovered sex and sometimes touched himself inappropriately in public, a common problem among those with autism.\n\n\"The kids don't understand. They have impulses. It's what happens when you have high testosterone,\" Badillo said.\n\nThe family put Marco on Lupron about six weeks ago. He gets two injections a month at a dosage larger than used on adult cancer patients, plus a small daily shot.\n\n\"The therapy immediately stopped the aggression,\" Badillo said. \"This is not castrating a kid. It's just lowering the [testosterone] levels enough to normal range so the kid is not aggressive.\"\n\nShe said Geier plans to continue the Lupron for several months to see if it helps Marco's other autistic behavior. She said she knows the drug has risks but believes Lupron critics do not fully grasp the hard realities of life with an autistic child.\n\nLupron critics said autism parents may not understand the dangers.\n\nThe drug is not approved for children \u2013 except a rare few with premature puberty \u2013 because it can impair bone development crucial to growth, said Dr. Gary Berkovitz, chief of pediatric endocrinology at the University of Miami medical school.\n\nIt's not recommended for people with heart disease, kidney disease, asthma, depression or seizures because it can worsen those conditions. Autistic children are prone to seizures.\n\n\"It has not been tested so there's no way to know if it has adverse effects in the long run,\" Berkovitz said.\n\nSaid neurologist McLaughlin: \"We have very significant concerns about irreversible damage to sexual function and the brain and sex organs of these children.\"\n\nIn addition, the Food and Drug Administration is investigating complaints that Lupron causes diabetes in adults.\n\nGeier published a 2006 study contending that 11 autistic children taking Lupron did better on tests of awareness, sociability and behavior.

At Froedtert Hospital the procedure costs about $120,000, an amount that generally is covered by Medicare and private insurance.\n\nThe hospital has done about 300 of the procedures since 2005, said Brad Hiner, an associate professor of neurology at the Medical College of Wisconsin and neurologic director of the hospital's deep brain stimulation program.\n\n\"This (the JAMA study) is the largest, most complete and thorough analysis of deep brain stimulation to date,\" Hiner said.\n\nSome neurologists remain unconvinced about the benefits of the therapy.\n\n\"You are doing something pretty invasive,\" said Paul Nausieda, director of the Regional Parkinson's Center at Aurora Sinai Medical Center in Milwaukee. \"It's got too many downside issues.\"\n\nNausieda said much of the benefit found in the study could be due to a placebo effect.\n\nBeyond that, doctors need to do a better job of optimizing drug therapy, he said, noting that there are thousands of potential combinations of drugs that can be used to control symptoms.\n\nNausieda said that of the more than 5,000 Parkinson's patients he has seen, only about 100 were candidates for deep brain stimulation.\n\n\"It's certainly not a breakthrough,\" he said.\n\nStill, deep brain stimulation and several other potential therapies in the growing field of neurostimulation have created a buzz in the medical community.\n\nClinical trials involving different forms of neurostimulation are looking into its effectiveness in treating a range of disorders, including epilepsy, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and tinnitus, although doctors acknowledge they don't know how the treatments actually work.\n\nIn a sense it's a field of science that works backward: Stimulation is applied to the brain, some people get better, and doctors try to figure out why.\n\n\"We haven't the foggiest notion,\" said UW's Montgomery. \"(But) we used aspirin long before we knew how it worked. God watches out for fools and little children. We are blessed that we have this therapy.\"\n\nThe problem with deep brain stimulation is that many doctors are not aware of its benefits or don't know how to determine the appropriate patients based on risks vs. potential benefits, he said.\n\nUp to 15% of Parkinson's patients are good candidates for the therapy, but only 2% get it, he said.\n\nDeep brain stimulation is not an option for the 20% to 30% of Parkinson's patients who also have dementia, said Hiner, of Froedtert Hospital.\n\nHe said the best candidates are those whose medications are not working well or are causing too many side effects.\n\nWolter, who lives in Oconomowoc, fit that profile well. She was diagnosed with the disease in 1997 after she developed a slight limp.\n\nShe was put on an increasing number of medications, which eventually caused side effects.\n\nAt times, she said, she felt incredibly fidgety.\n\n\"I'd take my pills and feel good for a while, but I never knew when they would wear off,\" she said. \"I don't know what was worse: the medications or the disease.\"\n\nShe said she worried about having the surgery, but it got to the point where she felt as though she had run out of options.\n\nIn the nearly year and a half since having the surgery, her condition has improved substantially, she said.\n\nHer medication use has dropped dramatically and \"my body has calmed down,\" she said. \"I can do what everybody does.\"\n\nIn April she went to Disney World with her two daughters and grandchildren and was able to walk around the park.\n\nThe study was paid for by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and Medtronic, the company that makes the device used in the study.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story mentions the \"much greater risk of serious adverse side effects\" in the same sentence that delivers the positive results.

Paul Amminger of The University of Melbourne in Australia, a researcher on the study, told Reuters Health. But while psychiatrists now know how to identify these individuals, he added, they don\u2019t know what to do with them. \u201cAt the moment there\u2019s no state-of-the-art guideline (on) how to treat those people.\u201d\n\nPrescribing antipsychotic medications may be helpful, Amminger added, but these medications have serious side effects, and can also be stigmatizing. \u201cFor young people they don\u2019t want to commit themselves to a treatment which they might need to take for the next five to ten years,\u201d he said. Furthermore, only about a third of people at high risk for psychotic disorders will go on to develop full-fledged mental illness in a given year.\n\nThere\u2019s considerable evidence that abnormal fatty acid metabolism may contribute to the development of schizophrenia, Amminger and his team note in the Archives of General Psychiatry. To investigate whether omega-3 fatty acids might help prevent psychotic illness, they randomly assigned 81 at-risk individuals, 13 to 25 years old, to take 1.2 grams a day of omega-3s in fish oil capsule form or a placebo for 12 weeks and then followed them for another 40 weeks.\n\nThe researchers included people who met at least one of the following three criteria: having low-level psychotic symptoms; having transient psychotic symptoms; or having a schizophrenia-like personality disorder or a close relative with schizophrenia, along with a sharp decline in mental function within the past year.\n\nSeventy-six of the 81 study participants, or 94 percent, completed the trial, Amminger noted, which underscores the safety and tolerability of fish oil.\n\nAt one year, 5 percent of the study participants taking omega-3s had developed a psychotic disorder (2 of 41 people), compared to 28 percent of those on placebo (11 of 40). People taking fish oil also showed significant reductions in their psychotic symptoms and improvements in function, while they were at no greater risk of adverse effects than people taking placebo capsules.\n\nThe effect of fish oil capsules, Amminger noted, was similar to that seen in two trials of antipsychotic drugs in at-risk individuals.\n\nThere are a number of mechanisms through which omega-3s could protect the brain, Amminger said; they are a major component of brain cells. They are also key to the proper function of two brain chemical signaling systems, dopamine and serotonin, which have been implicated in schizophrenia. Fish oil also boosts levels of glutathione, an antioxidant that protects the brain against oxidative stress.\n\nTrials of medications for treating mental illness typically don\u2019t include people younger than 18, Amminger noted, while starting minors on these medications is \u201calways very difficult, and always quite controversial.\u201d\n\nBut if future research bears out the current findings, he added, fish oil promises to offer a safe way to help prevent psychosis in at-risk people, and could also potentially be used to prevent or delay the onset of chronic depression, bipolar illness, and substance abuse disorder \u2014 all of which are far more common than psychotic illness.\n\nHe and his colleagues are now planning a multicenter trial of fish oil for the prevention of psychotic illness in 320 at-risk people.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "While fish oil supplements are generally recognized as safe, the story could have told readers about potential side effects which can be gastrointestinal and include blood clotting problems, particularly for people taking blood thinners.\u00a0 ", "answer": 1}, {"article": "MONDAY, Nov. 14, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Preliminary research suggests that a single injection of a man-made protein might lower levels of \"bad\" cholesterol.\n\nGiven in the abdomen, AMG145 reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels among a group of healthy volunteers. The shot turned off a newly identified cholesterol regulator, PCSK9, which interferes with the liver's ability to clear bad cholesterol from the bloodstream.\n\nThe findings were presented Monday at the American Heart Association (AHA) annual meeting in Orlando, Fla. The study was funded by AMG145 manufacturer Amgen Inc.\n\nHigh cholesterol is a major risk factor for heart disease. The first step toward lowering cholesterol is typically lifestyle changes, which include eating a low-fat diet and regular physical activity. For some, medications such as statins must be added to get cholesterol levels where they ought to be. Even this is not enough to get everyone's numbers into the safety zone, and not everyone can tolerate currently available medications. An LDL of less than 100 mg/dL of blood is considered optimal.\n\nStudy author Clapton Dias, medical sciences director of clinical pharmacology and early development at Amgen, in Thousand Oaks, Calif., said this shot could be given as an add-on to current cholesterol-lowering therapies for people who are not getting as low as they should be or as a standalone treatment for people who can't tolerate existing lipid-lowering drugs.\n\n\"Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the U.S., and while statins are very effective, a good proportion of people are not meeting their goals, and in this setting the shot could be a valuable addition,\" he said.\n\nThe study included 54 men and two women aged 18 to 45 who did not have elevated cholesterol levels. Participants received one of five doses of the new drug delivered via shot or intravenously or a placebo. Researchers measured LDL cholesterol levels for 85 to 113 days after treatment.\n\nThe new drug did hit its target, PCSK9, and decreased levels of LDL cholesterol by up to 64 percent. There were also decreases seen in levels of total cholesterol and apo-B (tiny fat particles in the blood that also increase the risk for heart disease). Levels of triglycerides and \"good\" HDL cholesterol were not altered by the medication, and there were no serious side effects reported. Now, researchers are testing the new shot in people who have high cholesterol.\n\nCardiologists were cautiously optimistic about the novel therapy.\n\nFormer AHA President Dr. Ralph Sacco said that it is too early to make any predictions about what role, if any, this therapy will have in lowering cholesterol levels, but it could one day fill an important void.\n\n\"Even though statins are so effective at lowering cholesterol and reducing risk for heart disease and stroke, they do need to be taken every day and they can have certain side effects in some people,\" said Sacco, who is also chairman of neurology at the University of Miami. Statin side effects can include liver damage and/or muscle pain.\n\n\"This new shot may provide a more long-lasting approach, especially if it could be given once a month,\" Sacco said.\n\nDr. Dan Rader, director of preventive cardiology at the University of Pennsylvania, said that PCSK9 is \"the hottest target for new treatments to lower LDL cholesterol.\" And these study results will probably fuel that fire, he added.\n\n\"A 60-plus percent reduction in LDL with a single dose of this antibody is impressive,\" he said. \"It is the early days, but the data look strong. We now need more data with people who have repeated dosing and are followed for longer periods of time,\" Rader added.\n\n\"There are still plenty of people who can't achieve adequate LDL levels with existing drugs, including statins,\" he noted.

Rick Perry signed legislation that will require Texas insurance companies to cover the test for men 45 to 75 years old, and for women between 55 and 75, at intermediate or greater risk of heart attack. The law, the first in any state, takes effect Jan. 1.\n\nThe legislation was introduced in 2007 and passed quietly this year. It eventually attracted attention in cardiology circles, where the scans' costs and benefits are the subject of much debate. The scans are sometimes criticized as an example of expensive new technologies being adopted before proof is established that they're better than cheaper existing methods \u2014 an issue at the heart of the health care reform debate.\n\nThe test, a CAT scan of the heart that measures plaque buildup in the arteries, is popular because heart disease, the nation's No. 1 killer, strikes many people without the sort of very high cholesterol that usually predicts it. Doctors say they get many patients who want to know more about their risk because their father suffered a heart attack and died young.\n\nCritics note that no study has linked the use of CT scans with better patient outcomes. They say the test's value is limited because it doesn't identify which plaque are stable and which could rupture and cause a heart attack.\n\nCT scanning, which costs from $100 to $500, has grown exponentially in recent years. One Houston doctor said that there was just one scanner in Houston in the mid-'90s, and now the $1 million machines are all over the city. The Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography estimates more than 200,000 Americans had the test in 2008 at a cost of about $50 million.\n\nThe American Heart Association did not endorse the legislation, which Khera estimates could result in millions of Texans being screened.\n\nThe Texas legislation was pushed by Screening for Heart Attack Prevention and Eradication, a private organization that has called for CT scans on all asymptomatic men 45 to 75 and all asymptomatic women 55 to 75 \u2014 or some 50 million Americans.\n\nTexas Rep.

But new tests for breast cancer risk mutations beyond the well-known BRCA genes would offer actionable information for many women and their doctors, a new study finds.\n\nThe BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations put women at high risk for breast, ovarian and other cancers, but mutations of other genes are believed to confer extra risk as well.\n\nEarlier this year, 17 genetic experts argued against testing for a wider panel of breast cancer-related gene mutations until they are proven to be valid and useful in clinical practice (see Reuters story of May 27, 2015 here: reut.rs/1TvOoDf).\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of controversy even among experts,\u201d said the senior author of the new study, Dr. Leif W. Ellisen of Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center in Boston.\n\nFor 15 years, at-risk women have only been tested for BRCA1 and 2, but many companies now offer multi-gene panels for 20, 25 or 30 other genes, Ellisen told Reuters Health.\n\n\u201cAre patients better off getting these much broader tests?\u201d he said. \u201cDoes it actually change what you would tell them to do in terms of screening, prevention, or risk management?\u201d\n\nAccording to the new results, at least for some women, it would change their clinical management, he said.\n\nSeveral of the authors of the new paper disclosed that they receive research funding, consult for or are employed by genetic testing companies like Myriad Genetics and Invitae Corporation.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2014, the study team did panel tests for 25 or 29 genes on 1,046 women who were referred for hereditary breast or ovarian cancer gene testing, but had tested negative for BRCA mutations. Most of the women had a personal history of breast or ovarian cancer already.\n\nThe researchers found that 40 women, or 4 percent of the total group, did have potentially harmful mutations in other genes. Of those 40 women, 26 had mutations carrying low to moderate risk of breast or ovarian cancer, eight had mutations associated with Lynch syndrome, which increases colon and ovarian cancer risk, and three had high-risk breast cancer genes.\n\nIncluding another 23 patients who were referred into the study at a late stage, there were 63 women positive for non-BRCA mutations. Of those, the researchers decided that 33 would have been considered for additional screening or prevention measures based on their results. And for many, family testing would be recommended for first-degree relatives, according to the report in JAMA Oncology.\n\nEven among all appropriate candidates who are sent for genetic testing, only nine percent will test positive for the BRCA mutations, so an additional four percent who have non-BRCA mutations is a significant number, Ellisen said.\n\nOften these additional women do not have a high risk of breast or ovarian cancer, but some do have a high risk of colon or uterine cancer, and would be referred for additional screening, he said.\n\nMultigene testing is not more expensive than testing for the BRCA mutations alone, he said.\n\nThough these results indicate that additional genetic screening is clinically useful, some genetic test results will be uncertain, and it can be psychologically difficult for patients to deal with this uncertainty, Ellisen said.\n\n\u201cWe do not advocate for broad population-based screening,\u201d he said. \u201cThe interpretation of these tests is not a simple color-by-numbers thing.\u201d The vast majority of uncertain genes will be benign, but a misinterpretation could lead a patient to a drastic, unnecessary surgical procedure, he said.\n\n\u201cMany cancer genetics experts have again urged caution, characterizing the use of multigene testing in the clinical setting as premature,\u201d Dr. Elizabeth M. Swisher of the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle writes in a commentary accompanying the new paper.\n\n\u201cYet thousands of women and their physicians are ignoring this advice, ordering a wide selection of multiplex tests daily,\u201d Swisher writes. \u201cThe train has left the station and is unlikely to return,\u201d so it is important to assess how useful this additional testing can be, she concludes.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Potential harms, including having uncertain results leading to psychological difficulties, were mentioned in a quote from the lead author, who also discussed the complexity of interpreting the results.

Recent findings point to the benefits of breastfeeding on heart disease and other specific cardiovascular risk factors,\" said Lisette T. Jacobson, Ph.D., M.P.A., M.A., lead author of the study and assistant professor in the department of preventive medicine and public health at the University of Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita.\n\nThis is among the first studies to examine breastfeeding and a possible relationship to stroke risk for mothers, as well as how such a relationship might vary by ethnicity.\n\nResearchers analyzed data on 80,191 participants in the Women's Health Initiative observational study, a large ongoing national study that has tracked the medical events and health habits of postmenopausal women who were recruited between 1993 and 1998. All women in this analysis had delivered one or more children and 58 percent reported ever having breastfed. Among these women, 51 percent breastfed for one-six months, 22 percent for seven-12 months and 27 percent for 13 or more months. At the time of recruitment, the average age was 63.7 years and the follow-up period was 12.6 years.\n\nAfter adjusting for non-modifiable stroke risk factors (such as age and family history), researchers found stroke risk among women who breastfed their babies was on average:\n\u2022 19 percent lower in women who had breastfed for up to six months. A longer reported length of breastfeeding was associated with a greater reduction in risk.\n\n\"If you are pregnant, please consider breastfeeding as part of your birthing plan and continue to breastfeed for at least six months to receive the optimal benefits for you and your infant,\" Jacobson said.\n\n\"Our study did not address whether racial/ethnic differences in breastfeeding contribute to disparities in stroke risk. Additional research should consider the degree to which breastfeeding might alter racial/ethnic differences in stroke risk,\" Jacobson said.\n\nBecause the study was observational, it couldn't establish a cause-and-effect relationship between breastfeeding and lower stroke risk, meaning that it is possible some other characteristic that distinguishes between women who breastfeed and those who don't is the factor changing the stroke risk. However, because the Women's Health Initiative is large, researchers were able to adjust for many characteristics, and the effects of breastfeeding remained strong, Jacobson said.\n\n\"Breastfeeding is only one of many factors that could potentially protect against stroke. Others include getting adequate exercise, choosing healthy foods, not smoking and seeking treatment if needed to keep your blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar in the normal range,\" Jacobson said.\n\nThe study was also limited by the relatively small number of strokes that occurred during the follow-up period (just 3.4 percent of the women experienced a stroke during the study period and 1.6 percent reported having had a stroke prior to the study) and by the Women's Health Initiative's exclusion of women who had already had severe strokes at the time of recruitment.\n\nCurrently, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend exclusive breastfeeding for six months, with continuation of breast feeding for one year or longer. For babies health, the American Heart Association recommends breastfeeding for 12 months with transition to other additional sources of nutrients beginning at about four - six months of age to ensure sufficient micronutrients in the diet.\n\nFrontiers: The Heartland Institute for Clinical and Translational Research and the Wichita Center for Graduate Medical Education-Kansas Bioscience Authority funded the study.

The study looks at adults with chronic low back pain, one of the leading cause of disabilities in the United States and one reason why more and more people are addicted to painkillers.\n\nLed by Daniel C. Cherkin of Group Health Research Institute in Seattle, the experiment involved randomly assigning 342 adults with the condition to meditate, talk with a psychologist or continue with their normal techniques for addressing the pain, such as medication. The first group engaged in yoga and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), which focuses on being aware of and accepting physical discomfort. The second group participated in cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) to change pain-related thoughts and behaviors during eight weekly two-hour group sessions.\n\nThe participants in the small study ranged in age from 20 to 70 and had suffered from back pain for an average of 7.3 years.\n\nThe results for both techniques were very positive. At 26 weeks, 61 percent of those in the meditation group reported improvement in the activities they could do, compared with 58 percent in the CBT group and 44 percent of those who stuck to their usual routines. The results for pain improvement were similar, with 55 percent in the meditation group reporting improvement compared with 45 percent in the CBT group and 27 percent in the usual-care group. The numbers were similar when rechecked at 52 weeks.\n\n\"These findings suggest that MBSR may be an effective treatment option for patients with chronic low back pain,\" the authors wrote.\n\nThe study did caution that 30 of the 103, or about one-third, of the participants in the meditation group reported an \"adverse event,\" most often an increase in pain due to yoga.\n\nIn an editorial, Madhav Goyal and Jennifer A.
