This latest study raises a number of questions about the methods used to compare lung cancer deaths in three different groups of people. The screened group was made up of heavy smokers living in New York who were recruited by Henschke and her team specifically for a study of CT screening. There was no control group, so in this study statistics from two other unrelated studies are used. One group (CPS-II) was made up of people who reported being smokers as part of a large nationwide study of cancer in general. The second group (CARET) was a subset of smokers who took part in the control group of a trial of drugs to prevent lung cancer.\nThe story takes note of earlier controversies involving Henschke and points out that this study attempts to compare groups of people with important differences and then calculate estimates of the number of lung cancer deaths would have been expected in the first group if they had not been screened. \nAlthough the headline, lead and concluding lines of this story don\u2019t incorporate these and other concerns, we give the story credit for attempting to address challenging questions of scientific and statistical methods.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Tremors limited to the hand and forearm, for instance, might respond better than tremors that also affect the shoulder.\nLarger studies, van der Walt said, should look at whether Botox is more effective for some tremors than others.\nLarger studies, of more-diverse groups of MS patients, are needed, he said.\nIf Botox is eventually approved for this MS symptom, LaRocca said it will be important for doctors to get training in how to give the injections \u2014 since the drug has to go into carefully chosen locations in the muscle.\nMuscle weakness was the most common side effect in this study, van der Walt said.\n", "question": "Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

It also fails to mention several of the caveats and limitations that the researchers noted in their journal article, including the possibility that misclassification of the participants based on their initial testing could affect the results. In other words, rather than actually improving during the study, it is possible some of the teens were actually better readers from the beginning, but just scored low on the baseline tests.\nNevertheless, we rate the story as satisfactory because it appropriately describes this study as helping researchers to understand the disease, rather than evaluating the clinical usefulness of brain scans. Also, one paragraph deep in the story highlights the preliminary nature of the research; specifically that the study included only 25 participants with dyslexia, \u201cwhich is too small a sample size to prove anything.\u201d It also notes that the study did not look at whether different varieties or reading instruction or other interventions might have had some effect and it includes a comment from an independent expert about the lack of data on instruction or other factors that could influence reading ability.
