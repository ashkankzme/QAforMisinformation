However, the headline that the test can \u201cpredict Alzheimer\u2019s\u201d and the lead sentence stating that the test is \u201c100 percent accurate\u201d will likely mislead most readers. Although the story is careful to note that the \u201caccuracy\u201d claim involved only the subset of study participants who already had significant memory loss and who then went on to develop Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, readers are likely to mistakenly believe that the test was \u201c100 percent accurate\u201d at predicting Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. Indeed, while the researchers did report that all of the 57 participants who progressed from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer\u2019s Disease during the study did have the biomarker pattern associated with Alzheimer\u2019s, there were another 85 participants with impairment and the \u201cdisease\u201d pattern who did not progress during the study.\n\nThe body of the story notes many of the limitations of the information this test provides, but those caveats are overshadowed by the strong wording of the headline and lead sentence.\nCorrection and addendum on August 16:\u00a0\u00a0       \n\n \n \nThe \u201c100%\u201d figure comes not from the subjects in this current study, but from a validation test that used data from a different study. We mistakenly thought the 57 subjects who went from impairment to Alzheimer\u2019s were part of the 142 impaired (MCI) subjects in the main study who had the Alzheimer\u2019s biomarker pattern. Actually, the 57 subjects were part of a completely separate study reported in Lancet Neurology in 2006 that was used to validate the biomarker pattern in this study. The researchers looked at 57 subjects who progressed from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer\u2019s over a five-year period in that separate study. While they did report that spinal fluid from all 57 of those subjects did contain the \u2018disease pattern\u2019 of biomarkers in their spinal fluid, there were actually 137 participants whose spinal fluid was collected in that second study. The researchers did not report the biomarker patterns from 80 participants who did not progress to Alzheimer\u2019s during that study, so we do not know if any of those individuals had the \u2018disease pattern\u2019 of biomarkers.\n\nIn addition, the researchers did report the results of a second validation test using a group of subjects who had Alzheimer\u2019s confirmed during autopsies. The spinal fluid biomarkers in those subjects showed a 93 or 94 percent match to the \u2018disease pattern\u2019 depending on the model used.\n\nAlso, it is worth noting that these biomarker patterns are not black-or-white, yes-or-no results. Individual results are placed along a spectrum and there is a gray zone between those that fit the definition of the \u2018disease pattern\u2019 in this study and those who fit in the \u2018healthy pattern.\u2019 As this sort of testing eventually moves out of small research studies into clinical use involving perhaps millions of people, that gray zone will contains multitudes.\n\nThe term \"100%\" exudes certainty.
