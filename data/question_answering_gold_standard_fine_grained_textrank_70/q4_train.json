One of our reviewers on this release, a clinician and associate professor at Harvard Medical school, thought that this should have been recognized as a hypothesis that is not well supported by a large body of literature. It is not that the pancreas is not producing insulin in Type 2 diabetes, rather it is not producing enough and the insulin being produced is being blocked, especially by the fat cells throughout the body. Losing weight decreases the amount of fat and improves insulin resistance \u2014 leading to improved sugars. The hypothesis proposed in this release also is inconsistent with a growing body of genetic studies pointing to the underlying mechanisms that are associated with the development of Type 2 diabetes.

We only measured food frequency at baseline, which was on average 7 years before the time of MRI WMH assessment (range, 2-14 years), and thus participants could have changed their diet before the MRI was performed. However, dietary patterns appear to be stable in other population-based studies. In addition, despite the use of a valid and reliable food frequency questionnaire to calculate MeDi scores, a potential for both random and systematic misclassification of dietary habits persists, although any misclassification is most likely to be random and thus tending to minimize an association between a MeDi and WMHV. Most studies depend on similar methods, and they are a practical approach, albeit subjective in nature. In addition, we used the traditional MeDi score method to quantify adherence, but this too has limitations because the score is based on the cohort- and sex-specific median values across 9 food categories, which does not readily allow for an examination of dose-dependent associations. However, most population-based studies have used this approach. Although the potential for confounding always exists, the persistence of associations after adjustment for many potential confounders suggests that this form of bias does not account for the associations observed. The MRI study population represents a subcohort of the overall NOMAS cohort and was younger and generally healthier than the full cohort. However, as mentioned previously, we did not observe diet differences between those who were included and excluded, again suggesting that selection into the study cohort did not bias our results.

However, we thought the story should have mentioned that the margarine used in this study contained trans fats, which are now known to be harmful and may have contributed to the increased mortality in the linoleic acid group.

So even though the AHA advises consumers to\u00a0consume plenty of omega-6 fat, it\u2019s never been totally clear if the heart benefits observed in these studies were due to the omega-6 fat or the omega-3 fat. Only a handful of studies replaced saturated fat with omega-6 fat exclusively, and the study reported on here is one of them.

In this study, the men in the intervention group may have been more comfortable not aggressively treating their cancer because they were getting the VTP.

For instance, neither the journal article nor the release describe the brushing technique instructions given to study participants. A description of the trial posted at ClinicalTrials.gov indicates that participants were told to brush once a day for one minute, which is less often and briefer than the twice-a-day for two minutes many dentists commonly recommend. Even the Plaque HD label recommends brushing at least twice a day. There is no indication that researchers tracked how often or how long participants actually brushed. Also, participants in this trial used manual toothbrushes, not electric ones, which in some studies seem to do a better job reducing plaque. These features of the trial are important and should have been discussed.\nWhat if the participants using Plaque HD brushed longer than those using the placebo paste, because they could see the stained plaque that was on their teeth? Could it be that brushing frequency and duration are important variables, as some studies of oral cleanliness have found? Is it possible that simply using a timer, so that the participants using the placebo toothpaste brushed just as long, might have minimized differences between the groups?\nThere are some key statistics that are left unexplained in the journal article and not mentioned in the release. For instance, hs-CRP levels actually rose in the placebo group. Why? And if the levels had not changed, as would be expected, would that have wiped out the claimed advantage of Plaque HD? What\u2019s more, the researchers excluded 23 of the 61 participants (38 percent) from the hs-CRP analysis because their baseline levels were already very low. The key study design decision is not mentioned in the release.

The story says that subjects \u201cmaintained their pre-study dietary and exercise regimens\u201d while they lost the weight. Though the study doesn\u2019t say exactly, presumably this means that most subjects were overeating and not exercising very much, since the subjects entering the study were described as \u201coverweight and obese.\u201d But in a press release issued about the study, the lead author suggests that the subjects may have been \u201ceating a low-fat, healthful diet and exercising regularly\u201d during the study. That sounds more like the kind of approach that might lead you to lose 11% of your bodyweight after 6 months, regardless of whether you were taking a coffee bean extract.\nThe upshot is we can\u2019t tell for certain what was happening in this study. What else were the subjects eating? Did they know they were taking an \u201cextremely bitter\u201d pill or a placebo? All questions that should be answered before trumpeting these results to the public.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "More: The hidden side of dementia: Families fight over care, end-of-life decisions, finances, estates\n\nDementia is a term used to broadly describe symptoms of cognitive decline; Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia.\nIf the vaccine proves safe and effective in humans, it could slice the number of dementia diagnoses in half, the study's senior author told USA TODAY.\nDoris Lambracht-Washington, a professor of neurology and neurotherapeutics at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, said researchers believe the vaccine could extend lives by preventing the disease from developing.\nThe vaccine is one of several promising treatments aimed at reducing the buildup of those substances before they become deadly plaques and tangles in the brain.\nTesting in mice showed that the vaccine safely prevents the buildup of substances in the brain associated with the fatal disease, the team reported this week in the journal Alzheimer's Research & Therapy.\n", "question": "Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

To evaluate the long term effects of IVIG, participants were offered additional IVIG treatment at a standardized dose under an IRB-approved extension protocol.\nMethods: Subjects who participated in the Phase 2 study and consented to continuation of treatment were given IVIG (Gammagard, Baxter) 0.4g/kg/2 weeks beginning at post-enrollment month 18. Subjects returned for clinical evaluations at 6 months intervals. A battery of cognitive, functional and behavioral measures were administered at each visit. Adverse events were tracked throughout the study.\nResults: IVIG treatment was well tolerated. A total of 16 of the originally enrolled subjects received treatment through month 36. This included 5/8 originally treated with placebo, and 11/16 given IVIG at various doses from time of randomization. Subjects who were treated with IVIG 0.4g/kg/2 weeks for the full 36 months had the best outcome, with no decline in ADAS-Cog, CGIC, 3MS, ADCS-ADL, NPI or QOL measures at the 3 year endpoint. In contrast, subjects treated with placebo initially or IVIG at other doses declined significantly.\nConclusions: This is the first study to report long term stabilization of AD symptoms with IVIG treatment over a period of 36 months. Limitations of the study include the small number of participants and the biases inherent in an open label extension study.

Also, the story is somewhat misleading in how the data was evaluated. While the review included 15 studies with a combined 1,360 participants, it would have been useful to note that 13 trials (966 participants) analyzed the therapeutic benefit for zinc, while 2 trials (394 participants) evaluated its preventive effect. Furthermore, not all the trial results could be pooled due to the nonstandarized approach to reporting outcomes.

The tool may be promising, but only a sober evaluation of how well it works in human beings, checking its results, will tell us whether it will save more lives than we currently can or join the thousands of ideas that sounded good but didn\u2019t pan out.\nThe article alludes to prior research with RF and microwave technologies in detecting breast cancer. So what do we already know about this approach? Were the prior techniques effective but hampered by lack of speed and portability?\n While not a critique of the article, we\u2019ll point out that, for this technique to be compared to mammography, it will likely need evidence that it improves survival. Part of the challenge in breast cancer screening is distinguishing between cancer and \u201cpre-cancer\u201d (or \u201ccancer risk\u201d). The word cancer actually refers to a large, strange zoo of different abnormalities. Some grow slower than others, some never causing problems within a patient\u2019s lifetime. That means it can be hard to know the danger of an early finding from screening. Thus, in addition to knowing the benefits and harms, like the rate of false positives, we\u2019ll need to see if this tool used on a schedule makes groups of people live longer. It may some counterintuitive, but the answer isn\u2019t always a clear yes. This uncertainty was one of the embers in last year\u2019s firestorm over the new mammography guidelines.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "A new asthma drug being developed by Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals may help patients whose condition is not well controlled by existing medicines, according to the results of a small clinical trial released Tuesday.\n\nIn the 12-week study, the number of asthma attacks or other outbreaks of symptoms decreased by 87 percent in those getting the drug, dupilumab, compared with those getting a placebo.\n\nOther measures of lung function and disease control also improved, according to the study results, which were published online Tuesday in The New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the annual meeting of the American Thoracic Society in Philadelphia.\n\nDupilumab blocks the action of interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, two inflammatory chemicals made by the body that are believed to contribute to asthma.

", "explanation": "The HealthDay story started out with effusive quotes from the lead researcher. The Reuters story right away established that the findings were being met with criticism.

It says, \u201cThe new work looked at 933 women with colon cancer, whose average age was just over 70. The researchers then found a comparison group of women without the disease, who matched the first group in age, ethnicity and clinics where they received treatment.\u201d Unlike the HealthDay story, this story made note of a similar study that did not show the same level of benefit. It says, \u201cJacobs of the American Cancer Society added that one earlier study from the UK had found no link between bisphosphonate and colon cancer. Indeed, it found a higher risk of throat cancer in patients on the medication.\u201d The big problem with both stories, though, is that they both fail to point out that this study did not look at 933 women who took the drugs and 933 who did not. Of those 1,866 women, only 97 of the cancer patients took the drugs, and only 138 of the women without cancer had taken them. So, yes, the researchers were able to find what appears to be a statistically significant risk reduction, but they also found differences in physical activity, body mass index, vegetable intake and the use of statins and aspirin. The study highlights the biophosphonate connection, but the story should have explained why a difference of 41 women without cancer taking these drugs out of a total of nearly 2,000 would be enough evidence to get really excited about.\nAlso, evaluating the quality of the evidence requires acknowledging this type of study can only assess relative risk. It cannot provide an assessment of the absolute benefit of using the medicine vs. not using it. This is a key limitation of the study design. This type of study can only identify if a relationship may exist between the medicine and colon cancer. It can\u2019t say how big the effect is. That requires a different type of study. So evaluating the quality of the evidence involves acknowledging the relationship between the medicine and less cancer. This study cannot determine whether this relationship is \u201creal\u201d or truly measure the magnitude of the benefit. Here is where both stories fell flat by not discussing the huge limitations of trying to control for differences between women who took the medicine and those who didn\u2019t. We know that people who engage in preventive behaviors such as taking a bisphosphonate may also engage in other healthy behaviors that may relate to lower risk of cancer. So it may not be the bisphosphonate but rather another factor not controlled for that distinguishes patients who took the medicine from those who didn\u2019t.

If it is funded, it would start next year and take 18 months from then to bear results. Most of the evidence is in rats.\u00a0The study of 66 humans involved (in part) people already known to have brain injuries. FDA approval of the test is conditional on the completion (and funding) of the Defense Department study, which implies that the study is a late-stage, pivotal investigation of the technique in a clinical setting.\nThe trouble is, the article doesn\u2019t evaluate any of these points. Laboratory studies in rats and humans don\u2019t prove ideas but generate ideas. We don\u2019t know whether some future blood test will reliably identify serious cases that are missed by conventional techniques, change treatment plans, save lives, reduce long-term rehabilitation, or prevent what happened to Natasha Richardson. No one can say this technique will be better than what doctors already do, which is why the FDA won\u2019t touch it yet.\u00a0Not only do we not know the answer, we\u2019ve yet to ask the question.\u00a0None of the evidence mentioned has tested a diagnostic technique prospectively or compared it to another approach. \nThat context won\u2019t be clear for a lay reader, who won\u2019t see that the claims are\u00a0remarkably premature.\nThe presumably independent source, Dr. Hall, explains that \"the Banyan work\" does show\u00a0that these biomarkers can reliably track brain injury and are copious enough to be reliably detected.

In other words, we\u2019re not told what that number means.\nThe article is also vague about evidence from \"more than 300 human brain-injury patients\" regarding \"certain biomarkers.\" On its face, in a sea of rat research, that could be the highest-quality aspect of this evidence\u2026if we know anything about them. We presume from the detail about the study of 66 people that the 300 are all laboratory research. But of what biomarkers? All UCH-L1? Several other biomarkers of brain injury have been studied in the past. Which biomarkers would the DOD study look at \u2014 is it all about UCH-L1?

There was nothing in the study that would support conclusions about how to improve treatment or whether the results could be used to improve health outcomes, yet the story tells readers that the study points the way to such benefits. The story needed a nod to the fact that more research is needed to show that CAC scores can be used clinically to provide these health benefits. As the researchers pointed out, \u201cBecause we are presenting observational data, causality\u00a0with regard to influencing outcome cannot be inferred.\u201d\nThere was also no discussion of other study limitations.
