[{"article": "(CNN) By the time Cynthia Falardeau read about Alex Pring, a little boy who got a battery-powered robotic arm last summer, she had made peace with her son Wyatt's limb difference.\n\nHer premature baby had been born with his right arm tangled in amniotic bands. At a week old, doctors amputated his dead forearm and hand. They were afraid his body would be become infected and he would die. Falardeau mourned her boy's missing arm for years but, in time, embraced her son as he was.\n\nWyatt also learned to adapt. They tried a couple of prosthetics when he was younger and each time the toddler abandoned the false limb within months.\n\n\"His main interest was to create a shocking response from onlookers by pulling it off in the grocery store,\" Falardeau wrote on CNN iReport . In truth, she had been more concerned about getting him therapy for his autism-related delays -- the limb difference was secondary.\n\nSo when a friend shared a story from the \"Today Show\" with Wyatt in mind, about a team of University of Central Florida (UCF) students and graduates that made an electronic arm for 6-year-old Pring using a three-dimensional printer on campus, Falardeau was defensive.\n\n\"He doesn't need this,\" she thought.\n\nHer fifth-grader had a different reaction: \"I want one of these robot arms!\" Falardeau remembers Wyatt telling her and her husband. \"I could ride a bike! I might even be able to paddle a kayak!\"\n\nThere were other things the 12-year-old boy said he would do if he had two hands. A proper somersault. Clap with two hands. Dance with a pretty girl with one hand on her back and the other leading. Stuff she hadn't really thought about but he clearly had.\n\nFalardeau got in touch with the Orlando students through E-Nable , an online volunteer organization started by Rochester Institute of Technology research scientist Jon Schull to match people who have 3-D printers with children in need of hands and arms. The organization creates and shares bionic arm designs for free download at EnablingTheFuture.org that can be assembled for as little as $20 to $50. Middle and high school student groups and Girl and Boy Scout troops are among those donating their time and materials to assemble limbs for kids and give them to recipients for free.\n\n\"It's really just a step-by-step process of solving problems. The first problem we solved was: how do we make the hand move electronically? And then: how do we attach this arm to a child?\" said sophomore Tyler Petresky. \"It's just one problem after another we keep solving. That's what engineering is all about.\"\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about 1,500 babies in the United States are born with upper limb deformities each year. Comprehensive statistics aren't available for the number of children with amputations, such as Wyatt.\n\nThe UCF project started when Albert Manero, an engineering doctoral student, heard a story on the radio about one of the inventors of the 3-D printed hand. He got involved with E-Nable and met Alex, a local boy teased because of his missing arm, and set about designing a robotic replacement. They gave it to Alex for free.\n\nEach electronic limb takes about 30 to 50 hours to make and assemble. The students use the printer in the school's manufacturing lab and cover the cost of materials -- about $350 -- through donations.\n\nPetresky got involved with the design of Pring's hand because Manero knew he was good with electronics.\n\n\"He bribed me with some pulled pork sandwiches. I went over to his house and helped him out with electronics,\" he said. \"I found out he was working on an arm, and I thought that was the coolest thing in the world.\"\n\nEventually Manero moved to Germany for a Fulbright scholarship and left Petresky in charge of running the operations in Orlando.\n\nPetresky says they ask every family about the child's favorite color, superhero and interests, so the new limb can \"not just be a piece of plastic ... but be a part of them.\"\n\nAs they've designed the bionics, they've learned that kids don't necessarily want to blend in. Children have requested colorful designs inspired by superheroes, Disney's \"Frozen,\" and in Wyatt's case, the blue-skinned men from \"Blue Man Group.\" For Christmas, the group upgraded Alex's plain vanilla white arm to a new one resembling Optimus Prime from \"Transformers.\"\n\n\"We quickly found out this is much less about fitting in and feeling normal, and much more about expressing yourself,\" Petresky said. \"There's a large aspect of being artistic and being creative.\"\n\nThe team has made electronic arms for five children and are working with three more kids including Wyatt. He traveled with his mom to UCF last week and practiced flexing his muscle to make the hand open and close.\n\nHe expects to get fitted with his new arm later this month.\n\nHis mom, Cynthia, was most excited about seeing Wyatt being celebrated for who he is.\n\n\"The adoration of college students was an affirmation that money can't buy. He was wrapped in the joy of leading and advising students on how to help children like himself,\" she wrote in her iReport. \"Wyatt felt like he was making a difference for himself and other children.\"\n\nAs they got ready to leave the campus, her son told her he can't wait to see what he will accomplish with his new arm. And someday, he said, he wants to go to UCF and help other kids like him.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "While the story includes links to the groups developing these prosthetics, there is really no exploration of how easy it is to get one. Apparently the process involves finding a group of local volunteers, such as middle school students and Boy Scouts, who can assist with printing and assembling the limbs. Are these volunteers widely distributed throughout the country? Do they have the capacity to meet demand? We\u2019ll give the benefit of the doubt, but relying on such volunteer groups sounds like it could lead to disappointment, especially if the publicity from stories like this one leads to a surge in demand.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Yoga enthusiasts link the practice to a long list of health benefits, including greater flexibility and range of motion, stronger muscles, better posture and balance, reduced emotional and physical stress, and increased self-awareness and self-esteem.\n\nBut definitively proving these benefits is challenging, requiring years of costly research. A pharmaceutical company is unlikely to fund a study that doesn\u2019t involve a drug, and in any event, the research requires a large group of volunteers tracked over a very long time.\n\nThe subjects must provide health measurements at the outset, learn the proper poses, continue to do them regularly for years and be regularly evaluated.\n\nNo one knows these challenges better than Dr. Loren M. Fishman, a physiatrist at Columbia University who specializes in rehabilitative medicine. For years, he has been gathering evidence on yoga and bone health, hoping to determine whether yoga might be an effective therapy for osteoporosis.\n\nThe idea is not widely accepted in the medical community, but then, researchers know comparatively little about complementary medicine in general. So in 2005, Dr. Fishman began a small pilot study of yoga moves that turned up some encouraging results. Eleven practitioners had increased bone density in their spine and hips, he reported in 2009, compared with seven controls who did not practice yoga.\n\nKnowing that more than 700,000 spinal fractures and more than 300,000 hip fractures occur annually in the United States, Dr. Fishman hoped that similar findings from a much larger study might convince doctors that this low-cost and less dangerous alternative to bone-loss drugs is worth pursuing.\n\nThose medications can produce adverse side effects like gastrointestinal distress and fractures of the femur. Indeed, a recent study published in Clinical Interventions in Aging found that among 126,188 women found to have osteoporosis, all of whom had Medicare Part D drug coverage, only 28 percent started bone drug therapy within a year of diagnosis.\n\nMany of those who avoided drugs were trying to avoid gastrointestinal problems.\n\nOn the other hand, yoga\u2019s \u201cside effects,\u201d Dr. Fishman and colleagues wrote recently, \u201cinclude better posture, improved balance, enhanced coordination, greater range of motion, higher strength, reduced levels of anxiety and better gait.\u201d\n\nWeight-bearing activity is often recommended to patients with bone loss, and Dr. Fishman argues that certain yoga positions fit the bill.\n\n\u201cYoga puts more pressure on bone than gravity does,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBy opposing one group of muscles against another, it stimulates osteocytes, the bone-making cells.\u201d\n\nMost experts argue that it\u2019s difficult, perhaps impossible, for adults to gain significant bone mass. Undeterred, Dr. Fishman invested a chunk of his own money and with three collaborators \u2014 Yi-Hsueh Lu of The Rockefeller University, Bernard Rosner of Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, and Dr. Gregory Chang of New York University \u2014 solicited volunteers worldwide via the Internet for a follow-up to his small pilot study.\n\nOf the 741 people who joined his experiment from 2005 to 2015, 227 (202 of them women) followed through with doing the 12 assigned yoga poses daily or at least every other day. The average age of the 227 participants upon joining the study was 68, and 83 percent had osteoporosis or its precursor, osteopenia.\n\nThe 12 poses, by their English names, were tree, triangle, warrior II, side-angle, twisted triangle, locust, bridge, supine hand-to-foot I, supine hand-to-foot II, straight-legged twist, bent-knee twist and corpse pose. Each pose was held for 30 seconds. The daily regimen, once learned, took 12 minutes to complete.\n\nThe researchers collected data at the start of the study on the participants\u2019 bone density measurements, blood and urine chemistry and X-rays of their spines and hips. They were each given a DVD of the 12 yoga poses used in the pilot study and an online program in which to record what they did and how often.\n\nA decade after the start of the study, bone density measurements were again taken and emailed to the researchers; many participants also had repeat X-rays done. The findings, as reported last month in Topics of Geriatric Rehabilitation, showed improved bone density in the spine and femur of the 227 participants who were moderately or fully compliant with the assigned yoga exercises.\n\nImprovements were seen in bone density in the hip as well, but they were not statistically significant.\n\nBefore the study, the participants had had 109 fractures, reported by them or found on X-rays.\n\nAt the time the study was submitted for publication, \u201cwith more than 90,000 hours of yoga practiced largely by people with osteoporosis or osteopenia, there have been no reported or X-ray detected fractures or serious injuries of any kind related to the practice of yoga in any of the 741 participants,\u201d Dr. Fishman and his colleagues wrote.\n\n\u201cYoga looks like it\u2019s safe, even for people who have suffered significant bone loss,\u201d Dr. Fishman said in an interview.\n\nFurthermore, a special study of bone quality done on 18 of the participants showed that they had \u201cbetter internal support of their bones, which is not measured by a bone density scan but is important to resisting fractures,\u201d Dr. Fishman said.\n\nThe study has many limitations, including the use of self-selected volunteers and the lack of a control group. But all told, the team concluded, the results may lend support to Dr. Fishman\u2019s long-held belief that yoga can help reverse bone loss.\n\nEven if bone density did not increase, improvements in posture and balance that can accrue from the practice of yoga can be protective, Dr. Fishman said.\n\n\u201cSpinal fractures can result from poor posture, and there\u2019s no medication for that, but yoga is helpful,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition, \u201cYoga is good for range of motion, strength, coordination and reduced anxiety,\u201d he said, \u201call of which contribute to the ability to stay upright and not fall. If you don\u2019t fall, you greatly reduce your risk of a serious fracture.\u201d\n\nFor more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Yoga is everywhere (the phrase \u201912 important yoga poses\u2019 gives 6.2 million hits on google).", "answer": 1}, {"article": "We're sorry, but Newspapers.com doesn't work properly without JavaScript enabled.

And dietitians say too much chocolate can be harmful.\n\nStill, two of the three studies analyzed in the review provide yet another suggestion that health benefits lurk in chocolate, dark chocolate in particular, said review co-author Dr. Gustavo Saposnik.\n\nIf choosing among white chocolate, milk chocolate or dark chocolate, \"I'd definitely go with the dark chocolate,\" said Saposnik, director of the Stroke Research Unit at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto.\n\nThe review authors, who found three studies on chocolate consumption and stroke between 2001 and 2009, are scheduled to report their findings at the American Academy of Neurology's annual meeting in Toronto in April.\n\nOne study found no significant association between chocolate consumption and risk of stroke or death from stroke. But another found that the stroke rate was 22 percent lower in people who ate chocolate once a week, and a third reported that death from stroke was 46 percent lower in those who ate 50 grams of chocolate once a week.\n\nThe health benefit may come from antioxidants called flavonoids that are present in chocolate, Saposnik said. Antioxidants are thought to prevent cell damage.\n\nIn years past, \"the message was that chocolate consumption might be associated with higher LDL [bad] cholesterol or perhaps higher incidence of cardiovascular disease,\" he said. \"Today, we know that all chocolates are not the same.\"\n\nSo, should you and your sweetheart add dark chocolate to your diet? \"I'm not sure we can provide any recommendation at this time,\" Saposnik said.\n\nFor one thing, it's possible that some factor other than chocolate could be helping lower the risk of stroke. Those who eat more chocolate could be wealthier and have better access to health care, for instance, or go to the gym more often.\n\nSaposnik said more studies will help clarify the association between chocolate and stroke risk.\n\nFor now, said registered dietitian Katie Clark, \"caution should be taken not to promote chocolate as a health food,\" even though it's fine in moderation.\n\nChocolate is a major source of saturated fat, which raises bad cholesterol and boosts heart disease risk, said Clark, an assistant clinical professor at the University of California at San Francisco.\n\nBut Keith-Thomas Ayoob, an associate professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City who studies nutrition, said chocolate does have its benefits. \"Several studies indicate that even a little chocolate can help reduce blood pressure and increase blood flow through the arteries.

The current treatment is injection with the drug sumatriptan, but frequent use of the drug isn't recommended because of the risk of adverse effects. High-flow oxygen is also used to treat cluster headaches, but its use is limited because of a lack of good quality controlled studies.\n\nThis new study included 76 adult patients, aged 18 to 70, with either episodic cluster headache (57) or chronic cluster headache (19). During four cluster headache episodes, the patients alternatively received high-flow oxygen (inhaled oxygen at 100 percent, 12 liters per minute, delivered by face mask, for 15 minutes at the start of the attack) or placebo (high-flow air).\n\nThe study found that 78 percent of patients reported being pain-free or having adequate relief within 15 minutes of receiving high-flow oxygen, compared with 20 percent of patients after they received high-flow air. High-flow oxygen also provided better pain relief at 30 and 60 minutes.\n\nNo serious harmful side effects were reported after high-flow oxygen treatment, according to the report published in the Dec. 9 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\n\"To our knowledge, this is the first adequately powered trial of high-flow oxygen compared with placebo, and it confirms clinical experience and current guidelines that inhaled oxygen can be used as an acute attack therapy for episodic and chronic cluster headache,\" wrote Anna S.

Statins include widely used medications such as Crestor, Lipitor and Zocor.\n\n\"For high-risk people, those with heart disease or [who] have had a stroke who are taking a standard dose of a statin, further reduction in LDL cholesterol will give them extra benefit,\" said Dr. Colin Baigent of the Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit at University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, who was involved in both studies. This applied even if the patients already had low levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or \"bad\") cholesterol, he noted.\n\nThe reports are published in the Nov. 9 online edition of The Lancet.\n\nIn the first study, researchers at Oxford and the University of Sydney in Australia collected data from studies on 170,000 patients who took part in 26 trials. This type of review, called a meta-analysis, gathers data from various studies to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nAmong these trials, five compared high doses of statins with regular doses and the other 21 studies compared people taking statins with people not taking the drugs.\n\nThe researchers found that in trials comparing statin doses, taking high-dose statins reduced the odds of having a stroke by an additional 15 percent, compared to the usual doses of statins.\n\nSpecifically, there was a 13 percent reduction in heart-related death or heart attack, a 19 percent reduction in the need for a new heart operation and a 16 percent reduction in stroke, the researchers found.\n\nWhen they did an updated analysis of the 21 trials, first major cardiovascular events (such as heart attack and stroke) were lowered by a \"highly significant\" 22 percent for a 1.07 millimole per liter (mmol/L) reduction of LDL cholesterol.\n\nTaking all 26 trials together, deaths were reduced by 10 percent for 1 mmol/L in reduction of LDL cholesterol, with no significant effect on deaths from stroke or other vascular causes.\n\nIn addition, there were no significant effects of statins on deaths due to cancer or other non-vascular causes, and no excess risk of cancer, even at low LDL cholesterol concentrations.\n\nThe second study is a randomized trial called the Study of the Effectiveness of Additional Reductions in Cholesterol and Homocysteine (SEARCH), led by professor Jane Armitage, also a scientist at the CTSU in Oxford.\n\nThis trial looked at the benefits of statin therapy with 80 milligrams (mg) versus 20 mg simvastatin (Zocor) among 12,000 heart attack survivors.\n\nThe study was supported by a grant from Merck (manufacturer of the simvastatin).\n\nOver almost seven years of follow-up, those taking the higher dose statin had greater reductions in LDL cholesterol compared with those taking the lower dose.\n\nThe reduction in LDL cholesterol from the higher dose ended up decreasing the risk of a major cardiac event by 6 percent, the researchers found, although the statistic in itself was not clinically significant.\n\nThe researchers noted that the higher dose of Zocor (simvastatin) did result in a risk of a muscle disease 10 times higher than that associated with the lower dose. The muscle disease, known as myopathy, can cause pain, weakness, and in its rare but most severe form, destruction of the muscle tissue leading to kidney failure. Researchers found that two cases of myopathy occurred with the low dose and 53 cases with the higher dose.\n\nResearchers also found that rhabdomyolysis -- the most severe form of the muscle disease associated with statins -- was diagnosed in seven participants given 80 mg of Zocor (simvastatin), compared to none who were given 20 mg of simvastatin. Two died within a few weeks of developing the disorder, with one cause of death mentioning the muscle disorder as a contributing factor.\n\nResearchers also found that seven participants had creatine kinase levels higher than 40 times the upper limit of normal -- a possible indicator of kidney damage. For this reason, they noted that the incidence of severe muscle disease on 80 mg of Zocor might be an \"underestimate.\"\n\nBaigent noted this side effect is one associated with Zocor, but taking lower doses of other, more powerful statins may alleviate the problem. \"There are newer ways of increasing LDL cholesterol reduction by using the newer, more potent statins such a Lipitor or Crestor,\" he said. (All statins carry the risk of myopathy, but lower dosages are associated with a reduced risk.)\n\nBernard M.Y. Cheung, from the University of Hong Kong and coauthor of an accompanying journal editorial, said that \"people who are at risk from heart attacks and strokes should have their LDL-cholesterol lowered intensively.\"\n\nTheir doctors should consider prescribing a statin, either at a high dose or using a more powerful statin, he said.\n\n\"If you are at risk from a heart attack or stroke, either because you have had these conditions before or because you have the risk factors for them, you should be considered for intensive treatment to lower the LDL cholesterol,\" Cheung said.\n\n\"If your blood cholesterol is raised but you do not have other risk factors for heart disease and stroke, then your doctor may well decide that you do not need to take any drugs to lower cholesterol,\" he said. \"But if you are at risk from those diseases, you would need intensive treatment to lower LDL cholesterol, even if your LDL cholesterol level is not very high,\" he added.\n\nCommenting on the studies, Dr. Gregg Fonarow, American Heart Association spokesman and professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that \"despite the proven benefits of LDL cholesterol-lowering with statin therapy, many physicians have been reluctant to prescribe and patients reluctant to take higher doses of more potent statin medications due to concerns about side effects or safety.\"\n\nLowering LDL cholesterol by 50 to 60 percent with potent statins such as atorvastatin at 80 mg or rosuvastatin at 20 to 40 mg lowers the risk of major cardiovascular events by 50 to 60 percent, he said.\n\n\"Most patients tolerate higher doses of more potent statins equally well as lower doses of less potent statins,\" Fonarow said. \"Millions of patients with or at high risk of cardiovascular disease, who would derive additional cardiovascular protection from higher doses of more potent statins, are not currently treated with these agents. But [they] should be.\"\n\nFor more information on statins, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The class of medications, statins, discussed in the story are commercially available as indicated.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Patients generally sit in front of the light box, which can be as small as 9 by 11 inches and 5 inches deep, with the bright light emanating from the square surface, in the morning. \u201cWith the natural dawn being later in winter, the body rhythms drift late,\u201d Dr. Lewy said. \u201cIf you can fix the drift, you can fix the depression.\u201d\n\nLight therapy may even help with major nonseasonal depression, experts say, and with sleep disorders.

She told ABC's \"Good Morning America\" today she always hoped for a medical miracle.\n\n\"Since I was a child, I hoped that in America, one day maybe there would be a cure for my disease,\" she said.\n\nShe suffers from an inherited retinal disease called leber congenital amaurosis, which prevents the retina from processing light.\n\nThe medical procedure was developed by a husband-and-wife team \u2014 eye surgeon Dr. Al Maguire and gene therapy expert Dr. Jean Bennett. They said the treatment grew out of a simple question he asked her back in 1985.\n\n\"Could you take a gene \u2026 put a gene into a retina of a living organism?\" Maguire said, recalling the question. \"She said 'no problem,' which was probably oversimplified. But that's really where it started.\"\n\nMaguire says he practiced the procedure in a lab over 10,000 times before trying it on a human. He uses a needle the width of two eyelashes to deliver a virus carrying a healthy copy of the defective gene in the patient.\n\nThe virus is placed at the back of the retina of one eye.\n\nThe area treated is tiny, just three by three millimeters \u2014 about the size of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's cheek on a dime.\n\nBefore the surgery, Manuela said she would most like to see her family and friends' faces clearly, particularly her sister's. She was optimistic, but nervous, about the surgery.\n\n\"On the one hand, I was \u2014 of course \u2014 frightened, but on the other hand, they said let's try.\"\n\nShe has some blurred vision, but cannot read and had difficulty navigating a vision mobility course before the surgery.\n\nIn Manuela's case, Maguire was concerned about the damage already done by the disease to her retina. \"We were worried that there'd be too much scar tissue in the retina itself to be able to deliver the material to the correct spot,\" he said.\n\nBut after an hour, the surgery's results looked promising.\n\n\"It went perfectly,\" said Maguire. \"It was a great relief to get it done.\"\n\nTwo months later, it was time for follow-up assessments. Manuela's eyes were tested for visual acuity, pupil constriction and mobility. She showed encouraging improvement.\n\nBefore the surgery, Manuela's pupil gave no response to or recognition of light. After her surgery the difference was dramatic.

Nearly half the pregnancies among American women are unintended \u2014 unwanted now or within the next two years. And among sexually active teenagers and young adults, the rate of unplanned pregnancy is even higher.\n\nFully 43 percent of these pregnancies follow incorrect or inconsistent uses of contraception. Of course, some couples fail to use any contraception, but others rely on contraceptive methods that have significant failure rates even when properly used.\n\nThese facts prompted a committee of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists this month to urge its members to introduce women of all ages to the most effective and underused methods of reversible contraception: IUDs and hormonal implants. Once inserted, these long-acting methods remove the risk of patient error when a sexually active woman wishes to avoid pregnancy. Their effectiveness rivals that of sterilization.\n\nIn a 2012 study of 7,486 women aged 14 to 45, long-acting reversible contraceptives, or LARCs, were shown to be 20 times as effective in preventing pregnancy than the pill, contraceptive patch or vaginal ring. The risk of an unwanted pregnancy with these other methods was especially high among women under 21, whose rate of unintended pregnancy was nearly double that among older women.\n\nYet fewer than 10 percent of sexually active women currently rely on long-acting reversible contraception, and a major reason is doctors\u2019 reluctance to recommend them. Only about half of obstetrician-gynecologists offer the implant, the committee said, and many physicians use \u201coverly restrictive criteria\u201d when deciding whether to recommend an IUD, especially for adolescents and women who have not yet been pregnant.\n\nGreater LARC use can reduce birthrates among adolescents and, for women of all ages, a reliance upon abortion to prevent unwanted births, the experts wrote in the October issue of Obstetrics & Gynecology.\n\nFurthermore, the higher upfront costs of LARC methods are no longer an impediment for women with insurance obtained through the Affordable Care Act. Megan L. Kavanaugh, a senior research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, which studies reproductive health, said in an interview that \u201call new insurance plans obtained through the act\u2019s exchanges fully cover all contraceptive methods without any co-payments or other out-of-pocket costs.\u201d Title X family planning clinics and Planned Parenthood clinics are more likely than other sources to offer LARC methods, she said.\n\nIn a paper published two years ago, European experts predicted that \u201cafter decades of dominance by \u2018the Pill,\u2019 it is likely that in the future, long-acting reversible contraceptives will become the first-line contraceptive option, owing to their superior contraceptive effectiveness in real-life use, cost effectiveness as well as their established safety profile.\u201d\n\nHere is a summary of the advantages of LARCs, listed by the committee:\n\n\u25a0 They are independent of the sex act and do not depend on the user\u2019s motivation and reliability.\n\n\u25a0 Compared with other reversible methods, they are more effective and have higher rates of continued use and user satisfaction.\n\n\u25a0 There is no need to get frequent supplies and no additional costs once they are inserted, making them highly cost effective.\n\n\u25a0 There are few contraindications for their use, and fertility returns quickly after removal.\n\nFurthermore, the committee stated, \u201calmost all women are appropriate candidates\u201d for the LARC methods currently available. They are an implant that slowly releases the hormone etonogestrel over a period of three years, and four IUDs: the copper T that can be used for up to 10 years, and three IUDs containing the hormone levonorgestrel (two approved for use up to three years, and one approved for up to five years).\n\nIn real-world use, these methods are associated with a one-year pregnancy rate of less than one per 100 women. In contrast, women using the pill, patch or vaginal ring face an annual pregnancy risk of 9 percent; the diaphragm is associated with a 12 percent pregnancy rate, and with condoms, cervical caps and sponges, the rate is 18 percent.\n\n\u201cWhile there is no one best contraceptive method for every woman or every couple, women should have access to all methods and should know how effective the LARCs are,\u201d Dr. Kavanaugh said.\n\nThe etonogestrel implant is a small plastic rod resembling a matchstick that is inserted under the skin in the upper arm. The hormone, a form of progesterone, prevents ovulation and thickens the cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to reach and fertilize an egg. Though the implant can remain in place and effective for three years, it can also be removed sooner if, for example, a woman decides she wants to become pregnant. Typically with the implant, menstrual bleeding diminishes, and after a year, one woman in three stops having periods. However, some women develop longer, heavier periods, and some have increased spotting between periods.\n\nLikewise with the hormonal IUDs. Levonorgestrel, also a progesterone, changes the cervical mucus, blocking the transport of sperm and fertilization of an egg. It also suppresses growth of the uterine lining and thus reduces cramping and heavy menstrual bleeding. Women using it report a significant reduction in menstrual blood loss.\n\nThe copper IUD does not contain hormones. Rather, the copper is toxic to sperm, preventing them from fertilizing an egg. Because it also prevents a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus, the copper IUD can serve as emergency contraception for up to five days following unprotected intercourse.\n\nBoth the implant and IUD can be used by women who are breast-feeding, as well as those who cannot take estrogen. There are few contraindications; nearly all women are eligible for an implant or IUD, according to guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Unlike early IUDs no longer in use, \u201cmodern IUDs do not carry an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease after the first 20 days following insertion,\u201d Dr. Brooke Winner and her colleagues wrote in The New England Journal of Medicine. With both implants and IUDs, fertility returns quickly as soon as the devices are removed.\n\nCommon side effects include irregular bleeding during the first few months following the insertion of an implant or IUD. The latter is also associated with some cramping at the time of insertion.\n\u2022 The More We Learn on Nutrition, the More We Ignore\n\u2022 Ask Well: Catching Up on Lost Sleep\n\nFor more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "You could say this story was about availability itself, and especially about why things that are widely available are not prescribed by doctors more often.

Larotrectinib is the first cancer drug to receive FDA breakthrough therapy designation for patients with a specific fusion of two genes in the cancer cell, no matter what cancer type. The research appears in The Lancet Oncology.\n\n\"In some cancers, a part of the TRK gene has become attached to another gene, which is called a fusion. When this occurs, it leads to the TRK gene being turned on when it's not supposed to be and that causes the cells to grow uncontrollably. What's unique about the drug is it is very selective; it only blocks TRK receptors,\" said lead author Dr. Ted Laetsch, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics and with the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nLarotrectinib, targets TRK fusions, which can occur in many types of cancer. While the TRK fusions occur in only a small percentage of common adult cancers, they occur frequently in some rare pediatric cancers, such as infantile fibrosarcoma, cellular congenital mesoblastic nephroma, and papillary thyroid cancer, said Dr. Laetsch, who leads the Experimental Therapeutics Program (ETP) in the Pauline Allen Gill Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders at Children's Health in Dallas.\n\n\"Every patient with a TRK fusion-positive solid tumor treated on this study had their tumor shrink. The nearly universal response rate seen with larotrectinib is unprecedented,\" Dr. Laetsch said.\n\nAmong them was 13-year-old Briana Ayala of El Paso, who aspires to a career in fashion design. In 2016, Briana was found to have a rare tumor in her abdomen wrapped around her aorta, the largest artery in the body.\n\nSurgeons in her hometown said it would be too dangerous to operate, so her family brought Briana to Children's Health in Dallas, where UT Southwestern Professor of Surgery Dr. Stephen Megison had to remove portions of her aorta while removing most of the tumor.\n\nBut the cancer started to grow again and no further treatments were available.\n\nDr. Laetsch sent her tumor for genetic testing and found that Briana's cancer had the TRK fusion, meaning the new drug might help.\n\nBriana enrolled in the phase 1 clinical trial of larotrectinib and began taking the drug twice a day. Within weeks her pain and the swelling in her abdomen diminished, and scans showed her tumors had shrunk significantly.\n\nNearly two years later, Briana is back in school and playing with her dog, Goofy, and the family's seven parakeets. She's also been able to pick up her sketch pad and her dreams of a New York City fashion career.\n\n\"These are the kind of amazing responses we've seen with larotrectinib,\" said Dr. Laetsch, \"and this is why I'm so excited about it.\"\n\nThe results of the larotrectinib trial in adult patients - a 75 percent response rate - were published last month in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThe TRK-fusion mutation can be present in many types of cancers, including lung, colon, thyroid, and breast cancer, as well as certain pediatric tumors. TRK, short for tropomyosin receptor kinase, is a gene that plays a key role in brain and nervous system development and has a limited role in nervous system functions such as regulating pain in later life.\n\nLarotrectinib belongs to a class of molecules known as kinase inhibitors, which work by cutting back on the enzymatic activity of a key cellular reaction. The selectivity of the drug means it does not cause the severe side effects associated with many traditional cancer treatments, and none of the patients with TRK fusions had to quit the study because of a drug-induced side effect.\n\nEqually important, the response was long-lasting for most patients. \"For some of the targeted drugs in the past, many patients responded initially, but then resistance developed quickly. To date, the response to this drug seems to be durable in most patients,\" said Dr. Laetsch, who investigates the use of tumor molecular profiling to guide therapy in UT Southwestern's Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Division.\n\nA next step in the research is a clinical trial involving a similar drug for those patients who developed resistance. Dr. Laetsch will be the national leader for that clinical trial in children.\n\nThe larotrectinib research was supported by Loxo Oncology Inc., the National Institutes of Health, the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, and Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation.

After the patients died, their brains were shipped to Phoenix, where a pathologist sliced them into about 100 tiny pieces and sent them off for analysis of plaque.\n\nPathologists in Montreal analyzed the brain slices with a computer that counted plaques. Independently, pathologists in Chicago analyzed them the traditional way \u2014 by looking at the brain slices under a microscope and manually counting the microscopic plaques.\n\nMeanwhile, in Philadelphia, radiologists examined the scans and calculated how much plaque was present in the patients\u2019 brains and, independently, used a computer to analyze the amount of plaque in the scans.

EDT on APRIL 14, 2015) \u2013 An injection of stem cells into the eye may soon slow or reverse the effects of early-stage age-related macular degeneration, according to new research from scientists at Cedars-Sinai. Currently, there is no treatment that slows the progression of the disease, which is the leading cause of vision loss in people over 65.\n\n\u201cThis is the first study to show preservation of vision after a single injection of adult-derived human cells into a rat model with age-related macular degeneration,\u201d said Shaomei Wang, MD, PhD, lead author of the study published in the journal STEM CELLS and a research scientist in the Eye Program at the Cedars-Sinai Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute.\n\nThe stem cell injection resulted in 130 days of preserved vision in laboratory rats, which roughly equates to 16 years in humans. Age-related macular degeneration affects upward of 15 million Americans. It occurs when the small central portion of the retina, known as the macula, deteriorates. The retina is the light-sensing nerve tissue at the back of the eye. Macular degeneration may also be caused by environmental factors, aging and a genetic predisposition.\n\nWhen animal models with macular degeneration were injected with induced neural progenitor stem cells, which derive from the more commonly known induced pluripotent stem cells, healthy cells began to migrate around the retina and formed a protective layer. This protective layer prevented ongoing degeneration of the vital retinal cells responsible for vision.\n\nCedars-Sinai researchers in the Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) Core, directed by Dhruv Sareen, PhD, with support from the David and Janet Polak Foundation Stem Cell Core Laboratory, first converted adult human skin cells into powerful induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), which can be expanded indefinitely and then made into any cell of the human body. In this study, these induced pluripotent stem cells were then directed toward a neural progenitor cell fate, known as induced neural progenitor stem cells, or iNPCs.\n\n\u201cThese induced neural progenitor stem cells are a novel source of adult-derived cells which should have powerful effects on slowing down vision loss associated with macular degeneration,\u201d said Clive Svendsen, PhD, director of the Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute and contributing author to the study. \u201cThough additional pre-clinical data is needed, our institute is close to a time when we can offer adult stem cells as a promising source for personalized therapies for this and other human diseases.\u201d\n\nNext steps include testing the efficacy and safety of the stem cell injection in preclinical animal studies to provide information for applying for an investigational new drug.

But Tirpak's physician, Dr. Mary Laughlin, turned to something deemed medical waste until recently: umbilical cord blood.\n\nCord blood is rich in stem cells and easier to match than adult bone marrow because the immune cells are not developed. Also, patients can get the treatment in about three weeks -- as opposed to six to eight for bone marrow from an adult donor, said Laughlin, founder and medical director of the Cleveland Cord Blood Center.\n\n\"That can be a critical time interval for a patient who is in remission,\" she said, noting that doctors often fear a patient's relapse while awaiting the transplant.\n\nTraditionally, patients with leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma have first tried to find an adult bone marrow donor either from a close relative or from a national bone marrow registry. But the registry's more than 12 million donors meet the needs of only about 60 percent of Caucasians in the United States and only 5 to 15 percent of minorities, who are underrepresented. Even siblings are not a sure thing, with the chance of matching a brother or sister only 25 percent.\n\nNathan Mumford, who is African-American, tried to find a bone marrow donor after his leukemia was diagnosed not long after he graduated from college.\n\n\"We went through that process, and nobody had a match. Siblings are the best matches. My brother or my sister wasn't a match. My friends, aunts, uncles, cousins, nobody was a match. So, couldn't go that route,\" Mumford said.\n\nAt that point, Mumford said, his choices were to continue chemotherapy and live for, maybe, another year and a half. Or he could try a cord blood stem cell transplant.\n\n\"That was an opportunity,\" said Mumford, who survived Hodgkin's disease as a child. \"That was a chance for me to live. I'm not a quitter. I've never been a quitter, so I wasn't going to quit.\"\n\nMumford received a cord blood stem cell transplant in November 2004. In such transplants, patients have chemotherapy, radiation or both to kill the cancer cells and to suppress the immune system so that the new stem cells are not rejected. Then, the stem cells are injected into the patient's body and travel to the bone marrow cavities, where they create new, healthy marrow. Mumford, who's now 30, says he's never felt better.\n\n\"I just feel amazing,\" he said. \"I have a lot of energy, and I'm just excited about it.\"\n\nMumford lives in Cleveland and runs the Karen E. Mumford Foundation. The nonprofit, named for his mother, who died of breast cancer while he was being treated, provides emotional and financial assistance to cancer patients.\n\nTirpak and Mumford represent a growing number of patients taking advantage of stem cells from cord blood, which can be used in patients with leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma. Cord blood transplants among unrelated donors have risen from 1 percent in 2001 to 24 percent last year, Laughlin says.\n\nNationally, more than 200 hospitals accept cord blood donations. Parents must decide before birth whether to bank a child's cord blood. If they do, it's collected immediately after birth, processed, registered in a national database and kept frozen.

Currently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has only approved the medication for use by patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a chronic ailment that is a combination of bronchitis and emphysema.\n\nTreating asthma has never been a one-size-fits-all proposition, so \"having a new class of asthma medications could be potentially important,\" said lead researcher Dr. Stephen P. Peters, a professor of pulmonary, critical care, allergy, and immunologic medicine at Wake Forest University, in Winston-Salem, NC.\n\n\"People are different. Some people will respond to some medications, some respond to others,\" he said.\n\nThe report, funded by the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, is published in the Sept. 19 online edition of the New England Journal of Medicine. The journal is releasing the data early to coincide with its presentation Sunday at the European Respiratory Society meeting in Barcelona.\n\nFor the study, Peters' team tried three drug regimens on 210 asthmatics. These included: Spiriva plus an inhaled steroid; a double dose of the inhaled steroid; and an inhaled steroid plus Serevent, a long-acting beta agonist that relaxes the muscles in the airway.\n\nPatients stayed on each regiment for 14 weeks.\n\nThe researchers found that Spiriva plus an inhaled steroid was more effective than giving a double dose of steroids in improving breathing and controlling asthma for these tough-to-treat patients.\n\nIn addition, the combination of an inhaled steroid and Spiriva was not less effective than using an inhaled steroid plus Serevent, they said.\n\nThat's important, Peters said, because there have been some safety concerns raised about long-acting beta agonists. These drugs carry a note on their labels warning of the possibility of severe adverse events, including death, he noted.\n\nThe results need to be confirmed in a much larger pool of patients, Peters said, and he noted that the patients were not followed long enough to see if Spiriva was able to reduce the severity of asthma attacks and hospitalizations.\n\nIn addition, Spiriva's safety profile among asthmatics still needs to be studied, he said.\n\nBecause the drug is not yet FDA-approved for use in asthma, Peters was reluctant to recommend it for that use. \"My hope is that in three to five years we will have the drug approved for asthma,\" he said.\n\nDr. Shirin Shafazand, an assistant professor of pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, said that \"perhaps there is a role for Spiriva in these poorly controlled asthmatics.\"\n\nHowever, at this stage there is no definitive answer whether Spiriva should or shouldn't be used in asthma, she said.\n\n\"This is a good foundation to design a trial where you would look at Spiriva plus steroids versus doubling the dose of steroids in a large number of asthmatics who are poorly controlled and then you follow them long-term,\" Shafazand said, but right now there is no data on long-term efficacy and safety.\n\nFor more information on asthma, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The headline and early sentences establish that Spiriva is available for COPD.

That\u2019s because HPV \u2014 which causes changes in the cervix that can lead to cancer \u2014 may take a decade to progress to that point.\n\n\u201cNo test is perfect,\u201d said Philip Castle, an HPV expert at the American Society for Clinical Pathology in Chicago. But, he added, \u201ca single negative HPV test is very good at ruling out disease.\u201d\n\nEven when doctors use just a Pap test, Roland said, a woman who has had a few normal tests in a row can go two or three years before her next screening.\n\nFor the current study, she and her colleagues sent out questionnaires to a representative sample of about 600 office-based doctors and hospital departments around the country. They asked doctors and staff what tests they used for cervical cancer screening and presented them with three patient scenarios.\n\nIn those scenarios, a woman age 30 to 60 has had two consecutive normal Pap tests but no HPV tests; two normal Paps and a negative HPV test; or a negative HPV test but no recent Pap tests.\n\nIn all of those cases, guidelines recommend waiting three years before screening the patient again, the authors explain in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology. But for each scenario, between 67 percent and 85 percent of doctors said they would bring the woman back in a year.\n\nRoland pointed to the extra costs women may incur to get childcare and make it to the doctor\u2019s office \u2014 plus the costs to a strained healthcare system of ordering more tests.\n\nAnd any extra screening increases the chance of getting a \u201cfalse positive\u201d result on a test \u2014 meaning the test finds something that doesn\u2019t turn out to be cancer. In that case, women would need more invasive tests to rule out disease, Roland said, and risk \u201cundue harm\u201d from those procedures.\n\n\u201cSome of it is, don\u2019t go looking before you need to go looking because you\u2019ll find stuff that you\u2019d rather not find,\u201d said Castle, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nResults from a survey of the same doctors have shown that many also give the HPV test alongside Pap smears to women under 30 \u2014 which is not recommended, because HPV is common in young women and often goes away on its own (see Reuters Health story of July 4, 2011.)\n\nCastle said there could be a few reasons that doctors opt to screen women more often than is recommended. First, they might not know about the guidelines. But women may also be used to annual testing and ask for it themselves.\n\nIn addition, Roland added, some doctors might be afraid of missing very early cervical cancer and getting sued if they screen less frequently.\n\nBut if doctors and hospitals want to rein in spending and limit unnecessary risks, that attitude has to change, researchers agreed.\n\n\u201cWe need to shift toward the wellness visit as opposed to, \u2018You have to come in here every year for a Pap,\u2019\u201d Castle said.\n\nWomen should talk to their doctors about screening, especially if they think they are being screened too often, researchers added.\n\n\u201cA woman should know what test is being used,\u201d said Dr. Mona Saraiya, a co-author on the new study. \u201cOften a provider just does the HPV test\u201d without telling the patient. \u201cA woman should say, \u2018What screening tests are you doing on me?\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd if doctors want women to come back again next year, women should ask them why, Saraiya said.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The entire story was about cervical cancer screening being made TOO available too often.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "About one in 20 men is estimated to have Peyronie\u2019s, but figures are not precise because people with the condition tend not to discuss it publicly.\n\nAlthough the company selling Xiaflex will be Auxilium Pharmaceuticals of Malvern, Pa., the F.D.A. approval was a belated triumph for the drug\u2019s original developer, BioSpecifics Technologies of Lynbrook, N.Y., on Long Island. Founded in 1957, it struggled for decades to find uses for the product, almost going out of business before licensing the drug to Auxilium in 2004.\n\n\u201cIt sort of proves to people that if you really believe in a drug you should never give up,\u201d said Matthew Geller, a biotechnology investment banker who is a member of the BioSpecifics board.\n\nShares of BioSpecifics closed Monday at $27.61, up from $1 as recently as late 2006.\n\nSome people treated with Xiaflex in clinical trials for the Dupuytren\u2019s hand condition said it had made a big difference in their lives, and had allowed them to avoid painful surgery.\n\n\u201cWhen I looked down and saw my finger straightened out, I cried,\u201d said Kenneth Nelson, 65, of Indianapolis. \u201cIt was to me just like a miracle.\u201d\n\nXiaflex is an enzyme produced by a gangrene-causing bacterium, Clostridium histolyticum, which uses it to eat away the tissues of its victims. The enzyme, called collagenase, breaks down collagen, a major component of the body\u2019s connective tissue that is found in skin, tendons, cartilage and other organs.\n\nBut collagenase by itself does not cause gangrene. And there are times doctors need to break down collagen, such as when an excess builds up in the hand or penis, causing Dupuytren\u2019s and Peyronie\u2019s. The ailments are named for French surgeons who described the conditions in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nThe enzyme was first extracted from the bacteria around 1950 by Ines Mandl, a young biochemist at Columbia University. Edwin H. Wegman, a Long Island entrepreneur, learned about Dr. Mandl\u2019s work and set up a company called Advance Biofactures, which later became BioSpecifics, to turn collagenase into a drug.\n\nIn 1965, the company won approval of an ointment containing collagenase for use in removing dead tissue from skin ulcers and burns. The ointment, sold by licensees under the name Santyl, was a modest success, but the company never truly prospered.\n\nSo in the 1970s the company began developing what it thought would be a bigger money-maker, an injectable collagenase. It tested that drug for numerous uses, including herniated disks. Finally, in the early 1990s, two professors of orthopedics at the nearby State University of New York at Stony Brook suggested using the drug for Dupuytren\u2019s.\n\nThe professors, Dr. Lawrence C. Hurst and Marie A. Badalamente, injected the drug into the tails of rats, as a stand-in for human fingers. They found they could dissolve the collagen in tendons, making the tails floppy, without harming nearby nerves and arteries. Then they organized clinical trials in patients and got federal grants to help pay for the work. The professors and Stony Brook will share a royalty of one half of 1 percent of sales of Xiaflex for use in treating Dupuytren\u2019s.\n\nBut work was slowed by lack of money, and by 2004, BioSpecifics was about out of cash. In desperation, Ed Wegman\u2019s son Mark, a top computer scientist at I.B.M., called a childhood friend, Laurence Korn, who had been the chief executive of a successful biotechnology company now known as PDL BioPharma.\n\nWith Dr. Korn\u2019s help, BioSpecifics licensed the drug to Auxilium in a matter of weeks, receiving $5 million initially.\n\nAuxilium was interested because of Peyronie\u2019s disease. It already was selling a gel for men with low testosterone and had learned from urologists about the need for better treatments for bent penises.\n\n\u201cFrom talking with surgeons and patients who have Peyronie\u2019s, neither of them wants to do the surgery,\u201d said Will Sargent, a spokesman for Auxilium.\n\nTwo years ago, the drug giant Pfizer, which sells the erectile dysfunction drug Viagra, licensed the European rights to Xiaflex from Auxilium for an initial payment of $75 million. BioSpecifics got $6.4 million of that amount and will receive 8.5 percent of additional payments of up to $410 million that Pfizer might make.\n\nAuxilium sought approval for treating Dupuytren\u2019s first because it was easier to measure success in straightening fingers. But the company hopes to begin late-stage trials of Xiaflex for Peyronie\u2019s disease later this year. In a midstage trial, injections of Xiaflex into the collagen plaque in the penis reduced the curvature. But the drug did not reduce pain or discomfort during intercourse by a statistically significant amount.\n\nWhile collagenase itself is not patented, the companies do have patents on the use of the enzyme to treat Dupuytren\u2019s and Peyronie\u2019s. They are also shielded from competition for seven years under a federal law aimed at spurring development of drugs for rare, or \u201corphan,\u201d diseases \u2014 even though newer estimates suggest these two diseases are not as rare as thought when the drugs were given orphan status.\n\nAuxilium and BioSpecifics hope that the half-century-old collagenase might eventually become as versatile as Botox, another bacterial product. They are looking at uses that range from loosening up immobile \u201cfrozen shoulders\u201d to eliminating fat bulges and cellulite.\n\nWith its belated success, BioSpecifics has sold off its ointment business. It now has only five employees and a business of collecting a roughly 11 to 12 percent royalty on sales of Xiaflex.\n\n\u201cWe will be a cash machine going forward,\u201d said Thomas L. Wegman, the president and the other son of the company founder. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to pay for marketing.

On Feb. 2, the day the drug was approved, one BioSpecifics director sent an e-mail message to the others saying, \u201cWell done. Hope Ed is looking on.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Mandl, the biochemist who first isolated collagenase from the bacteria, is nearing 93.

The message can change but the stem is the same, and this peptide targets the stem of the hemagglutinin, that's why it's very efficient,\" he said.\n\nThe urumin peptide could be a novel treatment since it targets the hemagglutinin, unlike current drugs on the market which target other parts of the virus, resulting in less impact, Jacob said.\n\n\"It just blows it up.

Studies so far have come to conflicting conclusions as to whether vitamin E or other antioxidants may influence older adults\u2019 risk of dementia.\n\nHowever, the new study followed participants for a longer period than most previous studies on antioxidants and dementia. And it supports findings from some previous research that dietary vitamin E, in particular, might be related to a lower risk of dementia.\n\nResearchers have been interested in whether antioxidants like vitamins E and C and beta-carotene might help stave off dementia because, in theory, their actions might interfere with the process of brain-cell degeneration.\n\nAntioxidants neutralize unstable forms of oxygen called reactive oxygen species that can damage cells throughout the body. Reactive oxygen species are produced naturally in the body, as byproducts of metabolism; because the brain is an area of high metabolic activity, it is thought to be particularly vulnerable to accumulating oxidative damage over a lifetime.\n\nHowever, studies so far have come to mixed conclusions as to whether older adults with a high dietary intake of various antioxidants have a lower risk of dementia. And clinical trials looking at the effects of antioxidant supplements have found no evidence that they cut Alzheimer\u2019s risk.\n\nFor the new study, researchers led by Dr. Monique Breteler, of Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, used data from 5,395 adults age 55 and older who were dementia-free at the start of the study. At that point, they were interviewed about their usual diet habits, which the researchers used to estimate their intake of vitamins C and E and beta-carotene.\n\nOver the next decade, 465 study participants were diagnosed with dementia, including 365 with Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nAmong the one-third of men and women with the highest vitamin E intakes from food, 120 developed dementia.

The other patients were given a combination of four chemotherapy drugs, (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, fluorouracil and leucovorin) known as FOLFIRINOX. The treatments lasted for six months. The purpose of the study was to record the overall survival rates of each group.\n\nResearchers found that even though people on the FOLFIRINOX had a longer average survival rate of 11.1 months, versus the gemcitabine group with 6.8 months, the quality of life for patients on FOLFIRINOX was not as good.

But new tests for breast cancer risk mutations beyond the well-known BRCA genes would offer actionable information for many women and their doctors, a new study finds.\n\nThe BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations put women at high risk for breast, ovarian and other cancers, but mutations of other genes are believed to confer extra risk as well.\n\nEarlier this year, 17 genetic experts argued against testing for a wider panel of breast cancer-related gene mutations until they are proven to be valid and useful in clinical practice (see Reuters story of May 27, 2015 here: reut.rs/1TvOoDf).\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of controversy even among experts,\u201d said the senior author of the new study, Dr. Leif W. Ellisen of Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center in Boston.\n\nFor 15 years, at-risk women have only been tested for BRCA1 and 2, but many companies now offer multi-gene panels for 20, 25 or 30 other genes, Ellisen told Reuters Health.\n\n\u201cAre patients better off getting these much broader tests?\u201d he said. \u201cDoes it actually change what you would tell them to do in terms of screening, prevention, or risk management?\u201d\n\nAccording to the new results, at least for some women, it would change their clinical management, he said.\n\nSeveral of the authors of the new paper disclosed that they receive research funding, consult for or are employed by genetic testing companies like Myriad Genetics and Invitae Corporation.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2014, the study team did panel tests for 25 or 29 genes on 1,046 women who were referred for hereditary breast or ovarian cancer gene testing, but had tested negative for BRCA mutations. Most of the women had a personal history of breast or ovarian cancer already.\n\nThe researchers found that 40 women, or 4 percent of the total group, did have potentially harmful mutations in other genes. Of those 40 women, 26 had mutations carrying low to moderate risk of breast or ovarian cancer, eight had mutations associated with Lynch syndrome, which increases colon and ovarian cancer risk, and three had high-risk breast cancer genes.\n\nIncluding another 23 patients who were referred into the study at a late stage, there were 63 women positive for non-BRCA mutations. Of those, the researchers decided that 33 would have been considered for additional screening or prevention measures based on their results. And for many, family testing would be recommended for first-degree relatives, according to the report in JAMA Oncology.\n\nEven among all appropriate candidates who are sent for genetic testing, only nine percent will test positive for the BRCA mutations, so an additional four percent who have non-BRCA mutations is a significant number, Ellisen said.\n\nOften these additional women do not have a high risk of breast or ovarian cancer, but some do have a high risk of colon or uterine cancer, and would be referred for additional screening, he said.\n\nMultigene testing is not more expensive than testing for the BRCA mutations alone, he said.\n\nThough these results indicate that additional genetic screening is clinically useful, some genetic test results will be uncertain, and it can be psychologically difficult for patients to deal with this uncertainty, Ellisen said.\n\n\u201cWe do not advocate for broad population-based screening,\u201d he said. \u201cThe interpretation of these tests is not a simple color-by-numbers thing.\u201d The vast majority of uncertain genes will be benign, but a misinterpretation could lead a patient to a drastic, unnecessary surgical procedure, he said.\n\n\u201cMany cancer genetics experts have again urged caution, characterizing the use of multigene testing in the clinical setting as premature,\u201d Dr. Elizabeth M.

She wanted to be screened, and she knew just what kind of screening she wanted \u2014 a test that's so new, some women and doctors don't quite realize what they've signed up for.\n\nThis kind of test , called cell free fetal DNA testing, uses a simple blood sample from an expectant mother to analyze bits of fetal DNA that have leaked into her bloodstream. It's only been on the market since October 2011 and is not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration \u2014 the FDA does not regulate this type of genetic testing service. Several companies now offer the test, including Sequenom and Illumina. Insurance coverage varies, and doctors often only offer this testing to women at higher risk because of things like advanced maternal age.\n\n\"I think that I initially heard about it through family and friends,\" says Seitz. \"They had had the option of it given to them by their doctors.\"\n\nTo her, it sounded great. She didn't want an invasive procedure like amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling.Those are considered the gold standard for prenatal genetic testing, but doctors must put a needle into the womb to collect cells that contain fetal DNA, which means a small risk of miscarriage.\n\n\"I wasn't interested in going as far as getting an amniocentesis because of the risk associated with that,\" she explains, \"and so when I heard about this test, that was part of the reason that I was most interested in it.\"\n\nThis new way of testing fetal DNA seemed to have already become fairly common where Seitz used to live, in Washington, D.C. But she had recently moved to Alabama, and the clinic she went to there wasn't as familiar with it \u2014 although when she talked to her doctor, she learned the clinic had just had a visit from a company's sales representative.\n\n\"I think it was a fairly new test for them at that point, but she was interested in pursuing it further to see what needed to be done,\" Seitz says.\n\nSeitz got her blood drawn last July, becoming one of hundreds of thousands of pregnant women who've opted for this new kind of test instead of the more traditional, invasive ones. Doctors say the impact has been huge.\n\n\"Those of us in the field who do diagnostic procedures like CVS and amnio have seen a drastic decrease in the number of those procedures that are being performed,\" says Dr. Mary Norton, an expert on maternal-fetal medicine and genetics at the University of California, San Francisco. \"Places are reporting doing fewer than half the number of procedures that were being done previously.\"\n\nBut, she says, things have changed so quickly that it may be hard for doctors and patients to know what they're dealing with.\n\n\"It's still new and it's quite different than previous genetic testing that's been available,\" says Norton. \"It's quite a different paradigm, if you will.\"\n\nAn invasive test like amniocentesis or CVS lets doctors get a complete picture of the chromosomes and a solid diagnosis.\n\nUntil the new testing technology came along, the only less invasive option was for an expectant mother to get an ultrasound, plus have her blood tested for specific proteins. This can reveal if there's an increased risk of certain disorders, but it's not very accurate and produces a lot of false alarms.\n\nStudies have shown that the new fetal DNA tests do a better job, says Norton. They're less likely to flag a normal pregnancy as high risk.\n\n\"They're much more accurate than current screening tests, but they are not diagnostic tests in the sense that amniocentesis is,\" says Norton, \"and so I think that has led to some confusion.\"\n\nEven though the newer blood tests do look at fetal DNA, they can't give a definitive answer like an amniocentesis can because they're analyzing scraps of fetal DNA in the mother's blood that are all mixed up with her own DNA.\n\nNorton says when women get worrisome results from one of these new tests and are referred to her center, they sometimes don't understand why doctors are offering a follow-up amnio \"because they were under the impression that this was as good as an amnio.\"\n\nShe is concerned that some people might end a pregnancy without getting confirmatory testing and points to one study last year that found a small number of women did that.\n\n\"There's at least some evidence that it's happening to a greater degree than I think many of us are comfortable with,\" she says.\n\nThe tests are being used more and more widely. Some worry that the companies' websites and marketing materials don't make the limitations clear enough.\n\nBut Dr. Lee Shulman doesn't see it that way. He's an obstetrician and geneticist at Northwestern University in Chicago who has consulted for a couple of the testing firms.\n\n\"Patients need to understand that while this is better, it is not a diagnostic test, and I think the companies have done a great job in putting this material out,\" he says. \"Whether or not clinicians use this material and take it to heart and use it for patient counseling is a different story.\"\n\nHe says the technology is so new that a lot of doctors have no experience with it, and consumers need to understand that.\n\n\"If the patient, if the couple, are not getting the answers, not getting the information they feel comfortable with, they need to seek out prenatal diagnostic centers, maternal fetal specialists, clinical geneticists, who may have more experience,\" says Shulman.\n\nFor example, here's one thing that might turn out to be a little more complicated than would-be parents might expect. Along with screening for the common chromosomal disorders, companies offer parents the chance to learn their baby's sex \u2014 weeks before it's clear on a sonogram.\n\n\"Many women are very excited by the idea that as part of their blood testing, they could find out pretty definitively if the baby is a boy or a girl,\" says Dr. Diana Bianchi, an expert on prenatal diagnostics at Tufts University School of Medicine.\n\nWhat they may not realize, she says, is that the test will also determine whether there's something abnormal about the sex chromosomes.\n\n\"Approximately 1 in 700 pregnancies there's an extra X or extra Y,\" she says, noting that these are mild conditions that would normally go undetected, unless a woman had an invasive test like an amnio. Some babies with these conditions grow up into adulthood and never know they have them, unless they face a symptom like infertility.\n\nSeitz, in Alabama, thought it was a bonus that getting this new blood test would tell her if she was having a boy or a girl. But it actually didn't do that, because of a paperwork glitch.\n\n\"The box for sex got unchecked somewhere along the way, so we weren't able to find it out from the test,\" says Seitz, who learned from an ultrasound that she was having a girl.

This success in large animals holds considerable potential for a safe, effective and long-lasting new treatment in humans with the same bleeding disorder.\n\n\"Our finding has great clinical relevance for patients with factor VII deficiency,\" said study leader Paris Margaritis, D. Phil., a hematology researcher at the Raymond G. Perelman Center for Cellular and Molecular Therapeutics (CCMT) at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). \"These dogs have the type of mutation found in the majority of patients with this disorder, so this approach could lead to a sustained gene therapy in people.\"\n\nThe Margaritis team collaborated with University of North Carolina (UNC) scientists, led by Tim Nichols, M.D., professor of Medicine and Pathology at the UNC School of Medicine.\n\nFactor VII deficiency is rare, found in about one in 300,000 to one in 500,000 people. Because a gene mutation impairs normal production of a blood clotting factor, patients may suffer excessive bleeding in the central nervous system or GI tract, or after surgery or an injury. Female patients may suffer excessive menstrual bleeding.\n\nFactor VII (FVII) deficiency has a range of severity, with about 40 percent of patients having severe disease. They are most commonly treated with regular infusions of clotting factor. Unlike hemophilia, a better-known bleeding disorder that predominantly affects males, factor VII deficiency strikes males and females equally.\n\nGene therapy proposed for bleeding disorders involves introducing DNA carrying the code to produce the specific clotting factor lacking in patients. Researchers at CHOP and elsewhere have bioengineered an adeno-associated virus (AAV), which does not cause disease, as a vector to deliver DNA into cells where it can express enough factor to make the blood clot normally. Over the past 15 years, CHOP hematology researchers have performed clinical trials of gene therapy for hemophilia B that have helped define efficacy and dosing levels in humans.\n\nThe CCMT at CHOP houses a clinical-grade laboratory that manufactures gene therapy vectors, including the AAV vectors used in the current study. Margaritis, a member of the CHOP group long engaged in hemophilia research, currently leads a laboratory focused on factor VII deficiency as well as hemophilia.\n\n\"We developed a unique animal model of this disease after identifying dogs with naturally occurring factor VII deficiency,\" said Margaritis. \"Our investigations enabled us to design the corrective gene to insert into our virus vector in the current study.\"\n\nThe CHOP team collaborated with scientists at UNC who have a long-established colony of dogs for hematology research. Based on previous work by Margaritis, the UNC team identified dogs for this gene therapy study.\n\nNichols, the director of UNC's Francis Owens Blood Research Laboratory, characterized factor VII deficiency in four individual dogs. Using the AAV vectors supplied by Margaritis, Nichols injected the dogs with varying dosages and monitored their health outcomes and biological markers over several years.\n\nThe treated dogs had expressed levels of clotting factor VII that would be therapeutic in humans, with long-term stability. In one dog, the effects persisted nearly three years. Based on kidney function, liver function, and blood measurements in the dogs, the treatment was safe, and did not elicit unwanted immune responses.\n\nThe current study sets the stage for clinical trials in humans. This gene therapy may especially benefit young children with severe bleeding from factor VII deficiency, such as patients receiving care in CHOP's hematology program.\n\n\"This work is very exciting and promising,\" said Nichols, who added, \"The FVII-deficient dogs tolerated the initial gene therapy infusions very well and have had no adverse side effects over several years of follow up. In other related studies in dogs with hemophilia B, similar positive findings have translated to people with hemophilia B.\" Both Nichols and Margaritis agreed: \"The table is now set to propose clinical trials that would treat people who suffer from FVII deficiency.\"\n\nThe National Institutes of Health (grants HL064190 and HL63098), the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the Pennsylvania Department of Health supported this study. In addition to his CHOP position, Margaritis is a faculty member at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\"Sustained correction of FVII deficiency in dogs using AAV-mediated expression of zymogen FVII,\" Blood, published online Dec. 23, 2015.", "question": "Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The release makes clear that this treatment will not be available until human clinical trials are conducted.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "America's favorite dietary supplements, multivitamins, modestly lowered the risk for cancer in healthy male doctors who took them for more than a decade, the first large study to test these pills has found.\n\nThe result is a surprise because many studies of individual vitamins have found they don't help prevent chronic diseases and some have even caused problems.\n\nIn the new study, multivitamins cut the chance of developing cancer by 8%. That is less effective than a good diet, exercise and not smoking, each of which can lower cancer risk by 20% to 30%, cancer experts say.\n\nMultivitamins also may have different results in women, younger men or people less healthy than those in this study.\n\n\"It's a very mild effect and personally I'm not sure it's significant enough to recommend to anyone\" although it is promising, said Dr. Ernest Hawk, vice president of cancer prevention at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and formerly of the National Cancer Institute.\n\n\"At least this doesn't suggest a harm\" as some previous studies on single vitamins have, he said.\n\nHawk reviewed the study for the American Association for Cancer Research, which is meeting in Anaheim, Calif., where the study was to be presented on Wednesday.

Many of those were single vitamins in larger doses than the \"100% of daily value\" amounts that multivitamins typically contain.\n\nScience on vitamins has been skimpy. Most studies have been observational \u2014 they look at groups of people who do and do not use vitamins, a method that can't give firm conclusions.\n\nDr. J. Michael Gaziano, of Brigham and Women's Hospital and VA Boston, led a stronger test. Nearly 15,000 male doctors who were 50 or older and free of cancer when the study started were given monthly packets of Centrum Silver or fake multivitamins without knowing which type they received.\n\nAfter about 11 years, there were 2,669 new cancers, and some people had cancer more than once. For every 1,000 men per year in the study, there were 17 cancers among multivitamin users and more than 18 among those taking the placebo pills. That worked out to an 8% lower risk of developing cancer in the vitamin group.\n\nMultivitamins made no difference in the risk of developing prostate cancer, which accounted for half of all cases. They lowered the risk of other cancers collectively by about 12%. There also was a trend toward fewer cancer deaths among multivitamin users, but the difference was so small it could have occurred by chance alone.\n\nSide effects were fairly similar except for more rashes among vitamin users. The National Institutes of Health paid for most of the study. Pfizer Inc. supplied the pills and other companies supplied the packaging.\n\nThe main reason to take a multivitamin is to correct or prevent a deficiency, \"but there may be a modest benefit in reducing the risk of cancer in older men,\" Gaziano said.\n\nCancer experts said the results need to be confirmed by another study before recommending multivitamins to the public. These participants were healthier \u2014 only 4% smoked, for example.\n\nFor people who do want to take multivitamins, doctors suggest:\n\n\u2014 Be aware that they are dietary supplements, which do not get the strict testing required of prescription medicines.\n\n\u2014 Ask your doctor before taking any. Vitamin K can interfere with common heart medicines and blood thinners, and vitamins C and E can lower the effectiveness of some types of chemotherapy.

Finding the right treatment is critical to allow the restoration of healthy brain development and prevent negative outcomes like chronic depression, disability and suicide.\"\n\nUnfortunately, about 40 percent of adolescents do not respond to their first intervention and only half of nonresponders respond to the second treatment, according to the researchers.\n\n\"Standard antidepressant treatments do not work for everyone and take weeks to months to take effect, a time period when patients are at risk for continued suffering and suicide attempts,\" Cullen said. \"The field is in need of new treatment options.

The SelectMDx test can help predict the likelihood that clinically significant prostate cancer will be found by a biopsy.\n\nThe study published in The Journal of Urology, led by researchers at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, was designed to elucidate the cost-effectiveness of SelectMDx in a population of U.S. men with elevated PSA, a marker of prostate cancer risk. Researchers analyzed the impact of utilizing the non-invasive diagnostic test prior to prostate biopsy. The primary objective was to characterize changes in health outcomes, measured in quality-adjusted life years, and a secondary objective was evaluating healthcare costs.\n\nThe researchers found that incorporating SelectMDx resulted in an average gain of 0.045 life years, or approximately 16 days, in full health gained at a cost-savings of $1,694 for each patient undergoing biopsy. Extrapolating these data to a conservative estimate of 311,879 patients per year undergoing biopsy resulted in 14,035 life years in full health gained with an annual cost saving of more than $500 million for each cohort.\n\n\"This study demonstrated that routine use of SelectMDx to guide biopsy decision-making improves health outcomes and lowers healthcare costs associated with prostate cancer risk assessment in a population of U.S. men,\" said Dr. Matthew Resnick from the departments of Urologic Surgery and Health Policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN. \"We believe that this strategy improves the value of conventional risk assessment strategies through improvements in both quality and cost, the numerator and denominator of the health care value equation.\"\n\nEvery year, 1.3 million men in the U.S. undergo a prostate biopsy.i Although a biopsy is the only way to diagnose prostate cancer, the procedure is invasive and results in complications in 18 percent of patients, with 3 percent hospitalized for infection within 30 days.ii,iii,iv Common complications from a prostate biopsy may include bleeding, infection, sepsis/bacteremia, urinary symptoms/retention, and sexual dysfunction.\n\n\"While biopsy is the only path to prostate cancer diagnosis, no man wants to, nor should have to, go through the uncomfortable, costly procedure if it can be avoided,\" said Dr. Jan Groen, Chief Executive Officer of MDxHealth. \"We developed SelectMDx to help reduce unnecessary biopsies and now we have the data to show how we can both improve outcomes and save the system money.\"\n\nThe full paper is accessible via the online edition of The Journal of Urology.\n\nAbout SelectMDx\u00ae for Prostate Cancer \n\nSelectMDx for Prostate Cancer is a proprietary urine-based, molecular diagnostic test that offers a non-invasive 'liquid biopsy' method to assess a man's risk for prostate cancer. SelectMDx helps identify men at increased risk of harboring aggressive, potentially lethal, prostate cancer who may benefit most from a prostate biopsy and earlier detection. The test helps to reduce the need for MRI procedures and invasive prostate biopsies by up to 50%, thereby improving quality of life and lowering healthcare costs per patient. SelectMDx is available in the US and all EU member states. Since the introduction of the SelectMDx test in mid-2016, over 23,000 patients have been tested and 15 commercial contracts have been signed with US based insurance companies. The test has been included in the 2018 European Association of Urology (EAU) clinical guidelines.\n\nAbout MDxHealth\u00ae \n\nMDxHealth is a multinational healthcare company that provides actionable molecular diagnostic information to personalize the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.

It may also reduce your chances of dying from cancer, according to a study on long-term regular aspirin use and different kinds of cancer.\n\nYin Cao, an instructor in the Medicine, Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, presented the information Monday at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Washington.\n\nCao looked at data from over 86,000 women who were part of the Nurses' Health Study between 1980 and 2012 and over 43,000 men who were part of the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study from 1986 to 2012.\n\nOver that 32-year period, over 8,200 women and nearly 4,600 men died of cancer. The risk of death overall was 7% lower for women and 11% for men who took aspirin regularly, compared with those who did not. The risk of dying from cancer was 7% lower for women and 15% lower for men who took aspirin regularly, compared with those who didn't take a regular dose.\n\nThe strongest connection was with colorectal cancer: There was a 31% lower risk for women and 30% for men who were among regular aspirin takers, as other studies have showed. But it also lowered women's risk of dying from breast cancer by 11% and men's risk of dying from prostate cancer by 23%. Men's risk of dying from lung cancer was also lower.\n\n\"Evidence has been accumulating very rapidly showing aspirin works in reducing cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality,\" Cao said. \"It is good to remember, though, if a person wants to take a low-dose aspirin, especially if a person has had cancer, they will want to have an initial conversation with their doctor first.\"\n\nNot everyone can take aspirin, particularly if you are at high risk for ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding. Studies have showed an increased risk of both when taking a daily aspirin, but the benefit does outweigh the risk for most other people.\n\n\"There has been a great deal of interest in understanding the possible benefits associated with common drugs,\" Tamimi said in an emailed statement. \"This study found strong evidence that aspirin use may reduce cancer death. The study was well conducted and was able to control for a number of important confounders. Therefore the findings are believed to be very robust, and suggest that aspirin, which is widely available, cheap and has limited toxicity, has the potential to have widespread benefit on cancer mortality for breast, colon, lung and prostate cancer.\"\n\nStudies have also found that aspirin can help patients who have had (or are at high risk for) a heart attack or stroke, and of course it is a good drug to relieve pain. Even the ancient Egyptians used the natural form of it for pain relief centuries ago.\n\nCao hopes her study will continue to broaden the body of research to include cancer-related deaths overall. Next, her group hopes to study what specific groups may most benefit from this practice, particularly based on those individuals with varying cancer risk.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Aspirin is\u00a0widely available.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "Adding the monoclonal antibody drug trastuzumab--already used to treat certain breast cancers--to the chemotherapy regimen of women with a rare form of uterine cancer lengthens the amount of time their tumors are kept from growing, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine researchers conducting a small phase II trial of the regimen, testing its safety and value.\n\nThe results of the trial, published online ahead of print on March 27 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, show that the drug extended the length of time to tumor progression by four to eight months in the seven-year trial. The researchers say this may lead to new national guidelines for treating this cancer subtype, known as uterine serous carcinoma.\n\nUterine serous carcinoma makes up less than 10 percent of all cancers of the endometrium, or lining of the womb, diagnosed in the United States each year, but it accounts for more than a third of the 10,000 endometrial cancer deaths annually. The aggressive carcinomas often don't cause symptoms until they've begun to spread throughout the body. As a result, the average time that standard chemotherapy and surgical treatments can keep the tumor from growing or spreading--known as progression-free survival--is only about eight months.\n\n\"The fact that these tumors grow rapidly, but also have a propensity to spread to lymph nodes and other organs very early, is a double whammy for women,\" says Amanda Fader, M.D., associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and first author of the new study.\n\nFader and her colleagues knew that about 30 percent of all uterine serous carcinomas test positive for HER2/neu, a receptor protein that is also overexpressed in about 10 percent of all breast cancers. Trastuzumab binds to and blocks HER2/neu, keeping it from driving tumor growth, and has been shown to be effective in so-called HER2 positive breast cancers.\n\nFrom August 2011 through March 2017, Fader, Alessandro Santin, M.D., professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Yale University, and collaborators at 11 other cancer treatment centers in the U.S. randomly assigned 61 women with uterine serous carcinoma, being seen at the participating institutions, to receive either the standard chemotherapeutic regimen--a combination of the drugs carboplatin and paclitaxel--or those drugs plus trastuzumab. Some 41 of the patients had stage 3 or 4 uterine serous carcinoma--known as advanced disease--and 17 had recurrent uterine serous carcinoma. All tested positive for the HER2/neu receptor.\n\nAmong all patients, the 28 controls receiving only the standard carboplatin and paclitaxel combination had an average progression-free survival time of eight months, and the 30 who received trastuzumab in addition had an average progression-free survival time of 12.6 months. However, the difference was even more profound in the 41 patients with advanced disease, whose progression-free survival time went from an average of 9.3 months to 17.9 months with the addition of trastuzumab.\n\n\"Even an improvement of a few months may be quite meaningful for women with these cancers,\" says Fader, who is also affiliated with the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins.\n\nAmong patients with recurrent disease, progression-free survival time increased from an average of six months to 9.2 months. The difference, Fader says, may be that these patients have been heavily treated in the past, are more likely to have overall poorer health and are more likely to have mutated or heterogeneous tumors, or tumors with different levels of HER2 expression.\n\nFollow-up studies of the women who remain alive--who now number 35--continue, the researchers say, to track the impact of trastuzumab on overall survival time even after tumor progression. But the results of the trial, they add, were strong enough to warrant submission to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, which guides the design of standard treatment plans around the country.\n\nFader cautions that a larger study of the drug combination, or other combinations, is needed to confirm the findings and potentially extend survival even more. She notes that using trastuzumab to selectively treat uterine serous carcinoma that express HER2/neu is part of a broader trend at Johns Hopkins and other cancer centers to use the tools of tailored therapy, or precision medicine, based on the molecular and genetic makeup of tumors and patients.\n\nOther authors of the paper are Dana M.

Josephson, a sinus and allergy specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"Previous studies have been single-center studies, and this is a bigger study using multiple centers and using a fairly large population, so it further says sinus surgery is a really good thing to do if you need it.\"\n\nChronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) affects a sizable minority -- 14 percent to 16 percent -- of U.S. residents. The condition, marked by symptoms such as sinus pain and pressure, headache, stuffy nose and sneezing, can compromise quality of life more than even congestive heart failure, back pain or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the study authors said.\n\nEndoscopic sinus surgery has been performed in the United States since the mid-1980s, said Smith, who is director of the Oregon Sinus Center at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland.\n\n\"It's a minimally invasive type of surgery performed with a telescope that goes into the nostril,\" then basically snips away abnormal and interfering tissue while leaving normal tissue behind, Smith explained.\n\nSmith and his co-authors studied 302 patients with CRS from three academic medical centers, following them for an average of a year and a half after their surgery.\n\n\"These were patients who have chronic sinusitis so, by definition, they have at least three months of symptoms and they have evidence of an ongoing inflammation or infection of their nose and sinuses on either a CT scan or an examination of the nose and sinuses,\" Smith said.\n\nFollowing the surgery, about 76 percent of patients had \"clinically significant\" improvement in quality of life, as measured by various validated scales.\n\nPatients with worse disease at the outset seemed to fare the best after the procedure, as did those undergoing surgery for the first time.

Doctors would seek to rid patients' bodies of chemicals and boost their immune systems through natural means such as nutritional supplements and dietary changes.\n\nBasically, it would be pushing a \"reset\" button on the child's body, with the hope of wiping autistic symptoms away.\n\n\"What we would like to do is have kids live in this wonderful environment where they are exposed to almost none of the Industrial Revolution. And we wonder, if the chemicals come out and the heavy metals come out, will the children start improving?\" Dr. Faber said.\n\n\"Will they start showing signs of clinical improvement, such as language improvement and socialization improvement? Will they become less obsessive? Less fascinated?\"\n\nAutism is one of a group of developmental disabilities disorders that cause substantial impairments in social interaction and communication and are characterized by unusual behaviors and interests. Many people with these disorders also have unusual ways of learning, paying attention and reacting to sensation. Rates have greatly increased in recent years, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, though some of the rise may be due to changes in reporting and diagnosing the disorder.\n\nPlanning and fund-raising for the \"Environmental Pediatric Room\" is in the early stages, with the Alcoa Foundation awarding an initial $200,000 grant April 28. It will require an estimated $500,000 to fully design and at least $1 million in yearly operating support its first three years.\n\nThe 106-year-old Children's Institute (formerly called the Rehabilitation Institute) plans to fund the room through the $30 million capital campaign it launched in 2005, after buying out its Shady Avenue site from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. It completed an expansion last year that doubled its building space and its capacity, from 39 to 82 beds. Almost $24 million of the campaign total has been raised, with fund-raising for the clean room and other programs ongoing.\n\nClean rooms are common in high-tech manufacturing and research environments and have been used in hospital settings for patients struggling with infectious diseases and transplants. They have also been used to treat children with autism, but only in patients' homes, largely in work by Virginia researcher and nutritionist Karen Slimak.\n\nDr. Faber noted that Ms. Slimak's clean room work -- like much of the research on toxicity in autism -- \"hasn't been written for the main [scientific] literature\" but instead has been written mostly for the Internet. The Children's Institute plan would be taking what is arguably a fringe movement into the mainstream: It would be the first autism treatment of this kind staged in an American hospital setting. It will be matched with scientific analysis, sensors and video cameras to study the real impacts of detoxification. The data and findings will be shared openly, he said.\n\nWith so many doubts -- and so few answers -- about effective autism treatments among the growing community of families affected by the condition, the institute said openness is vital to the experimental method's success.\n\n\"We're not saying this is the full cause\" of autism and related illnesses, Dr. Faber said. \"Obviously there are multiple causes, and there are going to be found many genetic causes, many environmental causes and many genetic-environmental interactions. But we wonder -- we speculate -- that it's possible if we have children living in a unique environment that has not [previously] been created scientifically that we can make a difference.\n\n\"We want to have it be very transparent to the world what we're doing. We want this to be basically an intellectual exercise that's shared with everyone.\"\n\nEducational, physical, speech and behavioral therapies have long been the traditional treatments for autism, but a growing number of families and researchers have called for further biomedical treatments as well, suspecting there is a chemical side to the disorder.\n\nFamilies often say their environmental suspicions about the disorder aren't taken seriously.\n\n\"I can give you a detailed account of how I know that exposure to toxic mold has caused my son's autism. I have been saying it for years and no one believes me. They think I am crazy, even a [Defeat Autism Now doctor] we once saw,\" said a message posted by a parent on the AutismWeb.com bulletin board in March\n\nParents \"research anything they can get their hands on and there are so many things saying 'Try this or try that' that aren't necessarily safe. It's a frightening thing,\" said Kim Aburachis, of Peters, who has twin 10-year-old boys, Nathan and Tyler, with severe cases of autism. Her boys have seen Dr. Faber for more than seven years and are likely to take part in the clean room treatment.\n\n\"We're so excited, so enthusiastic, just for the hope of this,\" she said.\n\nElliot Frank, the chairman of Pittsburgh's Advisory Board on Autism and Related Disorders, said the proposed clean room should not raise any red flags. Even if it does not work, patients will be in a safe and professional environment, benefiting from passive treatments such as nutrition and clean air.\n\nAmong parents of children with autism, Mr. Frank said, \"some will say, 'Come on, who are you kidding?' But a significant portion of parents will feel good about this and watch this with incredible interest. Others will watch and say, 'Hmm, let's see what happens.' \"\n\nDr. Faber, 49, is a neurodevelopmental and developmental behavioral pediatrician with 24 years in the field, who came to the institute four years ago from Mercy Hospital. He has been working on the clean room concept for at least two years, alongside Duquesne University chemistry professor and environmental expert Skip Kingston.\n\nHe has been trying to build the scientific case that environmental factors such as toxic chemicals do trigger autistic symptoms. His findings are complicated, but basically blood tests show 70 percent of his autistic patients have zinc deficiencies (pointing to problems with processing heavy metals), and the vast majority also have immune system problems of varying kinds.\n\n\"We know that the data for this is just emerging, but we feel it's a very safe intervention, and it's empowering for families and very reasonable,\" he said.\n\nThe room would house only one patient at a time and be similar to other spaces at the institute's Center for Autism, with educational and play spaces, and a table for dining. Medical staff, teachers and family would have regular access to the room through an air-locked entrance, and another air lock would separate the room from a kitchen and laundry area. There will be a small bedroom for the child and a couch for a family member to stay overnight.\n\nTraditional therapies would continue during the patient's stay. But by exposing children to a clean atmosphere and toxic-free diet, doctors will also try to slowly release chemicals from the children's bodies, through their skin, urine and stool. In the meantime they will be living in a space that is anything but hospital or scientific-feeling.\n\n\"To parents and children it's going to be the opposite of a sterile environment. It's going to be home,\" Dr. Faber said. \"If it's not beautiful and it isn't nurturant, it doesn't fit our research plans.\"\n\nAt the outset, patients would be only the sickest children, who have not responded to other treatments. They would stay six to 12 weeks, allowing an estimated four to six children to be treated per year. (Twenty families have already expressed interest.) After leaving, spaces at each patient's home would be equipped with lower-level clean technology, such as ultraviolet lights and air filters, and children would continue with special diets.\n\nA six-week stay is not uncommon at Children's Institute, said president and chief executive officer David Miles, as patients with traumatic brain injuries, often from car or bike accidents, can stay for months at a time. The average stay in its acute care unit is 23 days.\n\nStill, he said the room poses some unique challenges.\n\n\"Talking to architects, the technology to create the room is out there. It's not really a problem,\" Mr. Miles said. \"It's really what you put in the room that is an issue.\"\n\nEquipment and gear for use in industrial clean rooms are easy to find, but educational materials, toys and normal-looking furniture are not. Most will have to be fabricated from scratch, using the help of students at Duquesne's Bayer School of Natural and Environmental Sciences and other research teams. The institute also has to start from scratch on government permits, insurance issues and other red tape.\n\nFund-raising is the most obvious challenge facing the proposal. There is also the worry of raising expectations too high.\n\n\"We want to explore this hypothesis thoroughly,\" Dr. Faber said. \"But we can't promise we'll make any biologic difference or any kind of physiologic difference.

The British research found no negative effects of such light drinking on 5-year-olds whose mothers had imbibed while pregnant with them. Indeed, these kindergartners were slightly less likely to have behavioral problems and performed somewhat better on cognitive tests than children whose mothers had abstained. (More on Time.com: 5 Pregnancy Taboos Explained (or Debunked))\n\nBut this does *not* mean that light drinking in pregnancy is good for your baby. When researchers controlled for factors like maternal education and income, which tend to be higher in light drinkers, it significantly reduced the positive effects associated with alcohol. For example, before adjusting for these kinds of differences between the groups, the researchers found that light drinking was connected with 33% lower rates of overall behavior problems in boys \u2014 after the adjustment, that effect fell to 23%.\n\nThe study did find negative effects in children whose mothers drank moderately: this was defined as not having more than 3 to 6 British units of alcohol per week or more than 3 to 5 units on a single occasion. (One British unit of alcohol equals a small glass of wine.) Heavier drinking in pregnancy, not surprisingly, resulted in increased levels of behavior problems and lowered cognitive performance among children.\n\nThe research included 11,513 children participating in a large U.K. study. The authors had earlier published similar results looking at the data for children in the study when they were 3, finding those whose mothers who didn\u2019t drink had slightly more behavior problems and slightly poorer performance on mental tests than kids born to light drinkers; the results also showed increasingly negative effects of alcohol going from moderate to heavy drinking. Other research has repeatedly shown that heavy, binging patterns of consumption are most dangerous to the developing child. (More on Time.com: If I\u2019m Drunk, Then You Stepped On My Toes On Purpose)\n\nInterestingly, the new study parallels the effects of alcohol on health more generally; lighter drinkers tend to do better than teetotalers while the heaviest drinkers do worse. (But see here for coverage of a study that found even heavy drinkers beat abstainers when it comes to mortality in mid- to late life.)\n\nYet previous research in the area of maternal drinking has repeatedly found negative effects from even the lowest levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. This data is notoriously hard to interpret, however, in part because it is based on women\u2019s self-reports: the public health message against drinking during pregnancy has been so widely adopted that women who do drink may significantly underreport their consumption to researchers. If women who say they are drinking at \u201clight\u201d levels are actually drinking at moderately or heavily, that might make the data on light drinking look more dangerous than they are.\n\n\n\nWhatever the case, American health authorities remain united in their advice that no amount of alcohol is safe for the fetus during pregnancy \u2014 and anyone who is familiar with fetal alcohol syndrome knows why. But for those women who drink before finding out they\u2019re pregnant or who have an occasional glass of wine afterward, this study can provide reassurance that very low levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy are unlikely to cause serious problems.\n\nEven More Evidence for the Health Benefits of Drinking\n\nPhotos: What Booze Looks like Under a Microscope", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "This does not seem to apply here.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "Attaching curcumin, a component of the common spice turmeric, to nanoparticles can be used to target and destroy treatment-resistant neuroblastoma tumor cells, according to a new study published in Nanoscale.\n\nThe study, conducted in partnership by researchers at Nemours Children's Hospital and the University of Central Florida, demonstrates a potentially novel treatment for neuroblastoma, the most common cancer in infants.\n\n\"High-risk neuroblastoma can be resistant to traditional therapy, and survival can be poor. This research demonstrates a novel method of treating this tumor without the toxicity of aggressive therapy that can also have late effects on the patient's health,\" said Tamarah J. Westmoreland, MD, PhD, a pediatric surgeon at Nemours Children's Health System and senior author of the study. \"Unique approaches to target tumor cells with nanoparticle delivery systems hold promise for treatment of resistant tumors, such as the high risk neuroblastoma. We are hopeful that in the future, nanoparticles can be utilized to personalize care to patients and reduce the late effects of therapy.\"\n\nNeuroblastomas are cancers that start in early nerve cells and commonly form in the tissue of the adrenal glands, near the kidneys. About 700 new cases of neuroblastoma are diagnosed each year in the United States and most cases appear in children younger than 5 years old. High-risk neuroblastoma is hard to cure and is more likely to become resistant to standard therapies or recur. These cancers are also associated with late effects after treatments have ended, including developmental delays, hearing loss, or other disabilities.\n\nCurcumin has been shown to have substantial anti-cancer ability, but its low solubility and poor stability have made its use in medicinal applications challenging. Researchers from Nemours and UCF found that nanoparticles can be used to deliver curcumin to tumor sites.\n\n\"This shows that nanoparticles can be an effective delivery vehicle for cancer drugs,\" said Professor Sudipta Seal, who directs of UCF's NanoScience Technology Center and Advanced Materials Processing Analysis Center, and is a collaborator on the study. \"More research is needed, but we are hopeful it could lead to more effective treatment of this devastating disease in the future.\"\n\nIn the study, researchers loaded Cerium oxide nanoparticles with curcumin and coated them with dextran to test in cell lines of a high-risk form of neuroblastoma, known as MYCN-amplified, as well as non-amplified neuroblastoma. This formulation induced substantial cell death in neuroblastoma cells while producing no or only minor toxicity in healthy cells. Overall, the nano-therapeutic treatments showed a more pronounced effect in MYCN-amplified cells, which are traditionally more resistant to drug therapies.\n\nNanoscience research, which explores the unusual properties of materials at the nanoscale, has led to advancements in medicine, energy, information storage, computing and other fields.

Raji, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of radiology at Washington University's Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology. \"We showed that a single MRI scan can predict dementia on average 2.6 years before memory loss is clinically detectable, which could help doctors advise and care for their patients.\"\n\nAlzheimer's disease is a progressive, irreversible brain disorder that destroys memory and thinking skills. The disease affects 5.5 million Americans, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nNeurologists can get a ballpark estimate of a patient's risk of Alzheimer's dementia using the Mini-Mental State Examination questionnaire, or by testing for the high-risk form of the gene ApoE, which increases a person's risk of Alzheimer's by up to 12-fold. Both tests were about 70 to 80 percent accurate in this study. Other assessments, such as PET scans for plaques of Alzheimer's proteins in the brain, are good at detecting early signs of Alzheimer's disease, but available to few patients. PET scans cost thousands of dollars and require radioactive materials not found in a typical hospital.\n\nMRI brain scans are widely available and give doctors a glimpse into what's going on inside a person's brain. Raji and colleagues at the School of Medicine including Tammie Benzinger, MD, PhD, a professor of radiology, Parinaz Massoumzadeh, PhD, and Adedamola Adedokun, as well as radiologist Pratik Mukherjee, MD, PhD, of the University of California San Francisco, analyzed MRI scans for physical signs of impending cognitive decline.\n\nThey used a technique called diffusion tensor imaging to assess the health of the brain's white matter, which encompasses the cables that enable different parts of the brain to talk to one another.\n\n\"Diffusion tensor imaging is a way of measuring the movement of water molecules along white matter tracts,\" Raji said. \"If water molecules are not moving normally it suggests underlying damage to white tracts that can underlie problems with cognition.\"\n\nUsing information from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative - a multisite collaboration that pools data, funding and expertise to improve clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease - Raji and colleagues identified 10 people whose cognitive skills declined over a two-year period and matched them by age and sex with 10 people whose thinking skills held steady. The average age of people in both groups was 73. Then, the researchers analyzed diffusion tensor MRI scans taken just before the two-year period for all 20 people.\n\nThe researchers found that people who went on to experience cognitive decline had significantly more signs of damage to their white matter. The researchers repeated their analysis in a separate sample of 61 people, using a more refined measure of white matter integrity. With this new analysis, they were able to predict cognitive decline with 89 percent accuracy when looking at the whole brain. When the researchers focused on specific parts of the brain most likely to show damage, the accuracy rose to 95 percent.\n\n\"We could tell that the individuals who went on to develop dementia have these differences on diffusion MRI, compared with scans of cognitively normal people whose memory and thinking skills remained intact,\" Raji said. \"What we need now, before we can bring it into the clinic, is to get more control subjects and develop computerized tools that can more reliably compare individual patients' scans to a baseline normal standard. With that, doctors might soon be able to tell people whether they are likely to have Alzheimer's develop in the next few years.\"\n\nAlthough there are no drugs available yet to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease, identifying those at high risk of developing dementia within the next few years could still be beneficial, the researchers said.

Each year, almost 800,000 Americans suffer a stroke, and more than 140,000 die.\n\nAlthough many patients take drugs like statins and medicine to reduce their risk of stroke, surgical treatment of severe blockages in the carotid artery has been shown to be more effective than medical therapy alone in preventing ischemic strokes caused by a buildup of plaque in the arteries.\n\nThe Crest trial, sponsored by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke with additional financing from the stent maker Abbott Vascular, is one of the largest randomized clinical trials to study the two major procedures used to open blocked neck arteries and restore blood flow to the brain.\n\nIt included 2,502 patients at more than 100 in the United States and Canada, who were randomly assigned to receive either surgery or stenting over a period of nine years. Most of the patients had an artery blockage greater than 70 percent. The trial included patients who had suffered a stroke or a ministroke and those who were asymptomatic.\n\nThe death rate in the trial was very low, but risks varied depending on the procedure.

The hypotensive effect was dependent on time. The maximum systolic BP lowering effect of melatonin falls between 3:00 and 8:00 in the morning, the time of the highest risk of heart attacks and strokes. Nighttime and morning BP decreased more profoundly on average -8/3.5 mm Hg for SBP/DBP, respectively.\n\nMoreover, the higher the mean systolic BP was during the first week, the more it dropped on the second week of melatonin administration.

Berry, who works with the Division of Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.\n\nBut there's one notable exception to this success story \u2014 Hispanic women \u2014 and researchers think the reason may lie in a staple of their diet: tortillas.\n\nUnder current FDA rules, tortillas, corn chips and other foods made with corn masa flour can't be fortified with folic acid. So a coalition of groups including the March of Dimes Foundation and the National Council of La Raza has petitioned the FDA to change its stance and allow corn masa flour to be fortified with folic acid.\n\nAccording to the March of Dimes, about 3,000 pregnancies in the U.S. are affected by neural tube defects each year. The rates are highest among Hispanics: Latina women are roughly 20 percent more likely to have a baby with a neural tube defect compared to non-Latina white women.\n\nThe exact cause of this discrepancy isn't known. Researchers say there may be genetic factors that predispose the children of some Hispanic women to neural tube defects. But they suspect diet is also a factor: \"Part of the reason was that these groups just weren't consuming the same level of wheat flour products. Instead, they were consuming corn masa flour products, because that was the staple grain in that diet,\" says Cynthia Pellegrini, senior vice president of public policy and government affairs at the March of Dimes.\n\nResearch has shown that women who consume at least 400 micrograms of folic acid daily have a significantly reduced risk of having a pregnancy affected by neural tube defects \u2014 including spina bifida, which can involve paralysis, and anencephaly, in which large parts of the brain are missing. The catch: Folic acid is only protective if consumed in the earliest weeks of pregnancy.\n\n\"Most women, by the time they know they're pregnant, they've already passed that critical window,\" says Dean Appling, a biochemistry professor at the University of Texas at Austin. \"If they had a problem with folic acid, it would be too late at that point to prevent the birth defect.\"\n\nMandating fortification helps ensure that women are getting enough folic acid even before they know they need it. And studies suggest that fortifying corn masa with folic acid could prevent an additional 40 to 120 cases of neural tube defects among babies born to Hispanic mothers each year.\n\nSo why does the FDA currently ban dosing corn masa flour with folic acid? It all has to do with nixtamalization, the process by which tough corn kernels are softened by soaking in an alkaline solution, usually of slaked lime. The process, which hails from ancient Mesoamerica \u2014 what's now Mexico and Central America \u2014 dates back thousands of years. It renders the corn more pliable for grinding into masa flour and gives the masa its distinctive aroma and flavor.\n\nBut the FDA worries that this alkaline treatment could also \"affect the stability of added folic acid,\" the agency told The Salt in a statement. \"The FDA is concerned that the breakdown of folic acid in corn masa flour could yield a substance that raises concerns about safety.\"\n\nThe March of Dimes and others first petitioned the FDA to allow added folic acid in corn flour masa in 2012. As part of its review, the FDA asked the petitioning groups to study whether folic acid would stay stable in corn masa flour.\n\nThe petitioners filed the results of that study in October. Michael Dunn, the Brigham Young University food scientist who led the study, cannot comment on the test results while they're under FDA review, but he has previously called them encouraging. As The Seattle Times has reported, Dunn's early results suggested no loss of folic acid in fortified masa after three months of storage.\n\nThe March of Dimes' Pellegrini says she believes the FDA will respond to the results of Dunn's study later this month. But the FDA might have more questions related to the study before making a final ruling.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story explains that extra folic acid is already widely available in other flours.

The ideal study would randomly assign women to have mammograms or not. But, cancer experts said, no one would do such a study today when mammograms are generally agreed to prevent breast cancer deaths. In the study, which is continuing, women were followed for a maximum of 8.9 years. It is possible that benefits may emerge later.\n\nNonetheless, the new study is \u201cvery credible,\u201d said Dr. Barnett Kramer, associate director for disease prevention at the .\n\n\u201cThis is the first time researchers used real populations to compare the effects of treatment and mammography in the modern era of treatment,\u201d Dr. Kramer said. \u201cIt shows the relative impacts of screening versus therapy in an era in which therapy has been improving.\u201d\n\nDr. Otis Brawley of the said in a statement that the investigators used \u201ccareful methodology.\u201d The society, Dr. Brawley said, \u201cbelieves that the total body of the science supports the fact that regular mammography is an important part of a woman\u2019s .\u201d\n\nDr. Carol Lee, a radiologist at and chairwoman of the breast imaging commission of the American College of Radiology, said the new study affirmed that mammography saves lives.\n\n\u201cMortality from breast cancer is decreasing, and I have to believe that screening mammography has played a part,\u201d Dr. Lee said.\n\nIn their study, the investigators analyzed data from all 40,075 Norwegian women who had received a diagnosis of breast cancer from 1986 to 2005, a time when treatment was changing markedly.\n\nIn that period, 4,791 women died. And, starting in 1996, Norway began offering mammograms to women ages 50 to 69 and assigning multidisciplinary treatment teams to all women with breast cancer, similar to the teams at many major medical centers in the . The question was, Did the program of mammograms and optimal new treatment with coordinated teams of surgeons, pathologists, oncologists, radiologists and nurses lower the breast cancer death rate?\n\nThe investigators found that women 50 to 69 who had mammograms and were treated by the special teams had a 10 percent lower breast cancer death rate than similar women who had had neither.\n\nThey also found, though, that the death rate fell by 8 percent in women over 70 who had the new treatment teams but had not been invited to have mammograms. And Dr. Kramer said he knew of no evidence that breast cancer was more easily treated in women over 70 than in women ages 50 to 69.\n\nThat means, Dr. H. Gilbert Welch of Dartmouth wrote in an additional analysis in an accompanying editorial, that mammography could have reduced the breast cancer death rate by as little as 2 percent, an amount so small that it is not really different from zero.\n\nTwo percent is an estimate, Dr. Welch said. But, he said, whatever the effect of mammograms is, \u201call the signals here are that it is much smaller than we believed.\u201d\n\nDr. Laura Esserman, a professor of surgery and radiology at the in , said it tells her that \u201cif you get the same treatment and the outcome is the same if you find it earlier or later, then you don\u2019t make a difference when you find it early.\u201d\n\nAnd screening has a cost, Dr. Welch said. Screening 2,500 50-year-olds for a decade would identify 1,000 women with at least one suspicious mammogram resulting in follow-up tests. Five hundred would have biopsies. And 5 to 15 of those women would be treated for cancers that, if left alone, would have grown so slowly they would never have been noticed.\n\nWhen the study was planned, the scientists expected that screening would be even more effective than it was in studies from decades ago. After all, mammography had improved and, in Norway, each mammogram was independently read by two radiologists, which should make it less likely that cancers would be missed. The researchers expected mammograms to reduce the breast cancer death rate by a third.\n\n\u201cWe were surprised,\u201d said Dr. Mette Kalager, the lead author of the paper who is a breast surgeon at University and a visiting scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health.\n\nMarvin Zelen, a statistician at the Harvard School of Public Health and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who was a member of the research team said even though the mammography benefit is small, if he were a woman he would get screened.\n\n\u201cIt all depends on how you approach risk,\u201d Dr. Zelen said. His approach, he says, is \u201cminimax\u201d \u2014 he wants to minimize the maximum risk \u2014 which, in this case, is dying of a cancer.\n\nDr. Kalager came to the opposite conclusion. She worries about the small chance of benefit in light of the larger chance of finding and treating a cancer that did not need to be treated.\n\n\u201cSince I\u2019m a breast cancer surgeon, I know what being treated is like,\u201d she says. The decision to be screened, she says, \u201cis a matter of personal preference. Is it worth it to risk becoming a patient without it being necessary?\u201d\n\nMany women may still want mammograms, she says, and that is fine.\n\n\u201cI think we have to respect what women want to do.\u201d", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "\n\n\n\nThe availability of mammography screening is not at issue.

Lungs are clogged with a thick mucus, which can lead to lung infections. The disease also affects the pancreas, making it difficult for the body to absorb food, which significantly stunts growth and often leads to early deaths.\n\nThe researchers studied cases of children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis going back to the 1990s who received an injection of human growth hormone every day for six months to a year.\n\nIn the 1950s, children with cystic fibrosis generally died before age 8.

But in some individuals too many platelets are produced \u2013 a condition known as thrombocytosis, thought to affect about half a million people in the UK over the age of 40.\n\nResearchers say that raised platelet counts are as good a predictor of getting any cancer as a lump in the breast is for breast cancer.\n\n\u201cThis is a clue which can be used in practice by GPs to help them select patients for further investigation \u2026 most excitingly in some patients who may not already have other symptoms of cancer to achieve earlier diagnosis,\u201d said Sarah Bailey, co-author of the research from the University of Exeter.\n\nPrevious studies have suggested a link between thrombocytosis and various cancers, with recent guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence advising high platelet counts could be a sign of cancer of the oesophageal, stomach, lung or uterus.\n\nBut it remained unclear whether the condition could signal an increased risk of all cancers, and how it ties in with factors such as age and sex.\n\nWriting in the British Journal of General Practice, Bailey and colleagues report how they examined data from almost 50,000 individuals aged 40 or over who had been given a blood test by their GP. The patients were selected at random from a national database.\n\nIn total, over 31,000 patients found to have a raised platelet count, and nearly 8,000 without, were included in the analysis.\n\nWithin a year of the blood test, the team found that cancer was more common among those who had thrombocytosis: 11.6% of men and 6.2% of women were found to have cancer compared to 4.1% of men and 2.2% of women without a raised platelet count. In the general population about 1% of individuals over the age of 40 develop cancer each year.\n\nFor comparison, among women aged between 50 and 59 who have discovered a breast lump, the proportion who are found to have breast cancer is 8.5%.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe found cancer was more commonly diagnosed in men with raised platelet counts than it was in women with raised platelet counts and we believe that is because there are more causes of raised platelet counts in women that are not cancer,\u201d said Bailey.\n\nThe team add that cancer was more common among for those who had thrombocytosis for longer. Of the men who had a raised platelet count of the same value or higher six months after being diagnosed with thrombocytosis, 18.1% developed cancer, while for women the figure was 10.1%.\n\nWhile many different types of cancer were present in both groups, the team found that breast and prostate cancers were less common among those with thrombocytosis than in the general population, while lung and colorectal cancers were more common.\n\nFor about a third of cases of lung and colorectal cancer in patients with thrombocytosis, there had been no other symptoms that raised the suggestion of cancer. That, say the researchers, makes testing for raised platelet count a valuable tool, and could speed up cancer diagnosis by at least three months for thousands of patients a year.\n\nRichard Neal, professor of primary care oncology at the University of Leeds who was not involved in the research, welcomed the study.\n\n\u201cThis is an excellent study that demonstrates the potential for a commonly used blood test to identify some patients with cancer earlier,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis work should begin to change practice, so that GPs should be testing patients with raised platelet counts for cancer, especially those without other potential cancer symptoms,\u201d he added.\n\nDr Jasmine Just, Cancer Research UK\u2019s health information officer, said more research was need to confirm whether further tests following a high platelet count would save lives.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of possible reasons a person\u2019s platelet count might be high, and in most cases it won\u2019t be down to cancer,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cMeasuring platelet count in patients who don\u2019t otherwise warrant a blood test is not necessarily a good idea.

In 2013, about 2.8 million TBI-related emergency department visits, hospitalizations and deaths occurred in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of these are what are called mild traumatic brain injuries, or mTBIs \u2014 head injuries that don't cause a coma. People with an mTBI typically get better within a few weeks, but for as many as 20 percent, problems can linger for months or years.\n\nMany of these patients find themselves stuck with depression, cognitive problems, headaches, fatigue and other symptoms. Known as post-concussion syndrome, this phenomenon is often difficult to treat. Antidepressants can lift moods, painkillers can ease headaches and physical therapy may ease dizziness, but most researchers agree that these remedies don't heal the injury within the brain.\n\nCould oxygen do the trick? A growing group of scientists and physicians say that hyperbaric treatment, which exposes patients to pure oxygen at higher-than-normal air pressure, may work.\n\n\"These patients don't have enough oxygen to heal the injured parts of their brains,\" said Shai Efrati, a researcher and physician at Tel Aviv University in Israel and a leading hyperbaric scientist. \"Hyperbaric treatment massively increases the amount of oxygen available to the brain.\"\n\nBut other researchers believe that the treatment has no merit and should not be recommended.\n\n\"People want to believe that hyperbaric can fix [brain injuries], and it can't,\" said David Cifu, a researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, who has spent much of his career treating veterans with brain injuries.\n\nCompressed air has been used by doctors since the 17th century. In 1917, two German inventors first used pressurized pure oxygen to treat decompression sickness, which occurs when undersea divers return to the surface too quickly. For the past 50 years, hyperbaric therapy has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for non-healing wounds, carbon monoxide poisoning, burns and decompression sickness. Over the past decade, doctors in the United States and internationally have begun using it to treat mTBIs.\n\nMTBIs include sports-related concussions and head injuries caused by traffic accidents. Also, between 2000 and 2017, 308,853 American service members suffered mild traumatic brain injuries, according to the Department of Defense.\n\nPatients with an mTBI typically experience symptoms that include headache, dizziness, fatigue, depression, anxiety and cognitive impairment. Known as post-concussion syndrome (PCS), this phenomenon is difficult to treat. Doctors use antidepressants, pain medications, biofeedback and physical therapy, but these strategies do not always work.\n\nThe nature of the human brain makes it particularly susceptible to chronic injury. The organ requires large amounts of energy under normal circumstances, and even more to heal when injured. And often, the initial trauma damages blood vessels that supply the brain with oxygen. So, just as the brain needs extra resources, it faces an energy crisis. Often, Efrati and others say, injured brain cells don't die, but may persist for years or decades, alive but hobbled. Hyperbaric therapy, he said, can return them to full function, even years after the injury.\n\n\"Oxygen is different, because it has a direct biological effect on brain tissue,\" said Paul G. Harch, a physician in New Orleans who over the past three decades has used hyperbaric oxygen to treat hundreds of people with chronic brain injury as well as stroke.\n\nPatients typically receive between 40 and 60 hour-long hyperbaric treatments spread over two to three months. During each treatment, they sit or lie inside a hyperbaric chamber, which varies in size from a person-size tube to a large room that can hold several patients. While in the chamber, patients breathe in pure oxygen, typically pressurized to about twice the density of sea-level air; in this environment, the lungs take in about 10 times as much oxygen as under normal conditions.\n\nResearchers say it remains unclear how hyperbaric oxygen affects injured brains. Efrati and others argue that it probably works through several biological pathways. The extra oxygen appears to trigger the healing of brain cells, and switches on genes specifically related to brain repair. It increases the number of stem cells that migrate to sites of brain injury, promotes the growth of new blood vessels in the brain, and boosts the activity of mitochondria, which provide energy to cells throughout the body. Scientists have linked increased mitochondrial activity to healing in many kinds of tissue.\n\nEfrati said the brain is no different from any other part of the body. Pressurized oxygen has the power to repair many kinds of tissue damage. \"A non-healing wound in the leg and a non-healing wound in the brain,\" he said, \"they are the same basic thing.\"\n\nEfrati came to the field accidentally. Eight years ago, as director of research at Assaf Harofeh Medical Center in Tel Aviv, he was asked to oversee the hospital's small hyperbaric chamber. He knew little about hyperbaric medicine and wasn't especially interested in it. But he soon noticed that pressurized oxygen seemed to have an unexpected effect. A patient had come for treatment of foot wounds that wouldn't heal \u2014 a common symptom in diabetes. The man had also suffered a traumatic brain injury several years earlier, which left him unable to speak more than a few words. The hyperbaric treatment healed his feet \u2014 and also revived his ability to speak. Other patients with wounds and brain injuries had similar surprising results. He began to examine how hyperbaric treatment affects the brain, and this work has become his focus. In 2008. Efrati founded and now directs the Sagol Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and Research at Tel Aviv University and Assaf Harofeh, where he oversees and collaborates with a range of scientists and manages a large hyperbaric treatment facility.\n\nAs the use of hyperbaric therapy for brain injury has grown, it has become increasingly controversial. Critics argue that it remains unproven and that desperate patients are wasting thousands of dollars \u2014 the treatment typically costs between $200 and $400 per session and is rarely covered by insurance \u2014 on a technique that rarely if ever helps. Between 2009 and 2015, Cifu oversaw three studies for the Department of Veterans Affairs \u2014 reportedly at a taxpayer cost of about $70 million \u2014 of about 60 active-duty service members with post-concussion syndrome. The studies found that hyperbaric treatment had little effect on their symptoms.\n\nOverall, there is relatively little research on hyperbaric treatment for brain injury, in part because pressurized oxygen can't be patented, which limits its potential profitability. \"It's very difficult to get funding for studies on this topic,\" Harch said.\n\nA few studies besides Cifu's have looked at humans. In a paper published in October, Efrati and colleagues examined 15 post-concussion syndrome patients who had received hyperbaric treatment. Using brain imaging, the scientists found that after treatment, the subjects had increased cerebral blood flow as well as more activity in brain areas that had previously been dormant. They say that this indicates that hyperbaric treatment triggered regeneration of nerve fibers and blood vessels in the brain. In addition, tests showed that the subjects had improved memory and processing speed. In another study, published in 2015, researchers gave hyperbaric oxygen to 56 patients with prolonged post-concussion syndrome. They found that many patients showed significant improvements in cognitive function and overall quality of life.\n\nWhile the research remains inconclusive, some American doctors are using oxygen to treat chronic brain injuries.\n\nZiad Mirza is one of them. For most of his career, he dispensed hyperbaric treatment for hospitals around Baltimore. Two years ago, he became chief medical officer for Hyperheal Hyperbarics, a company with three clinics in the Baltimore area. Since then, he said, he has treated about a half-dozen brain-injury patients, with mostly positive results.\n\nOne of these patients is Parisa Cook, 29, who in 2016 was found to have a tennis ball-size tumor in her brain. Surgeons removed it, but the operation was not a complete success. Cook, who lives in Baltimore, began to suffer from debilitating symptoms: She had problems with her short-term memory; she had constant headaches and couldn't concentrate; her vision became blurry and dark; and her hearing was altered, so that all sounds were jumbled and very loud. Specialists told her the operation probably had caused collateral brain trauma.\n\nOver the course of a year, she went to eight doctors and tried more than a dozen medications and a variety of other treatments. Nothing helped. A policy analyst for the Maryland Department of Health, she worried that she would have to quit her job. She began to consider suicide. \"I felt completely hopeless,\" she said.\n\nThen Cook read about hyperbaric oxygen treatment. She got in touch with Mirza and began treatments. After a single session, she said, her vision was no longer wobbly; after 20 sessions over a month, she felt \"perfect.\" \"It was a complete 180,\" she said. \"This treatment saved my life.\"\n\nCook's primary-care doctor, Sujay Pathak, an internist in Baltimore, first saw her in February. \"Her life was totally interrupted by this. She couldn't function,\" Pathak said.\n\nBut a few weeks after starting hyperbaric therapy in September, she \"got suddenly and rather miraculously better,\" Pathak said.\n\nOf course, such anecdotes are not the same as rigorous scientific research. Efrati agreed that hyperbaric treatment requires more research. \"Definitely, we need more science,\" he said. \"We have a lot to learn. But we are seeing the results with our patients. It works, again and again and again.\"\n\nHyperbaric wound treatment, often for diabetics, is booming.

Currently, the standard treatment includes a combination of psychotherapy and prescription medications such as mood stabilizers and antipsychotics.\n\nHowever, an emerging field of research is exploring the use of probiotics--often thought of as \"good bacteria\"--as a potential new avenue for treatment of bipolar and other psychiatric mood disorders. And a new study from Baltimore's Sheppard Pratt Health System, conducted by a research team led by Faith Dickerson, finds that a probiotic supplement may reduce inflammation of the gut, which is known to exacerbate bipolar disorder. Probiotic organisms are non-pathogenic bacteria that, when present in the gut flora, are known to improve the overall health of the host.\n\nIn recent years, research has demonstrated a strong link between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. This connection, named the \"gut-brain axis\" (GBA), allows for crosstalk between the endocrine, immune, and autonomic nervous systems. The GI tract is also home to the intestinal microbiome, a complex population of roughly 100 trillion microorganisms (more than ten times the number of cells that make up the human body) that interacts with the mucosal lining of the GI tract. Studies have shown that the intimate association between the gut microbiome and GI tissue has a significant effect on the GBA.\n\nThere is also mounting evidence linking imbalances in the microbial species that make up the gut microbiome to a number of health problems including allergies, autoimmune disorders, and psychiatric mood disorders.\n\nIn the case of bipolar disorder and the GBA, previous studies have shown that inflammation, or overstimulation of the body's immune system, is a contributing factor in the disease. With this in mind, researchers developed a probiotic supplement aimed at reducing inflammation caused by microbial imbalances in the gut.\n\nA group of patients recently hospitalized for mania participated in a 6-month study to track the effects of probiotic treatment on both their mood and the status of their immune system.\n\nThe patients were randomly selected to receive either the probiotic supplement or a placebo in addition to their usual medications. The results showed that the group receiving the probiotic supplement, on average, didn't return to the hospital as quickly and required less in-patient treatment time compared to the placebo group. The beneficial effects were most pronounced in those patients who exhibited abnormally high levels of inflammation at the beginning of the study.\n\nOverall, these results indicate that changes in intestinal inflammation can alter the trajectory of psychiatric mood disorders and that modulating the intestinal microbiota may be a new avenue of treatment for patients suffering from these diseases.", "question": "Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The dosage and composition of the probiotic mixture used in this study are not clarified.

The apolipoprotein gene is inherited from each parent and when a patient inherits the ApoE4 variant from one parent they have a three times greater risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, whereas a patient who inherits ApoE4 from both parents is eight-to-12 times more likely to develop the disease.\n\nTo verify the accuracy of the biochip test, 384 samples were analyzed and results compared to those from a standard molecular diagnostic test. Researchers from Randox Laboratories collaborated with research colleagues at the Medical University of Vienna and found that results from the two tests were in 100% agreement. As biochip tests allow clinicians and researchers to quickly run multiple tests on one sample of blood, this new test is also faster and more affordable than the standard DNA test, producing results in only three hours. This enables doctors to predict the risk of an individual developing Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"Pairing this test with medical and family history for risk of Alzheimer's disease has the real potential to advance personalized medicine,\" said Harte. \"This fast, accurate testing will allow doctors and patients to make more informed choices earlier to potentially slow the possible progress of Alzheimer's.\"\n\nIn addition to this study, researchers will present the latest in Alzheimer's disease at the AACC Annual Scientific Meeting & Clinical Lab Expo, including:\n\u2022 New research explores using the level of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the brain and spinal cord as a biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease and AD. \"Cerebrospinal Fluid Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Activity Levels of Patients With Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease\" (A-118)\n\u2022 Researchers have shown that a specific protein in blood plasma could serve as a biomarker for early detection of AD. \"Plasma neuron derived exosomal protein biomarkers in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease\" (A-135)\n\u2022 A new meta-analysis of studies over 12 year suggests that a possible relationship between thyroid function and an increased risk of dementia. \"Higher FT4 or TSH Below the Normal Range are Associated with an Increased Risk of Dementia: a Meta-analysis of 10 Studies\" (A-180)\n\nSession Information \n\nRegistration for the AACC Annual Scientific Meeting is free for members of the media.

By contrast, two of those over 50 did, and late-stage polyps were almost twice as common in this age group.\n\nTo find a late-stage polyp, which may or may not turn into cancer, the researchers calculated they would have to test 23 of the people who were in their 50s.\n\nThat number was the same in younger people who had large waistlines, and even lower in those with metabolic syndrome, a combination of risk factors including belly fat, high blood pressure and high blood sugar.\n\n\u201cIt may be reasonable to offer colonoscopic screening to these individuals,\u201d Dr. Sung Noh Hong and colleagues write in the journal Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.\n\nOne gastroenterologist said the results were \u201cimportant\u201d but should not change practice.\n\n\u201cThis paper substantiates what we suspected, that people who are obese have higher risk of colon cancer,\u201d Dr. John Allen, a colon cancer expert and a community practice counselor with the American Gastroenterological Association, told Reuters Health.\n\nAllen, of Minnesota Gastroenterology PA, said this risk factor might be taken into consideration when deciding when to screen, but that so far more studies were needed before recommending colonoscopy at younger ages.\n\nDuring colonoscopy, the doctor inserts a slim, flexible tube into the rectum. A camera at the tip shows the inside of the gut, so that unusual cell clumps can be found and removed.\n\nAt this point, colon cancer screening is only recommended by the American Cancer Society and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in people under 50 if a first-degree relative developed cancer at a young age.\n\nIn younger people, it is unclear that the benefits of screening offset the risks. During widely used colonoscopy, for instance, bleeding or perforation of the colon may happen in rare cases.\n\n\u201cYou want to make sure that the advantages are going to outweigh the harms,\u201d said the American Cancer Society\u2019s Smith.\n\nColonoscopy, used in millions of Americans every year, is just one of many methods to detect abnormalities. There are cheaper methods such as testing stool for blood, Dr. Michael L. LeFevre, of the University of Missouri in Columbia, told Reuters Health.\n\nLeFevre, a member of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federally appointed expert panel, said the chances that a polyp turns into cancer is currently a matter of debate. As a result, he said, it is hard to know whether removing polyps in younger people would in turn lower their risk of getting cancer.\n\n\u201cIf we back screening down to age 45, does that affect mortality?\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a task force perspective, this article alone would not prompt us to look at the screening guidelines.\u201d", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Clearly colon cancer screening is available.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Calcium in the arteries of the breast predicts early buildup of plaque in the heart's arteries, and may improve risk assessment in many women, especially young women\n\nRoutine mammography--widely recommended for breast cancer screening--may also be a useful tool to identify women at risk for heart disease, potentially allowing for earlier intervention, according to a study scheduled for presentation at the American College of Cardiology's 65th Annual Scientific Session.\n\nData from this study show for the first time a link between the amount of calcium in the arteries of the breast--readily visible on digital mammography--and the level of calcium buildup in the coronary arteries. Coronary arterial calcification, or CAC, is considered a very early sign of cardiovascular disease. Importantly, the presence of breast arterial calcification also appears to be an equivalent or stronger risk factor for CAC than other well-established cardiovascular risk factors such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes. Earlier research had shown a link between breast arterial calcification and atherosclerotic disease--even heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular disease events, but researchers said these data provide a more direct relationship between the extent of calcified plaque in the mammary and coronary arteries, as well as a comparison to standard risk evaluation.\n\n\"Many women, especially young women, don't know the health of their coronary arteries. Based on our data, if a mammogram shows breast arterial calcifications it can be a red flag--an 'aha' moment--that there is a strong possibility she also has plaque in her coronary arteries,\" said Harvey Hecht, M.D., professor at the Icahn School of Medicine and director of cardiovascular imaging at Mount Sinai St. Luke's hospital, and lead author of the study.\n\nAll told, 70 percent of the women who had evidence of breast arterial calcification on their mammogram were also found to have CAC as shown on a noncontrast CT scan of the chest. For women under 60 years of age with CAC, half also had breast arterial calcification--an important finding as very few would be thinking about or considered for early signs of heart disease. There were even fewer false positives among younger patients; researchers said that if a younger woman had breast arterial calcification, there was an 83 percent chance she also had CAC.\n\nNotably, breast arterial calcification also appeared to be as strong a predictor for cardiovascular risk as standard risk scores such as the Framingham Risk Score, which underestimates women's risk, and the 2013 Cholesterol Guidelines Pooled Cohort Equations, which tends to overestimate risk, Hecht said. When researchers added 33 asymptomatic women with established CAD, breast arterial calcification was more powerful than both risk assessment formulas, which suggests the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis may be a more important indicator of heart disease than other risk factors.\n\n\"This information is available on every mammogram, with no additional cost or radiation exposure, and our research suggests breast arterial calcification is as good as the standard risk factor-based estimate for predicting risk,\" Hecht said. \"Using this information would allow at-risk women to be referred for standard CAC scoring and to be able to start focusing on prevention--perhaps even taking a statin when it can make the most difference.\"\n\nMultivariate analysis showed that early signs of a buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries were most strongly related to breast arterial calcification. While CAC was about two times as likely with advancing age or high blood pressure, it was three times more likely with breast arterial calcification.\n\n\"The message is if a woman is getting a mammogram, look for breast arterial calcification. It's a freebie and provides critical information that could be lifesaving for some women,\" Hecht said, adding he hopes these findings will prompt clinicians, who rarely report breast arterial calcification, to routinely report not just the presence or absence of breast arterial calcifications but also to estimate and note the amount.\n\n\"The more breast arterial calcification a women has, the more likely she is to have calcium in her heart's arteries as well. If all it requires is to take a closer look at the images, how can we ignore it?,\" he said.\n\nA total of 292 women who had digital mammography and noncontrast CT scans within one year were included in the study. Of these, 124, or 42.5 percent, were found to have evidence of breast arterial calcification. Mammograms were reviewed by a second radiologist who was blinded to the CAC results. Women with breast arterial calcification were more likely to be older, have high blood pressure and chronic kidney disease, and less likely smokers. Women with established cardiovascular diseases were excluded. Breast arterial calcification was evaluated on a scale from zero to 12 by increasing severity, and CAC was measured on the CT using a validated 0-12 severity score. The overall accuracy of breast arterial calcification for the presence of CAC was 70 percent, and 63 percent of those with CAC also had breast arterial calcification.\n\nTo date, there is no consensus on using CAC as a screening test, though a very large outcome study of 39,000 subjects is underway in the Netherlands. Mammography, however, is widely used and accepted and, as Hecht said, may provide an opportunity to risk stratify asymptomatic women by breast arterial calcification who might have calcium in the coronary arteries and ordinarily would not have been readily considered for cardiovascular screening.\n\nHeart disease is the leading cause of death among women, yet breast cancer is often the most feared.\n\nRoughly 37 million mammograms are performed annually in the U.S. Mammography is recommended annually for women over 40 years of age by the American Cancer Society and every other year for women 50-75 years old and women at high risk for breast cancer by the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force. Digital mammography is more sensitive to the presence of calcifications and is now available in 96 percent of mammography units in the U.S.\n\nAnother intriguing point that deserves additional study, according to the researchers, is that the nature of the atherosclerosis is different in breast arterial calcification and CAC, making it unclear why one should be related to the other.\n\nHecht stresses that these findings warrant further evaluation and validation in larger studies. Future prospective trials are needed to see what the prognostic significance of breast arterial calcification might be. Because the study involved women who received both mammography and CT scan for clinical indications, these women may have been more likely than the average woman to have coexisting conditions, although Hecht said these were unrelated to heart disease.\n\nThis study is being published simultaneously online in JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging.\n\nIn an accompanying editorial in JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging, Khurram Nasir, M.D., M.P.H., and John McEvoy, from the Center for Healthcare Advancement and Outcomes at Baptist Health South Florida, said that the report provides impetus to document breast arterial calcification in mammography reports, to improve education of primary care and radiology providers on the link with heart disease, and other actions to establish best practices for incorporating this research into care.\n\n\"Even by the conservative estimate of 10 percent, approximately 4 million women nationwide undergoing screening mammography will exhibit breast arterial calcification; with 2 to 3 million of them likely to have signs of premature coronary atherosclerotic disease,\" the authors said. \"Whether the best use of breast arterial calcification is to trigger additional testing or to directly inform preventive treatment decisions, either by flagging high-risk women to their providers or by reclassifying traditional (heart disease) risk estimates, is worth further discussion.\"\n\nThe study was funded, in part, by the Flight Attendants Medical Research Institute.\n\nThe study, \"Digital Mammography: Screening for Coronary Artery Disease?,\" will be presented on April 3, 2016, at 9:45 a.m. CT/10:45 a.m. ET/3:45 p.m. UTC at the American College of Cardiology's 65th Annual Scientific Session in Chicago.

In the study, only 21 percent of patients experienced a prolonged survival. Much more follow-up research is needed to better assess and hopefully improve the treatment's effectiveness, the researchers say.\n\n\"We have to be careful,\" says Annick Desjardins, a Duke neuro-oncologist who helped conduct the study. \"But we have long-term survivors. We are seeing something we don't normally see with patients with glioblastoma.\"\n\nDr. David Reardon, clinical director of the Center for Neuro-Oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, says the Duke group's results may represent \"a good, solid, important step forward\" for patients with no alternatives.\n\n\"Unfortunately, for most patients this is not going to be the answer yet,\" says Reardon, who used to work at Duke but wasn't involved in the new research. \"My fear is that every patient and family dealing with the devastating disease of glioblastoma is going to think the poliovirus is the cure. Unfortunately, the patients who are benefiting do reflect a relatively small percentage of the population.\"\n\nThe Duke results were published online Tuesday by the New England Journal of Medicine to coincide with their presentation at the 22nd International Conference on Brain Tumor Research in Norway.\n\nGlioblastoma is the most common and aggressive malignant brain tumor in adults. It's the cancer that killed former Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and former Vice President Joe Biden's son Beau. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is fighting glioblastoma.\n\nThe Duke researchers decided to try to use a genetically modified version of the poliovirus, which can cause a devastating form of paralysis, because of the virus's ability to infect nervous system cells.\n\nThe scientists removed one of the virus's genes to prevent it from causing polio and replaced that gene with one from a harmless virus known as a rhinovirus, which ordinarily causes the common cold.\n\nThe engineered virus was then infused directly into tumors in patients' brains with a tube inserted through a hole in the skull. The modified virus retains the ability to infect and kill brain tumor cells, and also appears to trigger the patient's own immune system cells to attack the tumors, the researchers say.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2017, the researchers treated 61 patients, trying various doses of the modified virus to determine which was safest and most effective.\n\nThere are substantial risks. The treatment can cause a dangerous swelling in the brain that can lead to seizures and other complications, the researchers found. One patient suffered a life-threatening blood clot in the brain that required surgery.\n\nBut overall, the median length of survival was 12.5 months for patients treated with poliovirus, compared with 11.3 months for a similar group of patients treated in the past, the researchers report. And starting at two years after treatment, the two groups' survival rate began to diverge, the researchers reported.\n\nAfter 24 months, 21 percent of the patients treated with the virus had survived compared with 14 percent of the historical comparison group. After three years, 21 percent of the poliovirus treated patients survived, compared with 4 percent of the other group, according to the researchers.\n\nTwo patients have survived more than six years, Bigner says. One has survived more than five years.\n\n\"You just don't see this percentage of long-term survivors with this disease,\" Bigner says. \"Those that have survived more than two years are in remission, and we expect them to continue to be long-term survivors.\"\n\nSome other researchers praised the results.\n\n\"We're extraordinarily encouraged by what we see with this data,\" says Mitchel Berger, chairman of neurosurgery at the University of California, San Francisco and director of its center for brain tumors. \"It's phenomenal.\"\n\nBut some cancer doctors caution that comparing the outcomes for patients receiving the virus treatment to what would have happened to similar patients in the past could produce misleading conclusions.\n\nThe Duke researchers have started a follow-up study combining the treatment with a chemotherapy drug to try to improve the results. They also plan to combine the treatment with other drugs, including some called checkpoint inhibitors, to harness the immune system to fight cancer.\n\nIn addition, the researchers are planning to try the approach on children with brain cancer, as well as other types of cancer, including melanoma and breast cancer. \"We believe we are going to be able to increase the results even more significantly,\" Bigner says.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story made clear this is an experimental therapy and thus not yet widely available.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The University of Texas at Arlington has successfully patented in Europe an implantable medical device that attracts and kills circulating cancer cells that was invented by a faculty member.

Surgical removal of cancerous tissue also can spur the spread of cancer in the body.

Lead author Stacey Kenfield, ScD, of UCSF, and a team of researchers at UCSF and Harvard, focused on this variant of prostate cancer to determine if exercise, diet and smoke-free status might have life-saving benefits.\n\nIn the study, published today, Nov. 17, 2015, in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, the researchers analyzed data from two U.S. studies: the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study that tracked more than 42,000 males ages 40 to 75, from 1986 to 2010; and a second, the Physicians' Health Study that followed more than 20,000 males ages 40 to 84, from 1982 to 2010.\n\nTo gage the effects of lifestyle habits, the researchers developed a score based on the results of the health professionals survey, then applied it to the physicians' study. They assigned one point for each affirmative response to questions about regular intense exercise that induced sweating, body mass index (BMI) under 30, tobacco-free status for a minimum of 10 years, high intake of fatty fish, high intake of tomatoes and low intake of processed meat.\n\nTo reduce error, participants had to be free of diagnosed cancer at the start of the study and a four-year lag was imposed to rule out those who unknowingly had lethal prostate cancer, which was determined by evidence of 'prostate cancer death or metastasis to the bones or other organs, excluding the lymph nodes.' Cases were confirmed through medical records and pathology reports, and cause of death was determined by death certificate and medical record, and secondarily by next of kin.\n\nThe researchers identified 576 cases of lethal prostate cancer in the health professionals' group and 337 cases in the physicians' group. Participants with 5 to 6 points in the health professionals' group had a 68 percent decreased risk of lethal prostate cancer and a 38 percent decreased risk was observed in the physicians' group for the same comparison. For dietary factors alone, men with three points, versus those with zero points, had a 46 percent decreased chance of developing lethal prostate cancer in the health professionals' group. In the physicians' group this decrease was 30 percent.\n\nWhile there were fewer cases and less detailed data collected in the physicians' study, the score was similar in both populations, indicating the potential benefit of healthy lifestyle habits in warding off lethal prostate cancer, said the authors.\n\n\"We estimated that 47 percent of lethal prostate cancer cases would be prevented in the United States if men over 60 had five or more of these healthy habits,\" said Kenfield, assistant professor in the Department of Urology at UCSF Medical Center, and formerly of the Department of Medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, where the study was initiated.\n\n\"It's interesting that vigorous activity had the highest potential impact on prevention of lethal prostate cancer. We calculated the population-attributable risk for American men over 60 and estimated that 34 percent of lethal prostate cancer would be reduced if all men exercised to the point of sweating for at least three hours a week,\" Kenfield said.\n\nThe researchers also calculated that lethal prostate cancer among American men over 60 would be cut by 15 percent if they consumed at least seven servings of tomatoes per week and that 17 percent would be spared this diagnosis if they consumed at least one serving of fatty fish per week. Reducing intake of processed meats would cut the risk by 12 percent, they reported. In contrast, the population-attributed risk for smoking was 3 percent, largely because the majority of older American men are long-term nonsmokers.\n\n\"This study underscores the ongoing need for more effective prevention measures and policies to increase exercise, improve diet quality and reduce tobacco use in our population,\" said senior author June M. Chan, ScD, from the departments of Urology, and Epidemiology and Biostatistics at UCSF. \"It takes co-operation and effort from multiple areas, like insurance companies, employers, policy makers and city planners, to figure out how to creatively support and encourage more exercise into most busy adults' working day. These lifestyle habits align with other recommendations to prevent diabetes and heart disease.\"\n\nAbout one man in seven will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during his lifetime, making it the most frequently diagnosed cancer in the United States, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer.

It concluded that these other groups perform about as well as 12-step programs.\n\n\u201cThis study suggests that these alternatives really are viable options for people who are looking for recovery support and don\u2019t like AA for whatever reason,\u201d Sarah Zemore, lead author of the study, told me.\n\nThe research is by no means the last word on this question \u2014 Zemore characterized the study as the beginning of a deeper evaluation into AA alternatives.\n\nBut this is important. There has been a good amount of research into AA and the 12 steps over the years, broadly finding that about a third of people maintain recovery from alcohol addiction due to 12-step treatment, another third get something out of the treatment but not enough for full recovery, and another third get nothing at all.\n\nResearchers have long suspected, though, that the benefits found in 12-step treatment programs are not exclusive to the 12 steps. As Zemore told me, \u201cThe benefits of 12-step groups are not driven by the 12 steps\u2019 specific philosophy or adherence to the 12 steps. It\u2019s really more about general mechanisms like abstinence motivation and social support for abstinence. Presumably, you could get those by participating in alternatives to AA.\u201d\n\nIn other words, these alternatives could help the one-third to two-thirds of people who don\u2019t get anything or much out of AA. That would help deal with a big public health issue: Based on federal data, more than 20 million people in the US have a substance use disorder, and within that group, more than 15 million have an alcohol use disorder. Excessive drinking alone is linked to 88,000 deaths each year. So finding the right solutions for this problem is literally a matter of life or death.\n\nThe study, conducted by the Alcohol Research Group at the Public Health Institute in California and published last month in the Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment, surveyed more than 600 people with alcohol use disorder (AUD), who were divided by which mutual help group they primarily participated in. Researchers followed up at six months then 12 months, measuring involvement in the groups and various substance use outcomes, including abstinence from drinking and alcohol-related problems.\n\nAfter controlling for several factors, the researchers concluded that \u201c[Women for Sobriety], LifeRing, and SMART are as effective as 12-step groups for those with AUDs.\u201d\n\n\u201cEssentially, that\u2019s the story,\u201d Zemore said. \u201cWe were really interested in whether the effects of involvement on recovery outcomes depended on which group [participants] were in. And we found that they did not.\u201d\n\nThere were some differences in the data. People who reported SMART as their primary group seemed to have worse substance use outcomes, and there were lower odds of total abstinence among LifeRing members.\n\nThat might have something to do with differences in recovery goals. For example, AA really emphasizes total abstinence from drinking as the solution to alcohol addiction. Groups like SMART and LifeRing, meanwhile, can be friendlier to the idea of members moderating their drinking but not quitting altogether. That could affect substance use outcomes \u2014 and especially abstinence outcomes.\n\nThe study\u2019s survey data suggests this is in fact what was going on: When researchers controlled for people\u2019s recovery goals \u2014 meaning, whether they wanted to commit to lifetime total abstinence or not \u2014 the differences between the 12-step groups, SMART, and LifeRing went away.\n\n\u201cThat suggests that people with less commitment to lifetime total abstinence are more likely to participate in SMART and LifeRing than they are to participate in 12-step groups,\u201d Zemore said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing these associations between SMART and LifeRing affiliation at baseline and worse recovery outcomes when you control for involvement.\u201d She added, \u201cBut I want to emphasize that these go away when you control for recovery goals.\u201d\n\nAgain, the study is not the final word. John Kelly, an addiction researcher at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the study, told me that the study is \u201cgood news, in general,\u201d but pointed out that it\u2019s limited by its methodology: It\u2019s based on an online survey, not the kind of randomized trial that\u2019s typically the gold standard in research. That may have led to some potentially biased results \u2014 perhaps participants in specific groups were less likely to report bad outcomes, for instance.\n\nAnd since it\u2019s only one study, it\u2019s possible that the results were biased in some other way. So it\u2019s up to future research to verify the findings.\n\nOne tricky thing with this line of research is you can\u2019t really force people to participate in certain groups \u2014 so studies that randomly assign participants to AA, SMART, LifeRing, or Women for Sobriety may not be easy to do. But there are ways that researchers could get around these problems, such as only using participants who are willing to try different groups and actively following up with them to make sure they are actually participating.\n\nAnother big research question: figuring out why, exactly, these groups might work to help people stay alcohol- or drug-free. There\u2019s good research into how AA works, but it\u2019d be good to figure out if SMART, LifeRing, and Women for Sobriety work in a similar way. That, Zemore said, will be one of her goals in future studies.\n\nWhy we need alternatives\n\nIn discussions about addiction treatment, AA and the 12 steps tend to prompt polarizing reactions \u2014 some people swear by the programs, others absolutely hate them.\n\nThere\u2019s a good explanation for that: While the research shows that 12-step treatment can be as effective as professional treatment modalities like cognitive behavioral therapy, the research also shows that the 12 steps don\u2019t work for everyone.\n\nAs one example, a prominent complaint about 12-step programs is the spiritual aspect. This is a big part of the 12 steps, with the final step even invoking \u201ca spiritual awakening.\u201d For people who aren\u2019t religious or spiritual, this can be a big turn-off; that\u2019s one reason SMART and LifeRing exist to begin with \u2014 they\u2019re meant to be secular alternatives to the 12 steps.\n\nThe good news is that the research suggests the spiritual aspect doesn\u2019t fully explain why the 12 steps are effective for some people. Instead, it seems other traits are just as, if not more, important \u2014 such as the social support that AA meetings provide and the lessons that participants can pick up at meetings.\n\nThat\u2019s long led researchers to suspect that alternative mutual help groups could work. If so, that would let some people go to AA meetings if they prefer the 12 steps, while others could find SMART, LifeRing, Women for Sobriety, or something else that works for them. Basically, everyone could find a workable solution.\n\nProviding these alternatives would essentially move addiction treatment closer to other kinds of medical problems. As Keith Humphreys, a drug policy expert at Stanford University, previously told me, \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything that works for everybody. There\u2019s very few places in medicine where you do.\u201d So there need to be as many alternatives as possible.\n\nThe US is far from that at the moment. Most treatment facilities in America are, according to the survey data and research, at least partly based on the 12 steps \u2014 making it the only option for many people. While alternatives like SMART or LifeRing do exist, they\u2019re not nearly as available as AA \u2014 and they certainly aren\u2019t built into professional treatment programs in the same way as the 12 steps.\n\nAs Albert, a pseudonym for an AA member in Georgia, previously told me, \u201cThere\u2019s just not a lot of widely advertised options available.\u201d AA and 12-step treatment are \u201cthe most well-known and most recommended option, so that\u2019s kind of where you tend to go.\u201d\n\nZemore\u2019s study begins to peel away at this problem. By showing that there really might be other effective options out there, the research provides hope that there may be a better \u2014 or at least more complete \u2014 solution out there for alcohol addiction.\n\nFor more on the research into AA and the 12 steps, read Vox\u2019s explainer.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story thoroughly addresses the gulf in availability between 12-step programs and alternative approaches.\nMost treatment facilities in America are, according to the\u00a0survey data and research, at least partly based on the 12 steps \u2014 making it the\u00a0only option for many people.

I have a \"mummy tummy,\" also known as \"mommy pooch.\" You know, that soft jelly belly you retain after having a baby \u2014 it makes you look a few months pregnant.\n\nI've tried to convince myself that the pooch is a valiant badge of motherhood, but who am I kidding? The pooch bothers me. And it turns out it has been causing back pain.\n\nSo when I hear that a fitness coach and doctor have come up with a technique that can flatten the pooch quickly and easily, I think, \"Why not?\"\n\nA few weeks later, I'm rolling out a yoga mat with a dozen other moms and pregnant women in San Francisco.\n\n\"We will see a dramatic change,\" says Leah Keller, who leads the class.\n\n\"You can easily expect to see 2 inches off your waist in three weeks of time,\" Keller says. \"That's not an unrealistic expectation.\"\n\nDecked out in purple yoga pants and leather cowboy boots, Keller is a personal trainer from New York City. She has developed an exercise that allegedly shrinks the mommy pooch.\n\nThere is science to back up the method, she says.\n\n\"A doctor at Weill Cornell and I did a study on the exact same program we're going to do,\" Keller says. \"And we found 100 percent of women achieved full resolution.\"\n\nOK! Wait a second. Two inches off my belly in three weeks? That sounds too good to be true. I decide to do a little digging into the science of mummy tummy and Keller's claim.\n\nIt turns out the jelly belly actually has a medical name: diastasis recti, which refers to a separation of the abdominal muscles.\n\nAnd it's quite common. Last year, a study from Norway reported about a third of moms end up with diastasis recti a year after giving birth.\n\n\"This is such a ubiquitous issue,\" says Dr. Geeta Sharma, an OB-GYN at Weill Cornell Medical Center-New York Presbyterian Hospital.\n\nAnd it's not just a cosmetic problem. Diastasis recti can cause another problem for new moms: lower back pain.\n\n\"People can start feeling some back pain because the core is weakened,\" Sharma says.\n\nIn rare occasions, the tissue in the abdomen isn't just stretched, but it is also torn a bit. This can cause a hernia, Sharma says.\n\n\"If there's a defect in a layer of tissue called the linea alba, then the bowel can poke through,\" Sharma says. \"That's going to be more dangerous.\"\n\nA hernia may require surgery. \"So I will refer patients to a general surgeon to have a CT scan if there's really a true concern about a hernia,\" Sharma says.\n\nDiastasis recti arises during pregnancy because the growing fetus pushes the abdominal muscles apart \u2014 specifically the rectus abdominal muscles.\n\n\"These are the muscles that give you a 'six pack,' \" says Dr. Linda Brubaker, an OB-GYN at the University of California, San Diego. \"People think these muscles go horizontal across the belly. But they actually go vertical from head to toe.\"\n\nThe rectus abdominal muscles should be right next to each other, on either side of the belly button, Brubaker says. \"There shouldn't be much of gap between them.\"\n\nBut during pregnancy, a gap opens up between the muscles, right around the belly button. Sometimes that gap closes on its own, but other times, it stays open.\n\nThat leaves a spot in the belly where there is very little muscle to hold in your stomach and other organs, a spot that can be 1 to 2 inches wide. That lets the organs and overlying tissue bulge out \u2014 and cause mommy pooch.\n\nTo flatten the area, women have to get those abdominal muscles to realign. And that is where the exercises come into play.\n\nIf you search online for ways to fix diastasis recti, you'll turn up a deluge of exercise routines, all claiming to help coax the abdominal muscles back together.\n\nBut the quality of much of that information isn't good, Brubaker says. \"Some of it is actually potentially harmful.\"\n\nEven some exercises aimed at strengthening the abdomen can exacerbate diastasis recti, says Keller, including simple crunches.\n\n\"You have to be very careful,\" she says. \"For example, please don't ever again in your life do crossover crunches or bicycle crunches. They splay your abs apart in so many ways.\"\n\nThat said, there are a few exercise programs for diastasis recti that many doctors and physical therapists support. These include the Tupler Technique, Keller's Dia Method and the MuTu System in the U.K.\n\nMost such courses, taught once a week for an hour in New York, San Francisco and at least a few other places, tend to run about four to 12 weeks and cost around $100 to $300. Some places offer online classes and videos, which are much less expensive.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also recommends abdominal exercises for the perinatal period. But the organization's guidelines don't provide details \u2014 such as which exercises work best or how often women should do them and for how long.\n\nPlus, ACOG focuses more on preventing diastasis than on fixing the problem; it recommends strengthening the abdomen before and during pregnancy.\n\n\"The best way is prevention,\" says Dr. Raul Artal, an OB-GYN at St. Louis University, who helped ACOG write its exercise guidelines for the perinatal period. \"The best way to do that is to exercise during pregnancy.\"\n\nBut, as Sharma, the Cornell OB-GYN, points out, no one has really vigorously studied these various exercises to see whether they actually fix diastasis recti.\n\n\"There's a general knowledge that exercise is going to help,\" Sharma says. \"But no one has really tested them in a standardized way.\"\n\nIn fact, the few studies that have been done haven't been high enough quality to draw conclusions, researchers in Australia said a few years ago.\n\nSharma hopes to change that. A few years ago, she teamed up with Keller to start to gather some evidence on her technique.\n\n\"We did a pilot study to see if the method is helpful for women,\" Sharma says.\n\nThe study was small \u2014 just 63 women. But the results were quite promising. After 12 weeks of doing Keller's exercise \u2014 10 minutes a day \u2014 all the women had fixed their diastasis recti, Sharma and Keller reported at ACOG's annual meeting few years ago.\n\n\"We had patients that were even one year out from giving birth, and they still had such great benefit from the exercises,\" Sharma says. \"We love to see that there is something we can do to help women.\"\n\nNow Sharma says she is working to put together a larger study to really nail down when the exercise works and how well.\n\nBack at the class in San Francisco, Keller is taking us moms through the key exercise. It's surprisingly simple to do.\n\n\"The exercise is a very small, very intense movement that's almost imperceptible,\" Keller says. \"OK. We're going to do another set.\"\n\nSitting on the floor cross-legged, with our hands on our bellies, we all take a big breath. \"Let the belly fully expand,\" Keller says.\n\nAnd then as we exhale, we suck in our belly muscles \u2014 as far back as they'll go, toward the spine. \"Now we're going to stay here near the spine. Hold this position,\" she says.\n\nThen we take tiny breaths. With each exhale, we push our stomachs back further and further.\n\nYou can do the exercise in several different positions, Keller says: sitting crossed-legged, sitting on your knees, standing with knees slightly bent, on all fours or laying on your side in the fetal position.\n\nThe key is to be sure your back is flat, and that you do the exercise 10 minutes each day, changing positions every two minutes or so. For the rest of the time, your belly is pulled all the way back into the spine.\n\n\"The fingertips on the bellybutton are really important for this reason,\" she says. \"So you know that you're squeezing tight, tighter with the belly, and you're never bulging the bellybutton forward.\"\n\nThis is our fourth week of class, and we've been doing this same exercise on our own every day for at least 10 minutes. So it's judgment day. Time to see whether we've flattened our bellies and resolved the diastasis recti.\n\nKeller pulls out a measuring tape and starts wrapping it around women's middles. She also has us lie down on the floor, so she can measure the separation in our abdominal muscles.\n\nOne by one, there is success after success. Several moms completely closed up their abdominal separations. Many lost inches from their bellies.\n\nOne woman had amazing results. \"Oh my goodness, you lost nearly four inches from your belly circumference,\" Keller exclaims. \"That's amazing!\"\n\nHow did I fare? Well, after three weeks, I didn't completely close up the abdominal separation. My separation decreased from 1.2 inches to 0.8 inches.* But I did drop more than an inch from my belly circumference.\n\nAnd I am quite happy with the results. My abs are definitely firmer. And regularly doing this exercise brought a bonus benefit: My lower back pain has almost completely gone away.\n\n*I continued to do the exercises after the class had finished. I checked with in Keller three weeks later to have her measure my diastasis recti. At that point, the separation had dropped down to 0.6 inches, which meant technically I no longer have diastasis recti.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story included information on where this and other exercise programs are available.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A Veterans Affairs database study of more than 83,000 patients found that men whose low testosterone was restored to normal through gels, patches, or injections had a lower risk of heart attack, stroke, or death from any cause, versus similar men who were not treated.\n\nThe study also found that men who were treated but did not attain normal levels did not see the same benefits as those whose levels did reach normal. The study was published online Aug. 6, 2015, in the European Heart Journal.\n\nThe findings may sway the ongoing debate over testosterone therapy's benefits and risks, especially for the heart. Studies over the past few years have yielded mixed results, although part of that might stem from differing patient populations and research methods.\n\nFor example, the new VA study excluded men with a history of heart attacks or strokes, although it did include those with existing heart disease. A much-cited VA database study that was published in JAMA in 2013 looked specifically at men with coronary artery disease; about 20 percent of the total study group of around 8,700 men had suffered a prior heart attack.\n\nSo far, the medical community lacks results from any definitive clinical trial that might provide clear guidance. Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration issued guidance earlier in 2015 advising clinicians about the over-use of testosterone therapy, and pointing to a possible increased risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\nThe new VA study is likely to draw attention because of its large size and relatively long follow-up period.\n\nDr. Rajat Barua, the paper's corresponding author, says the study is also noteworthy because of its finding that administering the right dose is critical: Treating \"low T\" but not restoring levels to normal doesn't appear to impart much benefit, at least in terms of cardiovascular risk. Testosterone isn't prescribed with the goal of improving heart health, but that is a consideration in many cases.\n\n\"It is the first study to demonstrate that significant benefit is observed only if the dose is adequate to normalize the total testosterone levels,\" Barua and his coauthors wrote. \"Patients who failed to achieve the therapeutic range after testosterone replacement therapy did not see a reduction in [heart attack] or stroke and had significantly less benefit on mortality.\"\n\nBarua is with the Kansas City (Mo.) VA Medical Center. He's also an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Kansas.\n\nThe study team looked at national data on more than 83,000 men with documented low testosterone, all age 50 or above, who received care in VA between 1999 and 2014.\n\nThe researchers divided the men into three clinical groups: those who were treated to the point where their total testosterone levels returned to normal (Group 1); those who were treated but without reaching normal (Group 2); and those who were untreated and remained at low levels (Group 3).\n\nImportantly, all three groups were \"propensity matched\" so the comparisons would be between men with similar health profiles. The researchers took into account a wide array of factors that might affect cardiovascular and overall risk. They included, for example, age, body mass index, various chronic diseases, LDL cholesterol levels, and the use of aspirin, beta blockers, and statins.\n\nThe average follow-up across the groups ranged from 4.6 to 6.2 years.\n\nThe sharpest contrast emerged between Group 1 (those who were treated and attained normal levels) and Group 3 (those whose low testosterone went untreated). The treated men were 56 percent less likely to die during the follow-up period, 24 percent less likely to suffer a heart attack, and 36 percent less likely to have a stroke.\n\nThe differences between Group 1 and Group 2 (those who were treated but did not attain normal levels) were similar but less pronounced.\n\nLittle difference emerged between Groups 2 and 3, except for a slight benefit in survival for those who were treated.\n\nBarua and colleagues say they don't know the exact reasons for testosterone's apparent benefits for the heart and overall survival. \"The mechanisms for these effects remain speculative,\" they write. Possible explanations, they say, could involve body fat, insulin sensitivity, lipids, blood platelets, inflammation, or other biological pathways. More research is needed, they say, to clarify how testosterone affects the cardiovascular system.\n\nWhile the new study results do seem to advocate for testosterone replacement therapy, Barua stresses the need for \"appropriate screening, selection, dosing, and follow-up of patients to maximize the benefit of testosterone therapy.\"\n\nThe authors also caution that \"off-label\" use remains a concern. In other words, doctors should not write a prescription simply because an older man is complaining of symptoms such as low energy and low sex drive. According to the FDA, \"Testosterone products are FDA-approved only for use in men who lack or have low testosterone levels in conjunction with an associated medical condition. Examples of these conditions include failure of the testicles to produce testosterone because of reasons such as genetic problems or chemotherapy. ...

And cancer patients may experience low platelet counts and be at risk for a clotting disorder called 'heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.'\" Dr. McBane noted that cancer and cancer treatment can be associated with kidney injury, which can limit the drug's use further.

However, it was unclear whether these drugs could be used safely in cancer patients until now.\n\nDr. McBane says quality of life surveys, which were taken monthly throughout the six-month trial, showed that patients markedly preferred oral apixaban over injectable dalteparin. \"We are hopeful that this medication will also improve medication compliance in cancer patients requiring blood thinner therapy.\"\n\nAs a leading institution funded by the National Cancer Institute, Mayo Clinic Cancer Center conducts basic, clinical and population science research, translating discoveries into improved methods for prevention, diagnosis, prognosis and therapy.

Therefore, quitting leads to a quick drop in endorphin levels, he said.\n\n\u201cThe laser basically stimulates the nerve endings to tell the brain to release a flood of endorphins\u201d to boost a patient over that initial 3-5 day hump of withdrawal symptoms, he said.\n\nThe treatment also targets other points that are thought to suppress appetite \u2014 to prevent the weight gain that often comes with quitting smoking \u2014 and promote relaxation, according to Innovative Laser Therapy.\n\nBut does it work?\n\nThere's limited research showing that laser therapy might help some smokers quit. Innovative Laser Therapy cites one study, a 2008 paper published in the Journal of Chinese Medicine, available on their site at link.reuters.com/pus95p. A UK-based team found that smokers that had four laser treatments over two weeks were more likely to quit than smokers that had three treatments. Those in the three treatment group, in turn, had better success rates than a control group that was given fake laser treatments.\n\nAfter 6 months, 55 percent of the four-treatment group was smoke-free, compared to 19 percent of the three-treatment group and 6 percent of those who were treated with fake lasers.\n\nThe authors weren\u2019t able to follow most of the 340 participants for more than 6 months after treatment, so they don\u2019t know if those who stopped smoking started up again, or if they really quit for good. And the journal\u2019s site - which offers lasers and other treatments for sale \u2014 does not say whether it is peer-reviewed.\n\nIn contrast, a 2000 Singapore study of 330 adolescents found no difference in 3-month quitting rates for participants treated with real or fake laser therapy.\n\n\u201cIn scientific terms, this one (UK) study is not enough evidence to recommend (the) laser for smoking cessation,\u201d Dr. Adrian White told Reuters Health by email. Dr. White is a research fellow at Peninsula Medical School in the UK who co-authored a review of laser therapy and similar smoking cessation methods for the Cochrane Collaboration, an international organization that evaluates medical research. \u201cThe results conflict with the other study, and they seem \u2018too good to be true.\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 1 in 5 Americans is a current cigarette smoker, and the majority of them smoke every day. The American Heart Association reports that more than 80 percent of smokers say they want to quit. But many smokers try more than one smoking cessation method or take years of trying before they do quit for good.\n\nPinto launched Innovative Laser Therapy after he successfully quit smoking with a round of laser therapy from a clinic in Florida. His company charges $350 for a one-time treatment that takes less than an hour, and offers free extra treatments to patients who are still struggling with quitting in the following 6 months. Other companies do a few shorter therapy sessions as part of their regular treatment plan.\n\nUsing acupuncture methods to treat addictions such as smoking is not new, White said, but there is still no clear evidence that treatment with needles has any therapeutic effects either.\n\nAnd while the laser device used by clinics including Innovative Laser Therapy has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for temporary pain relief, the agency has not cleared it to be marketed for smoking cessation.\n\nThe UK study found that the side effects of the treatment were similar to some withdrawal symptoms, and the FDA has classified the laser as a \u201cnonsignificant risk\u201d device. Pinto says that the biggest side effect he sees is that \u201cpeople feel relaxed during the treatment.\u201d\n\nNeil Camera, the president of Laser Therapeutics, Inc., says that FDA approval could be on the horizon. His company, which produces the lasers and supplies them to centers that are running clinical trials on the treatment\u2019s effectiveness, has had an application for approval in to the FDA for three and half years, he said.\n\nBut the government organization had only dealt with drugs - not new technology - for smoking cessation, which has slowed down the process, Camera said. \u201cThe FDA didn\u2019t know how to handle it, quite frankly,\u201d he told Reuters Health. \u201cThat was the biggest drawback.\u201d\n\nDr. Neil Spielholz, of Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, was involved with the initial study submitted to the FDA - the same one that showed the success of laser treatment in UK smokers. The FDA had a couple of problems with that study, he said, including that successful quitting was measured by a smoker\u2019s own reports, and not by more modern methods that calculate the amount of carbon monoxide in someone\u2019s breath. In response, Laser Therapeutics is designing another study to address those comments, he said.\n\nA spokesperson from the FDA confirmed that the agency is aware of the concept of using low level lasers for smoking cessation and had been in discussions with those seeking to get it approved on how they should proceed.\n\nUsually three convincing studies involving large groups of human patients are needed before the FDA decides to approve a treatment.\n\nPinto says that Innovative Laser Therapy follows up on the success of all of its clients a month after the treatment for clinical evidence that will be part of the package of data presented to the FDA.\n\n\u201cThe company (Laser Therapeutics) is going crazy,\u201d Spielholz told Reuters Health. \u201cThey want to get this thing approved, obviously.\u201d\n\nBut, he said of the initial evidence in favor of the treatment, \u201cthis one is only a single study, which of course the people who believe in lasers will jump on ... (but) things have got to be confirmed. One study, no matter how many patients are in it, really needs one or two confirmation studies.\u201d\n\nIf future studies do show its effectiveness, laser treatment would have a leg up over conventional methods of smoking cessation, such as medications including Chantix and Zyban, said Spielholz, who continues to work with Laser Therapeutics on getting FDA approval.\n\nThe lack of any drugs involved in laser therapy \u201cwould be the beauty of this,\u201d he said. \u201cYou do not have those side effects of suicidal thoughts and feelings of paranoia that are reported for the drugs,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Laser Therapeutics\u2019 Camera said, the treatment won\u2019t work on everybody. \u201cThe person has to be wanting to quit smoking,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can\u2019t be dragged in by a spouse or whatever, because nothing\u2019s going to work then.\u201d\n\nDr. Martha Daviglus, who studies preventative medicine at Northwestern University, agreed that the most important part of any smoking cessation program was that smokers were ready to quit. After seeing the initial research, she\u2019s hopeful, but cautious, about low-level laser therapy as a way to help people do that.\n\n\u201cThere are hundreds of methods to quit smoking,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can hope that this is going to be a method that is going to help people.\u201d But, Daviglus said, \u201cWe need more research and more evidence.\u201d", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story explains how these laser treatments are part of an emerging trend that grew out of acupuncture.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "LONDON, ON - Scientists from Children's Health Research Institute, a program of Lawson Health Research Institute, and Western University have developed a new blood test that identifies with greater than 90 per cent certainty whether or not an adolescent athlete has suffered a concussion.\n\nDiagnosis of a clinically significant concussion, or a mild traumatic brain injury, can be difficult as it currently relies on a combination of patient symptom assessment and clinician judgement. Equally problematic are the decisions to stop play or activities, or when patients who have suffered a concussion can safely return to normal activities without risking further injury.\n\nIn the new study, researchers have demonstrated that a blood test can now accurately diagnose a concussion using a form of blood profiling known as metabolomics. Dr. Douglas Fraser, a physician in the Paediatric Critical Care Unit at Children's Hospital, London Health Sciences Centre and Lawson scientist, led the study with his co-investigator Mark Daley, a professor in the Departments of Computer Science, Biology and Statistics & Actuarial Sciences at Western University.\n\nIn the relatively inexpensive test, blood is drawn from an individual that may have suffered a concussion as the result of a sudden blow to the head (or from transmitted forces from a sudden blow to the body) within 72 hours of the incident. The scientists measure a panel of metabolites - small molecules that are the products of the body's metabolism - in the blood to search for distinct patterns that indicate a concussion has occurred.\n\n\"This novel approach, to use blood testing of metabolites as a diagnostic tool for concussions, was exploratory and we were extremely pleased with the robustness of our initial results,\" says Dr. Fraser, also an Associate Professor in Western's Departments of Paediatrics, Physiology & Pharmacology and Clinical Neurological Sciences at the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry. \"We looked at a host of patterns and it appears that those who suffered a concussion have a very different pattern than those who have not had a concussion.\"\n\nThis new method, fully funded by the Children's Health Foundation and conducted by the Western Concussion Study Group, is unique in that previous attempts have looked unsuccessfully for a single highly accurate protein biomarker that can distinguish concussed from non-concussed adolescent patients.\n\nIn this latest successful attempt, the researchers took a different approach and investigated a full spectrum of 174 metabolites.\n\n\"We looked at all of these metabolites in concussed male adolescent patients and in non-concussed male adolescent patients and it turns out that the spectrum is really different,\" explains Daley, who is also Western's Associate Vice-President (Research) and a principal investigator at Western's renowned Brain & Mind Institute. \"There is no one metabolite that we can put a finger on but when we looked at all of them, those profiles are different enough that we could easily distinguish concussed patients from non-concussed. In fact, with fine tuning we can now look at sets of as few as 20-40 specific metabolites and maintain the diagnostic accuracy level of the test over 90 per cent.\"\n\nConcussion is a major public health concern, often resulting in significant acute symptoms and in some individuals, long-term neurological dysfunction.\n\n\"The discovery of a blood test that can aid in concussion diagnosis is very important,\" says Dr. Fraser. \"With further research, we anticipate that our blood test will also aid clinicians in predicting concussion outcome, as well as aid rehabilitation after concussion.\"\n\nThe findings were recently published in the international journal Metabolomics.\n\nThe technology is subject to a patent application filed through WORLDiscoveries\u00ae, the joint technology transfer office of Lawson and Western.\n\n\"This relatively quick and inexpensive blood test for concussion is by far the most accurate reported with tremendous potential for clinical management and commercialization,\" says Kirk Brown, Manager of Business Development for Lawson.\n\nWestern delivers an academic experience second to none.

Kelly Nichols, O.D., Ph.D., a dry eye expert and dean of the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Optometry, conducted research studies for the parent drug company to explore the efficacy and safety of lifitegrast in treating this eye condition that affects more than 16 million adults in the United States.\n\nInflammation associated with dry eye may eventually lead to damage to the surface of the eye.\n\n\u201cDry eye is a common complaint to eye care professionals, with millions of U.S. adults experiencing the symptoms of this often chronic disease,\u201d Nichols said. \u201cIt is critical for eye care professionals to have a dialogue with patients who report symptoms because dry eye can be a progressive ocular surface disease.\u201d\n\nThe twice-daily eye drop solution of 5 percent lifitegrast ophthalmic solution is the only prescription eye drop indicated for the treatment of both signs and symptoms of dry eye, and it is the first new dry eye prescription drop approved in the last 13 years.\n\nNichols and a team of researchers studied 1,181 patients, of whom 1,067 received lifitegrast in four placebo-controlled 12-week trials. Signs and symptoms were assessed at baseline and at weeks two, six and 12.\n\nIn all four studies, eye dryness was significantly reduced, with two of the studies showing improvements at week two. Results from inferior corneal staining tests \u2014 used by physicians to detect abrasions on the cornea \u2014 showed improvement in three of the four studies.\n\nNichols continues to push for funding and advancement for dry eye research and treatment. Prior to FDA approval of the lifitegrast eye drop, Nichols presented a congressional briefing in Washington, D.C., addressing research into dry eye for the National Alliance for Eye and Vision Research. She focused on the cause and potential therapies for dry eye that are being funded through the National Eye Institute and in private industry.\n\nFocusing her research on all aspects of the eye, Nichols discussed the mechanics of the three layers of the tear film and the importance of each from the cornea outward:\n\u2022 Mucin layer: helps tears adhere to the eye\n\u2022 Aqueous layer or water layer: nourishes and protects the cornea\n\u2022 Lipid or oil layer: lubricates and prevents evaporation and provides smooth refractive surface needed for optimal vision\n\n\u201cWe are unsure which of the 200-plus different lipids and 500-plus unique proteins are most important for protecting and lubricating the eye, and the absence or insufficiency of which results in dry eye,\u201d Nichols said.\n\nThere are more than 30-plus new dry eye basic, translational and clinical studies being funded by the NEI/National Institutes of Health to further explore these lipids and proteins, with more than 50 papers being published monthly.\n\n\u201cFunding from NIH is helping the optometry world make significant strides in understanding the cause and treatment of dry eye,\u201d Nichols said. \u201cWe still have a long way to go, but prevention and early detection are major goals. There is hope for dry eye patients worldwide.\u201d\n\nDiagnosis of dry eye is identified by an eye care professional based on careful evaluation of signs and symptoms, including dryness, discomfort, vision changes and damage to the surface of the eye.

The outcome was excellent, but the recovery was long and horrible. The orthopedist wouldn\u2019t let me drive for six weeks, or run, swim or lift weights for three months. I suffered through weeks of torturous physical therapy. It was nearly six months before I felt normal again.\n\nSo in 2014, after a nurse improperly administered a vaccination that resulted in chronic pain and an MRI revealed another rotator-cuff tear, I vowed I would not go through shoulder surgery (or its aftermath) again.\n\nCortisone injections and physical therapy didn\u2019t help, so I decided to try something else: platelet-rich plasma, a therapy that uses the body\u2019s natural healing properties to mend injuries. Its practitioners believe it will transform orthopedics. Based on my experience with it, I think they are right.\n\nIt may not work for every condition, or for everyone. But it worked for me.\n\n[PRP therapy is popular for sports injuries, but does it work?]\n\nBefore undergoing PRP treatment, I read quite a bit about it, learning that it holds promise for healing soft-tissue injuries such as tearing of the rotator cuff (the group of tendons and muscles that provide stability to the shoulder), tennis elbow, plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendinitis, patella tendinitis and hamstring tears; it may even provide relief for mild to moderate osteoarthritis.\n\n\u201c[PRP] works, and the results have been amazing,\u2019\u2019 says John Ferrell, the sports medicine physician who treated me. \u201cThere still needs to be more research done to perfect the process, but [it] will change the way orthopedics is practiced in the future. We will be more preventive. We will be able to treat ailments noninvasively, and at an earlier stage.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe procedure involves collecting several ounces of blood from a patient\u2019s arm, spinning the blood in a centrifuge to concentrate the platelets and injecting the concentrated platelets into the injury site to stimulate healing. Platelets, the blood cells that promote clotting, contain hundreds of proteins, called growth factors, that are important in repairing injuries.\n\n\u201cPRP works by acting like a stem-cell magnet,\u2019\u2019 says Ferrell, who practices at Regenerative Orthopedics & Sports Medicine, which has several offices in the Washington area. \u201cIt releases growth factors that signal stem cells to come [and] help regenerate the injured area. Rotator-cuff tendon partial tears are notorious for not healing because of the poor blood supply there. PRP actually creates new blood vessels that feed the tendon the proper nutrients it needs to heal.\u2019\u2019\n\nA recent pilot study conducted at the Glen Sather Sports Medicine Clinic at the University of Alberta on rotator-cuff tears supports this. It showed tissue healing in five of seven of the patients who received PRP, as well as improvements in their pain and function.\n\nThe researchers call the results \u201cclinically relevant,\u2019\u2019 despite the study\u2019s small size, and say the next step should be a larger, controlled clinical trial. \u201cI\u2019ve heard some skeptics call PRP a cure looking for a disease, but it is being used in so many areas of medicine now with promising outcomes,\u201d says Marni Wesner, a sports medicine physician at the clinic and one of the study\u2019s authors. \u201cThe potential for benefit from PRP is real.\u2019\u2019\n\nI had my first appointment with Ferrell last October to find out whether PRP might help me. By then, my painful shoulder had been keeping me up nights for more than a year. It bothered me while swimming and lifting weights, and while getting dressed. By performing several tests to assess my strength and range of motion, Ferrell discovered that my left shoulder \u2014 the site of the tear \u2014 was considerably weaker than my right.\n\nHe then used ultrasound to find the tear and showed it to me on a monitor. It turned out to be larger than indicated in the static MRI pictures I had obtained earlier.\n\nBefore deciding whether PRP was right for me, he had to be sure that the tear was the source of my pain and weakness. He injected an anesthetic into the tear, then he ran the strength tests again. My strength was significantly better. This meant that the tear was causing my problems, and fixing it probably would restore strength and function to my shoulder and end my pain.\n\nI had the first PRP injection on Oct. 23. It was painful, and the aching persisted for about 36 hours. I had one bad night, followed by an uncomfortable day. After that, the pain stopped. Still, Ferrell advised me to baby the shoulder \u2014 to use my other arm when holding a dog leash and to skip swimming and weights for two weeks. Running was fine. He also recommended physical therapy after two weeks.\n\nAfter what I went through in 2008, those were restrictions I could live with.\n\nFerrell told me not to use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, such as ibuprofen, for a week after the injection because the goal is to encourage, not stifle, inflammation. Other pain relievers such as acetaminophen were okay. \u201cWe want to stimulate an acute inflammatory reaction, which will trigger the healing cascade to start to work,\u2019\u2019 Ferrell says.\n\nBecause there is not yet enough research on PRP \u2014 and because some studies have shown mixed results \u2014 insurance will not cover it.\n\nStill, \u201cit has significant cost savings\u201d compared with surgery, Ferrell says. The average treatment is two injections, which costs about $1,000 at his practice, whereas rotator-cuff surgery runs about $13,000, he says, although insurance often covers most of the costs of surgery.\n\nWith additional research, insurance may ultimately pay for PRP. Unfortunately, there is little financial incentive to conduct such studies because there is nothing for the Food and Drug Administration to approve, such as a drug or device. The centrifuges already are licensed, and the procedure uses a patient\u2019s own blood, which is regarded as safe. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons \u2014 which says PRP \u201cholds great promise\u2019\u2019 \u2014 describes the risk as minimal.\n\nThose who seek this treatment must look for a clinician with considerable PRP experience \u2014 someone who does the procedure several times a day, not once or twice a month \u2014 and who has a good success rate, Ferrell says.\n\nMoreover, \u201cyou see the greatest results when the injections are done under direct visualization with ultrasound,\u201d he adds.\n\nBy February, the ultrasound showed my tear to be about 80 percent healed. The remaining tear was quite small. Ferrell recommended a second injection to finish the job.\n\nI had it on March 4.\n\nWhen I returned to see him on April 12, I was feeling pretty good. No pain, no problems. He rolled in the ultrasound machine, and I was not surprised by the results.

Of the 2,021 patients, 285, or 14 percent, had additional cancer detected on MRI that was hidden from view on mammography.\n\nIn 73 of those 285 patients, or 25.6 percent, MRI identified at least one additional cancer in a different quadrant of the breast than the index cancer, or the cancer detected by mammography and/or breast palpation.\n\nThese multicentric cancers were larger than the known index cancer in 17 of the 73 patients, or 23.3 percent. In addition, the MRI-detected multicentric cancers were greater than 1 centimeter in size in 25 percent of the 73 patients.\n\n\"We believe invasive cancer larger than 1 centimeter is clinically relevant disease,\" Dr. Iacconi said. \"In general, it is accepted that radiation can likely treat invasive cancer less than 1 centimeter, but lesions larger than 1 centimeter, especially invasive carcinomas, may not be reliably treated with conservation.\"\n\nThe additional MRI-detected multicentric cancers were found mostly in patients with heterogeneously dense or extremely dense breasts. However, MRI also detected additional disease in 19 percent of patients with fatty or scattered fibroglandular tissue.\n\n\"The results show that multicentric cancer detected on breast MRI after mammography appears to represent a larger tumor burden in approximately a quarter of patients and can result in potential changes to cancer grade and treatment,\" Dr. Iacconi said.\n\n\"Multicentric Cancer Detected at Breast MR Imaging and Not at Mammography: Important or Not?\" Collaborating with Dr. Iacconi on this paper were Lanie Galman, M.D., Juntig Zheng, M.S., Virgilio Sacchini, M.D., Elizabeth J.

But the jury's still out as to how worthwhile the extra technology is overall.\n\nFor one thing, computer-aided detection (CAD) increases the amount of diagnostic testing among women who turn out not to have breast cancer. And the technology makes mammograms more expensive.\n\nCAD is becoming more widespread, said Dr. Joshua Fenton, an associate professor of family and community medicine at the University of California, Davis, and lead study author. \"It's an add-on and now is used in probably three-quarters of U.S. mammograms,\" he said.\n\nComputer-aided detection systems use a digitized mammogram image from either a traditional film mammogram or a digitally acquired mammogram, according to the American College of Radiology. The CAD software looks for areas that may indicate cancer so the radiologist can then look more closely at the mammogram.\n\nAlthough it has rapidly become part of mammogram screening, Fenton said there is limited and conflicting research on its effect.\n\nUnder Medicare payment rates, doctors get an additional $11 for adding computer-aided detection to a mammogram, said Fenton, citing Medicare data. The Medicare rate for a film mammogram is $81 while a digital mammogram is $139.\n\nHis team evaluated more than 409,000 mammograms -- with and without computer-aided detection -- from more than 163,000 women aged 67 to 89. The study is published in the April 16 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nFenton took data from a large U.S. epidemiology database from 2001 to 2006. During that time, computer-aided detection use increased from 3.6 percent to 60.5 percent. Now, with about 75 percent of mammograms adding it, it is even more common, Fenton said.\n\n\"In our study, we assessed its impact in the Medicare program,\" he said. The researchers compared the results when mammograms included CAD to when they did not.\n\nWhen computer-aided detection was used, doctors found a greater number of early cancers known as ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS. \"But the [overall] rate of invasive breast cancer diagnosis was no different with or without CAD,\" Fenton said.\n\nHowever, among the women who did have invasive cancer, computer-aided detection was linked with a greater likelihood of finding the cancer while it was stage 1 or 2 compared to stage 3 or 4, they found.\n\n\"CAD was also associated with increased diagnostic testing among women who turned out not to have breast cancer,\" he said. These women, because breast cancer was suspected, had to be called back for additional tests, such as repeat mammograms or biopsies.\n\nSo is the new computer technology worth it? \"Our study doesn't answer that question; it raises that question,\" Fenton said. The findings, he said, are a mix of potential good news and not so good. The additional tests that turn out to be unnecessary, because no cancer is found, are not desirable, he said.\n\nSome of the very early cancers diagnosed in older women, he noted, may not have caused them a problem during their lifetime. But doctors can't say with certainty which ones will progress and which ones will not.\n\n\"Women should recognize that CAD comes with some potential risks,\" Fenton said. \"It has the potential risk of a false-positive mammogram. If you are an older woman, [there is] the risk of overtreatment of noninvasive lesions.\"\n\nDr. Daniel Kopans, a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School and senior radiologist in the breast imaging division at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the study provides additional information to doctors and women, but has some limitations. He was not involved with the study.\n\n\"The good news is the use of CAD was related to finding invasive cancers at smaller sizes and earlier stages than before the CAD era,\" said Kopans, also a member of the American College of Radiology's Breast Imaging Commission. \"There should be no argument that finding invasive cancers at a smaller size and earlier stage is beneficial,\" he said, as they are more likely to be cured.\n\nWhile he calls finding more DCIS with computer-aided detection also ''likely a good thing,\" he acknowledged the debate about the possibility that a very early cancer in an elderly woman may not cause a problem in her lifetime. Although the treatment of DCIS is debated among experts, Kopans said, \"In my mind, it is always worth it to find additional cancers.\"\n\nOne limitation of the study, he said, is that the researchers cannot say for sure it was the computer-aided detection that made the difference. Other factors could have played a role, such as the radiologists becoming more experienced, he said.\n\nTo learn more about mammography, visit the American College of Radiology/Radiological Society of North America.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Early in the article, the study author is quoted observing that \u201cIt\u2019s an add-on and now is used in probably three-quarters of U.S. mammograms.\u201d\nWomen would have to ask if CAD is being used to read their mammograms.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "January 6, 2015 / It is normal for cognitive function to slightly deteriorate with age. Memory capacity begins to worsen, along with processing speed and the ability to form long-term memories. Finding a way to defer the onset of these issues becomes increasingly important as life expectancy gets longer and global populations age.\n\nThis study, conducted by researchers from Italy's University of L'Aquila and Mars, Incorporated, reinforces the results of several recent cognitive studies--throwing more light on the important role diet plays in maintaining cognitive health. Dr. Giovambattista Desideri, lead author on the paper, said, \"The results of this study are encouraging--they support the idea that diet, and specifically a diet rich in cocoa flavanols, can play an important role in maintaining cognitive health as we age.\"\n\nThis study was the second installment in a two-part investigation by this team into the effects cocoa flavanols have on the brain. The first study, published in the journal Hypertension in 2012, found cognitive and cardiometabolic benefits of habitual cocoa flavanol consumption in older adults who had been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Despite these findings, the question of the benefits of cocoa flavanols on cognitive function among individuals without MCI remained uncertain.\n\nThis second study just published in the AJCN looked to address this question. Enrolling men and women aged 61-85 years with no evidence of cognitive dysfunction, the participants in this controlled, randomized, double-blind study were assigned to one of three flavanol groups, consuming a drink containing either high (993 mg), intermediate (520 mg) or low (48 mg) amounts of cocoa flavanols every day for eight weeks. The nutritionally matched drinks were specially prepared. The high- and intermediate-flavanol cocoa drinks were produced using Mars' patented Cocoapro\u00ae process, while the low-flavanol drink was made with a highly processed, alkalized cocoa powder. Other than the inclusion of the test drink, normal diets and regular lifestyle were maintained throughout the study.\n\nAt the start of the study and again after eight weeks, cognitive function was assessed using a battery of tests that examined memory, retention, recall, as well as executive function. Among those individuals who regularly consumed either the high- or intermediate-flavanol drinks, there were significant improvements in overall cognitive function after only eight weeks. As cognitive function was normal for this aged population, this study shows that even cognitively healthy individuals can quickly benefit from the regular inclusion of cocoa flavanols in their diets.\n\nIn addition to evaluating cognitive function, the researchers also monitored insulin resistance, blood pressure and other metabolic markers. Excitingly, there was also evidence of improvements in these cardiometabolic outcomes. In the high- and intermediate-flavanol groups, both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced and insulin resistance was significantly improved. In contrast, only a modest improvement in diastolic blood pressure was observed in the low-flavanol group, with no significant improvements in either systolic blood pressure or insulin resistance among the consumers of the low-flavanol drink.\n\nIt is not yet fully understood how cocoa flavanols bring about improvements in cognitive function, but the study's authors suggest that the improvements in insulin resistance and blood pressure could be revealing. \"Earlier studies suggest a central role for insulin resistance in brain aging,\" said Desideri. \"These results could therefore provide some insight into a possible mechanism of action for the cognitive improvements we have observed.\"\n\nOver the past decade, there has been significant evidence indicating that consuming cocoa flavanols improves vascular function. Dr. Catherine Kwik-Uribe, human health and nutrition director at Mars, Incorporated, and co-author on this latest study, said, \"Since the brain is a heavily vascularized tissue, we might also be looking at vascular improvements as underlying the observed improvements in cognitive function.\"\n\nDr. Kwik-Uribe went on to speak about Mars' flavanol research program that has spanned over two decades: \"The amount of research showing the beneficial effects of cocoa flavanol consumption is growing and Mars is proud to be a partner in important research like this that highlights the positive role cocoa flavanols may play in supporting healthy aging.\"\n\nDr. Desideri and his team are already thinking about the next steps: \"It is clear from our latest research and other recent studies that cocoa flavanols have profound effects on the body, and specifically the brain,\" said Desideri. \"Now we'd like to know how they work and how long the effects last. If these further studies confirm the findings that brain health can be improved by consuming dietary flavanols, it may have the potential to affect the daily lives of millions of people world-wide.\"\n\nNote to Editors: This research trial was carried out with a special cocoa flavanol test product, designed to deliver a standardized amount of flavanols within a nutritionally suitable drink. This test product is currently not commercially available. Flavanol content of commercially available chocolate is variable and, given its macronutrient profile, it is not recommended as a health food.\n\nFlavanols are a distinct group of naturally occurring compounds that can be found in a variety of foods such as tea and red wine. Cocoa flavanols refers to the group of bioactives found naturally in fresh cocoa beans. Cocoa is an especially rich source of flavanols and the type and mixture of flavanols and procyanidins found in cocoa is unique. Mars studies show cocoa flavanols have a range of proven health benefits, including improved circulation and cardiovascular health.

This has long been used as a folk remedy for skin lesions.\n\nThe new findings are published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nActinic keratoses are typically red, scaly skin lesions that can over time develop into a type of skin cancer. They can often be found on sun-exposed areas of the body such as the face, scalp, arms, and legs.\n\nThe new gel, Picato (ingenol mebutate), is applied once daily for two or three days, depending on the area being treated. Other available topical treatments must be used for several weeks, and often irritate the skin. Cryotherapy, or freezing the affected skin area, is also used but can sometimes leave a scar.\n\nBecause the new gel is only used for a few days, any irritation is usually short-lived.

With better drugs and radiation techniques available, the proportion of women with Stage 4 breast cancer who had surgery dropped from 67.8 percent in 1988 to 25.1 percent in 2011, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Surgery.\n\nBut the study raises an intriguing question about that approach. It shows that women who had surgery survived longer than those who didn't: a median of 28 months vs. 19 months. When the researchers examined a small subset of the group \u2014 those who survived 10 years \u2014 they found that 9.6 percent had chosen to have surgery while 2.9 percent had not.\n\n\"Maybe we need to revisit this question of surgery,\" said Mary C. Schroeder, an assistant professor in the College of Pharmacy at the University of Iowa and one of the authors of the study. \"It may not be right for all women, but it may be better for some women than it was in 1995.\"\n\n[He had a 3.5-pound tumor and months to live. Here's how he survived]\n\nPrevious research has reached the same conclusion, but a significant problem with this study and others like it is that they rely on retrospective data, looking back over any number of years, said Michael S. Sabel, the chief of surgical oncology at the University of Michigan, who was not involved in the newly published study. In retrospective research, it's impossible to filter out the countless reasons that a woman and her doctor might have made the decision to treat the cancer with or without surgery, leaving the conclusions unreliable for clinical decision-making, he said.\n\n\"It's premature to suggest, and it\u2019s a difficult conversation to have with patients, that removing the breast will help them live longer in the face of Stage 4 disease,\" Sabel said.\n\nTwo small prospective studies have suggested no survival difference among women with Stage 4 breast cancer who have surgery and those who don't, he said. A large, randomized, prospective study currently being conducted by the Eastern Clinical Oncology Group should produce the most reliable data on the subject to date, he said.\n\nIn a Stage 4 case, cancer cells have left the breast, metastizing to bones or other organs, which presents a more dire and immediate threat to a woman's survival than the presence of the original tumor. Still there may be reasons to remove the cancer in the breast. Some evidence suggests that it may be influencing the woman's immunological response to her cancer. Or it could be continuously \"seeding\" the spread of cancer to other parts of the body.\n\nIn their study, Schroeder; Alexandra Thomas, a professor at Iowa's Carver College of Medicine, and others looked at 21,372 women from 1988 to 2011 who had Stage 4 breast cancer at the time of their original diagnosis and did not receive radiation as part of their first course of therapy. Their median age was 63.\n\n[Cancer trials are changing. That could mean faster access to better drugs]\n\nThe researchers found that median survival for all of the women improved from 20 to 26 months as more sophisticated treatments and better imaging techniques developed over that time. As other research has shown, African American women were over-represented among women who have Stage 4 breast cancer at the time they are first diagnosed.\n\nIn interviews, Schroeder and Thomas stressed that each decision about whether to have surgery is based on many factors that only a woman and her doctors can assess, in particular how far the cancer has spread and how sick she is.\n\nBut with better therapies to control the cancer systemically and improved imaging that finds ever-smaller deposits of cancer in other parts of the body, it may be time to see whether surgery also can help increase the length of survival times, they said.\n\n\"Aggressive local therapy may benefit select women, such as those with an already established potential for durable remission,\" they wrote in their paper. That would include younger women whose cancers have not spread in great volume to other organs and who have certain kinds of cancers that respond better to drugs, Lisa Newman, medical director of the Henry Ford Health System's International Center for the Study of Breast Cancer Subtypes, said in an e-mail. Newman was not involved in the study.\n\n\"Theoretically...patients with metastatic breast cancer might benefit from surgery to remove the cancerous breast tumor in combination with medical therapies as a more complete reduction of their total body cancer burden,\" she added.\n\nWith $45 billion pledge to charity, Mark Zuckerberg and wife imagine \u2018a world without suffering from disease\u2019\n\nThe myth of sugar-free drinks, candy: Study shows they can wreak havoc on teeth, too\n\nModern men tend to overeat like cavemen as a way of showing off to women\n\nFor more health news, you can sign up for our weekly newsletter here.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The availability of risk-reducing\u00a0 breast surgery is not in question, since it is not a new intervention.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "For biochemist Peter Molan, honey's ancient power to heal is not a matter of faith. So sure is he of the science behind it that he frequently applies the stuff of his research on himself -- and on his wife.\n\n\"She had a persistent boil on her buttocks,\" he explained. Since no standard salves had helped, he liquefied a dollop of a particular variety of honey known as manuka in the kitchen microwave, poured it over gauze and applied it.\n\n\"Fortunately, manuka is effective in treating burns as well as boils,\" Molan said cheerfully. Within a short time, he said, both boil and burn healed.\n\nManuka honey -- widely used for wound treatment in New Zealand, where Molan is co-director of Waikato University's Honey Research Unit -- is becoming increasingly accepted for this purpose around the world. Research over the past two decades, much of it conducted in Molan's lab, has focused on the potential for manuka to be used as an antimicrobial that may one day stand alongside such standard wound treatments as silver dressings and penicillin.\n\nManuka has also attracted attention because, in an era when the efficacy of pharmaceutical antibiotics is under threat, it has shown some promise in the treatment of wounds infected with especially challenging bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the superbug whose incidence increased 32-fold in U.S. hospitals between 1976 and 2003, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nManuka dressings have been in use for some time in Great Britain and Australia as well as in New Zealand; earlier this year they were cleared for use as an antimicrobial dressing in Canada; and last month the Food and Drug Administration cleared them for use in wound and burn care -- though not as an antimicrobial drug -- making them the first honey-based products cleared for medical use in the United States.\n\nThe picture has not always been so bright for manuka, or its manufacturers. New Zealand's scrubby manuka trees with their creamy blossoms used to be chopped down for farmland. Beekeepers regarded manuka honey as almost worthless, feeding it to their bees or simply discarding it: It was difficult to process, its taste too strong and bitter, its color too dark. In short, it seemed \"medicinal.\"\n\nThis began to change with Molan's work. He had spent his career examining the possible antibacterial properties of various natural substances: milk, yeast, bull semen. At a colleague's suggestion, he began looking into manuka honey, and for the past 25 years he has led the way in this particular aspect of apitherapy, the study of honey as a medicine.\n\nSurrounded by the pipettes and petri dishes of his lab, and with a strip of manuka dressing wrapped around a cut finger, Molan says, \"Manuka honey tastes like medicine because it is medicine.\"\n\nToday, New Zealand's Active Manuka Honey Association estimates that 120 tons are sold each year, with sales of almost $10 million annually. Manuka is proving to be a moneymaker for many companies that market it online as \"nature's miracle\" and \"nature's greatest secret,\" claiming it can relieve everything from stomach ulcers to bedsores and sinus infections. Although Molan says he has no direct financial interests in honey, the honey research unit was set up with support from New Zealand's Honey Industry Trust, and his work has resulted in his university's signing a multimillion-dollar contract last year with New Zealand health-care products company Comvita.\n\nAll honey is medicinal to some extent. Its low water content allows it to draw fluid away from wounds; its high sugar content makes it difficult for microorganisms to grow. What's more, worker bees secrete an enzyme, glucose oxidase, into nectar, which releases low levels of the disinfectant hydrogen peroxide when honey makes contact with a damp surface such as a wound. Because of a chemical reaction with tissue, honey also makes healing wounds smell good.\n\nFrom the time of the ancient Sumerians, who prescribed a mix of river dust and honey for ailing eyes, until the early 20th century, honey was a conventional therapy in fighting infection, but its popularity waned with the advent in the mid-20th century of a potent, naturally occurring antibiotic: the blue-green mold penicillin.\n\nNot all honeys are equal, though. Manuka appears to have a poorly understood antimicrobial ingredient, dubbed its Unique Manuka Factor (UMF). The level of UMF can vary, and each batch of manuka is ranked according to its UMF value: The higher the concentration, the darker, thicker and more expensive the manuka is. A 250-gram jar with UMF16, which is in the midrange, sells for about $28.95 on the Internet.\n\nAs with other natural health-care products, many of the claims for manuka's efficacy are sweeping and scantily supported. Molan distances himself from the notion, for example, that, once ingested, manuka acts as a rejuvenator. The most promising research, he and many other scientists say, focuses instead on bioactive honey's potency as a topical application.\n\nThe South African Medical Journal reported in 2006 on a trial among gold miners in which honey worked as well as, and was more cost-effective than, a standard gel on shallow wounds and abrasions.\n\nThe European Journal of Medical Research reported in 2003 that honey had an 85 percent success rate in treating infected post-op Caesarean wounds, compared with a 50 percent success rate for conventional interventions.\n\nOne reason for the heightened interest in honey is that traditional antibiotics are proving increasingly powerless against certain microbes. In 2000, a World Health Organization report warned: \"Since 1970, no new classes of antibacterials have been developed to combat infectious diseases.\" On average, the report said, \"research and development of anti-infective drugs takes 10 to 20 years.\" Today, according to the CDC, \"nearly all significant bacterial infections in the world are becoming resistant to the most commonly prescribed antibiotic treatments.\"\n\nHence the hope that a naturally occurring substance such as honey might help fill the void.\n\nMolan offers anecdotal evidence from a ward at Waikato Hospital, where MRSA has been a persistent problem. The charge nurse, he says, began placing manuka on all wounds. \"Not only did manuka clear up the infections, there were no cross-infections,\" Molan says. \"Now, whenever MRSA appears at Waikato Hospital, they choose honey dressings.\"\n\nAt the May meeting of the European Wound Management Association, researchers presented the results of a small Irish study that compared the effects of manuka honey and a commonly used hydrogel dressing on 100 patients with chronic leg ulcerations. Those patients treated with manuka dressings experienced a higher rate of cleansing and faster healing than those who used the hydrogel dressing. Ten of the patients had ulcers colonized with MRSA. After four weeks, seven of those 10 wounds no longer showed the bacteria's presence. The results have not yet been published.\n\nEven scientists who are intrigued by manuka's promise recognize that more research needs to be done. (And there's wide agreement among medical professionals that people should not test the treatment themselves by slathering their cuts and burns with honey from the pantry shelf.)\n\nAndrew Jull, a research fellow at the University of Auckland's Clinical Trials Research Unit and principal investigator in a trial in New Zealand of 368 patients into the use of honey as a therapy for leg ulcers, says that while \"there is reasonable evidence for manuka honey's antibacterial effect\" in the lab, \"there is still need for in vivo testing.\"\n\nMolan suggests there may be another reason the United States has been slower than some other countries to adopt medicinal honey: the scientific establishment's resistance to traditional remedies.\n\nHe believes it's not customers or patients who need convincing, \"it's the medical community. They find it difficult to accept anything that has an ancient lineage, whatever the scientific evidence,\" he says. \"But manuka is catching on fast.\"\n\nSo much so that in July the FDA gave Derma Sciences, a manufacturer of wound-care products based in Princeton, N.J., clearance to sell manuka wound and burn dressings as medical devices. The company, which has been developing manuka products since 2005, buys medical-grade honey from Comvita, which receives unprocessed honey from beekeepers in New Zealand. The dressings should be available this fall.\n\nRose Cooper, a microbiologist and honey expert at the University of Wales Institute at Cardiff, remains cautiously optimistic that the increased use of honey dressings will help better information to emerge.\n\n\"Honey is not a panacea,\" she said in a telephone interview, but it has been used by British doctors for several years, and with its growing use elsewhere in the world, \"health-care professionals will be more likely to consider honey in treating wounds, and so more data will accumulate.\" \u00b7\n\nEric Frederick Trump is a science journalist and a research associate of the Trauma and Violence Interdisciplinary Studies Program at New York University.

Anthocyanins are a type of flavonoid plentiful in such berries as strawberries and blueberries.\n\nFor the study, the researchers reviewed nutrition and health data from almost 50,000 men enrolled in the Health Professional Follow-Up Study and more than 80,000 women participating in the Nurses' Health Study.\n\nThe researchers looked at dietary intake of five major flavonoid sources: tea, berries, apples, orange juice and red wine.\n\nOver 20 to 22 years of follow-up, 805 people developed Parkinson's disease -- 438 men and 367 women.\n\nWhen researchers compared those who ate the most flavonoids with those who ate the least, they found that only men saw a statistically significant benefit, lowering their risk of Parkinson's by 40 percent.\n\nGao said it wasn't clear why only men benefited from the extra flavonoid intake, but he noted that other studies have also found differences between men and women. Gao said it's not clear if there's a biological mechanism causing these differences, or another factor.\n\nBut, when the researchers looked at the dietary compounds individually, it was clear that berries could benefit both men and women, lowering the risk of Parkinson's disease by about 25 percent for those who had at least two servings of berries a week.\n\nGao said that anthocyanins protect the cells from oxidative damage and they also have an anti-inflammatory effect, which may be how berries help to reduce Parkinson's risk.\n\nThe study findings should be interpreted cautiously because the participants were mostly white professionals, and the results might not apply to other ethnic groups. Also, recollections of dietary intake may be faulty, and it's possible that other properties of fruits and vegetables might have influenced the results, the authors said.\n\nDr. Michael Okun, medical director of the National Parkinson Foundation, said, \"It is exciting to see research emerging about modifiable dietary issues that may affect the risk of getting diseases such as Parkinson's.\"\n\nBut, he added, it's important for people to realize that this research isn't applicable to people who already have the disease.\n\nHe also said it will be important to confirm these findings in other studies and learn the mechanism of how berries and other flavonoids appear to offer some protection against Parkinson's disease.\n\nLearn more about Parkinson's disease from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The availability of these foods is not in question.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "\"With my technique, there is a much more limited scar and it limits the scarring in the fold of the breast, which is usually the most uncomfortable.

It is already well-established that the benefit of clot removal declines each hour during the first 6 hours after symptoms are detected.\n\nIn the current analysis of treatment between 6 and 24 hours after symptoms were observed, or after the person was last seen to be well, researchers found:\n\u2022 each 1-hour delay reduces the chance of recovery with minimal or no disability by 11 percent; and\n\u2022 treatment remains beneficial through 24 hours, with patients who had their clots removed being 35.5 percent more likely to have minimal or no disability 90 days later, but the overall effect of treatment declines with time.\n\nThe current results demonstrate the importance of prompt imaging and treatment of patients with clot-caused stroke, even in those who wake up having experienced a stroke or who for other reasons are not identified in the first few hours after the onset of symptoms.\n\u2022 Available downloadable B-roll, animation and images to this news tip are on the right column of the tip link https:/\n\u2022 For more news at AHA International Stroke Conference 2018, follow us on Twitter @HeartNews #ISC18.\n\nStatements and conclusions of study authors that are presented at American Heart Association scientific meetings are solely those of the study authors and do not necessarily reflect association policy or position.

By looking at additional beneficial side-effects of the treatments, the researchers were able to show that there was a significant antidepressant effect from the drugs compared to a placebo based on a meta-analysis of seven randomised controlled trials. Meta-analyses of the other types of clinical trials showed similar results.\n\nWhen we are exposed to an infection, for example influenza or a stomach bug, our immune system fights back to control and remove the infection. During this process, immune cells flood the blood stream with proteins known as cytokines. This process is known as systemic inflammation.\n\nEven when we are healthy, our bodies carry trace levels of these proteins - known as 'inflammatory markers' - which rise exponentially in response to infection. Previous work from the team found that children with high everyday levels of one of these markers are at greater risk of developing depression and psychosis in adulthood, suggesting a role for the immune system, particularly chronic low-grade systemic inflammation, in mental illness.\n\nInflammation can also occur as a result of the immune system mistaking healthy cells for infected cells and attacking the body, leading to autoimmune inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and Crohn's disease. New types of anti-inflammatory drugs called anti-cytokine monoclonal antibodies and cytokine inhibitors have been developed recently, some of which are now routinely used for patients who respond poorly to conventional treatments. Many more are currently undergoing clinical trials to test their efficacy and safety.\n\nThe team of researchers carried out a meta-analysis of these clinical trials and found that the drugs led to an improvement in the severity of depressive symptoms independently of improvements in physical illness. In other words, regardless of whether a drug successfully treated rheumatoid arthritis, for example, it would still help improve a patient's depressive symptoms. Their results are published today in the journal Molecular Psychiatry.\n\nDr Golam Khandaker, who led the study, says: \"It's becoming increasingly clear to us that inflammation plays a role in depression, at least for some individuals, and now our review suggests that it may be possible to treat these individuals using some anti-inflammatory drugs. These are not your everyday anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, however, but a particular new class of drugs.\"\n\n\"It's too early to say whether these anti-cytokine drugs can be used in clinical practice for depression, however,\" adds Professor Peter Jones, co-author of the study. \"We will need clinical trials to test how effective they are in patients who do not have the chronic conditions for which the drugs have been developed, such as rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease. On top of this, some existing drugs can have potentially serious side effects, which would need to be addressed.\"\n\nDr Khandaker and colleagues believe that anti-inflammatory drugs may offer hope for patients for whom current antidepressants are ineffective. Although the trials reviewed by the team involve physical illnesses that trigger inflammation - and hence potentially contribute to depression - their previous work found a connection between depression and baseline levels of inflammation in healthy people (when someone does not have an acute infection), which can be caused by a number of factors such as genes and psychological stress.\n\n\"About a third of patients who are resistant to antidepressants show evidence of inflammation,\" adds Dr Khandaker. \"So, anti-inflammatory treatments could be relevant for a large number of people who suffer from depression.\n\n\"The current approach of a 'one-size-fits-all' medicine to treat depression is problematic. All currently available antidepressants target a particular type of neurotransmitter, but a third of patients do not respond to these drugs. We are now entering the era of 'personalised medicine' where we can tailor treatments to individual patients. This approach is starting to show success in treating cancers, and it's possible that in future we would use anti-inflammatory drugs in psychiatry for certain patients with depression.\"\n\nThe research was mainly funded by the Wellcome Trust, with further support from the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.\n\nKappelmann, N et al.

There are no drugs to treat the condition, which typically sets in around the age of two, and many families have tried intensive training of their children by therapists, with mixed results. Pact instead trained the parents to help their children.\n\nProf Jonathan Green at the University of Manchester, who led the study published in the Lancet medical journal, said they had not found the cure for autism, but he and his team believed it had great potential and hoped it would be widely adopted.\n\n\u201cThe advantage of this approach over a direct therapist-child intervention is that it has potential to affect the everyday life of the child,\u201d he said. \u201cOur findings are encouraging, as they represent an improvement in the core symptoms of autism previously thought very resistant to change.\n\n\u201cThis is not a cure, in the sense that the children who demonstrated improvements will still show remaining symptoms to a variable extent, but it does suggest that working with parents to interact with their children in this way can lead to improvements in symptoms over the long term.\u201d\n\nThe trial involved 152 children aged two to four. The families visited a clinic twice a week for six months, where parents were videoed with their children and a box of toys. Autistic children might not interact with their parents at all, but when eventually a child did offer a toy or made a noise that could be interpreted as a request, the incident was rerun on video and the parent encouraged to respond. If the child offered a toy, the parent reciprocated. If the child said a word, the parent repeated it and added something. The practice was repeated at home every day.\n\nThe therapy continued with the parents for the next six months with less intensity. At the end of the first year, the researchers could see the children had improved, but the most dramatic development was seen at the follow-up six years later. At the start of the trial, 50% of those in the control group who did not get the therapy and 55% of those who did were assessed as severely autistic. The children in the intervention group, though, got better. The proportion assessed as severe in the control group was 63% by the end of six years, compared with 46% in the intervention group.\n\nOther experts applauded the work. \u201cI can see why these researchers are excited,\u201d said Dorothy Bishop, professor of developmental neuropsychology at the University of Oxford. \u201cThese results at follow-up are pretty consistent in showing the benefit of this early intervention for autism across a range of measures. My impression is that this is an intervention that reduces the severity of autistic symptoms, rather than curing autism. Nevertheless, for parents of children with autism, even a modest reduction would be worthwhile.\u201d\n\nDr Max Davie, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said it offered \u201ca hugely cheering message for families\u201d, while Uta Frith, emeritus professor of cognitive development at University College London, called it \u201ca remarkably positive story, because the intervention itself was neither intensive nor invasive\u201d.\n\nThe absence of any hope, as well as the very sudden regression in children\u2019s behaviour, led many parents to believe in the discredited theory of Andrew Wakefield that the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine was the cause of autism.\n\n\u201cParents commonly tell us that they fight for a diagnosis but when they finally get it the cupboard is bare, with little information or tailored support available to them,\u201d said Dr James Cusack, director of science at the charity Autistica. \u201cToo often, parents fall victim to the false claims of charlatans who prey on desperate families. These results look promising for the many thousands of parents who want to find early interventions for their children based on solid science.\u201d\n\nThe researchers said children\u2019s communication with their parents was improved at the end of the six years. The parents said there were also improvements in relations with other children, in social communication and in repetitive behaviours. But there was no change in child anxiety, challenging behaviours or depression in the autistic children and they would still need a lot of support while growing up.\n\nAbout 1% of children and young people are affected by autistic spectrum disorder, which ranges from mild to severe.

Using this threshold in routine practice could potentially double the number of patients suitable for immediate discharge directly from the emergency department, say the authors.\n\n\"Until now there were no quick ways to rule out a heart attack within the emergency department,\" explains lead author Dr Anoop Shah from the University of Edinburgh in the UK. \"We have identified a cardiac troponin concentration (less than 5 nanograms per deciliter; <5 ng/L) below which patients are at very low risk of heart attack either during the admission or in the ensuing 30 days. These patients are therefore potentially suitable for immediate and safe discharge from the emergency department. These findings could dramatically reduce unnecessary hospital admissions and provide substantial cost savings for healthcare providers.\"[2]\n\nOne of the most common causes of hospitalisation worldwide is acute chest pain. In the UK alone, chest pain is responsible for around 1 million visits to the emergency department every year. International guidelines recommend that individuals presenting with chest pain are admitted to hospital for testing for very high levels of troponin (above the 99th percentile)--a sign that a heart attack has occurred. Current approaches for assessing patients with suspected heart attacks either require admission into hospital or lengthy stays in the emergency department for repeat testing. Until now, whether new high-sensitivity cardiac troponin tests could identify very low-risk patients who may be suitable for immediate and safe discharge from the emergency department was unknown.\n\nThe test used in this study is more sensitive than the standard version and can detect far lower levels of troponin in the blood. Using this test, troponin levels were measured in over 6000 patients with chest pain admitted to four hospitals in Scotland and the USA. Dr Shah and colleagues prospectively evaluated the negative predictive value (the probability that patients were not at risk) of heart attack or subsequent death from a heart condition after 30 days for a range of troponin concentrations.\n\nThe researchers found that a troponin threshold of <5 ng/L at presentation identified around two-thirds (61%) of patients at very low risk of heart attack and may have been eligible for early, safe discharge--with a high negative predictive value of 99.6%. This high negative predictive value persisted irrespective of age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, or prior cardiovascular disease. At one year, these patients had a three times lower risk of heart attack and cardiac death than those who had troponin levels 5 ng/L or higher.\n\nAccording to Dr Shah, \"Over the last two decades the number of hospital admissions due to chest pain has tripled. The overwhelming majority of these patients do not have a heart attack. This study shows that low plasma cardiac troponin concentrations at presentation identify up to two-thirds of patients who are at very low risk of heart attack and could be safely discharged from the Emergency Department. Use of this approach is likely to have major benefits for both patients and healthcare providers.\"[2]\n\nWriting in a linked Comment, Louise Cullen and William Parsonage from the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Queensland, Australia, and Martin Than from Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand, say, \"The ultimate validation for the safety and efficacy of discharging patients with cardiac troponin concentrations less than 5 ng/L will be the report of clinical outcomes after this threshold is implemented in routine clinical practice...Finally, what further assessment, if any, is needed for those patients identified as low risk and suitable for early discharge? Trials are needed to assess the safety and effectiveness of clinical pathways that involve no further testing for such patients.\"\n\nThis study was funded by the British Heart Foundation and Chief Scientists Office (Scotland).\n\n[1] A troponin test measures the level of troponin proteins in the blood. These proteins are released when the heart muscle has been damaged, like during a heart attack. The more damage there is to the heart, the greater the amount of troponin there will be in the blood. Even a slight increase in the troponin level will often mean there has been some damage to the heart. Very high levels of troponin are a sign that a heart attack has occurred.\n\n[2] Quotes direct from author and cannot be found in text of Article.", "question": "Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The release never explicitly states whether this is now being used, either at the study sites involved or elsewhere.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "MONDAY, June 6, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- There's too little evidence to say definitively whether treating early, localized prostate cancer with radiation is a better option than \"watchful waiting,\" new research finds.\n\nIn a study funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), researchers from Tufts University reviewed the available literature on radiation and prostate cancer, including 10 randomized controlled trials and 65 observational studies.\n\nThey concluded there was \"insufficient evidence\" to say with certainty whether radiation treatment compared to watchful waiting is more likely to save lives.\n\n\"We just don't have sufficient information to say much of anything,\" said Dr. Stanley Ip, an assistant professor of medicine at Tufts University Medical Center.\n\nIn part, that's because researchers found no randomized controlled trials -- considered the gold standard of research -- that compared radiation therapy with watching waiting, Ip said. Though there were observational studies, those may be biased because men who opt to hold off on treatment may be those whose tumors are lower risk to begin with, he said.\n\nThe study is published in the June 6 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nWatchful waiting -- which does not involve cancer treatment -- means having regular exams while keeping an eye on the tumor to see if it grows or spreads. It is usually recommended when doctors feel someone's advanced age will allow them to outlive the generally slow-moving cancer or when someone has other conditions that are more likely to prove lethal.\n\nMen who are diagnosed with early prostate cancer -- meaning it's confined to the prostate gland and has not spread -- are confronted with a bewildering array of options for treating it: surgery; radiation; drugs to deprive the tumor of the hormone androgen that may drive its growth; or watchful waiting.\n\nIn 2008, AHRQ also commissioned a review of studies on other prostate cancer treatment options, but that report could not draw conclusions on the best approach either.\n\n\"What all of these analyses have found is there is very limited data that allows us to determine which of these approaches in the best approach,\" said Dr. Durado Brooks, director of prostate cancer for the American Cancer Society.\n\nBrooks said more comparative effectiveness research, which compares different kinds of treatments, is needed.\n\nIn the meantime, what are men diagnosed with early prostate cancer to do?\n\nMen and their doctors need to consider what the tumor looks like under the microscope, which can help gauge how aggressive it may be. They should also consider age and overall health status, including whether or not the patient has other conditions more likely to cause death than the prostate cancer.\n\nFinally, patients and their doctors should weight the potential debilitating side effects of the treatments, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction, against how comfortable the man is with holding off on treatment, experts say.\n\n\"Men need to learn as much as they can about the possible outcomes and benefits of the various treatments and the potential side effects, and choose which direction they are most comfortable with,\" Brooks said.\n\nIn the current review, researchers found several trials that compared different doses of radiation and different types of radiation therapy, including external beam radiation therapy, in which a radiation is delivered through a beam through the skin, or brachytherapy, in which radioactive isotopes are delivered via injection into the prostate.\n\nFor those methods, too, there was too little research to say with confidence which method was superior in preventing deaths from prostate cancer, the researchers said. Retrospective studies, however, found that radiation treatments were associated with increased urinary or bowel problems, compared with no treatment or no initial treatment.\n\nThere was also \"moderate strength evidence\" that a higher external beam radiation was more effective than a lower dose.\n\nTaken together, the review \"does point out that based on current evidence, doctors should not be telling their patients that this form of radiation is better than that form,\" Brooks said. \"Some of the distinctions being made are not really supported by the evidence.\"\n\nProton beam therapy in particular is expensive, but according to this report, there isn't enough evidence to show it's any better than other option.\n\nRadiation, he noted, may be the best option for men whose tumors have spread outside the gland, since simply removing the prostate gland surgically is not likely to be as effective, he said.\n\nThe American Cancer Society estimates that in 2009, approximately 192,000 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer and approximately 27,000 men died of the disease.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute has more on prostate cancer.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Not applicable.\u00a0 The story didn\u2019t explicitly address the availability of radiation facilities, but that wasn\u2019t necessary.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "Nov. 5, 2012 (Los Angeles) -- An IV infusion of \"good\" HDL cholesterol seems to rapidly remove cholesterol out of plaque-clogged arteries following a heart attack, a small, early study suggests.\n\nThe goal of the new treatment is to reduce the high risk of a second heart attack in people who have had a heart attack.\n\nIn the year after a heart attack, about 12% of people have a second heart attack or stroke.

Diagnosis and disease monitoring relies on several parameters, including clinical examination, MRI, cerebrospinal fluid assessment, and electrophysiology.\n\nMS is a chronic disease, so current diagnostic and monitoring tests are costly and still have limited utility to discriminate between different stages of the disease.\n\nIn addition to identifying biomarkers that distinguish healthy people from those with MS, the researchers identified nine unique micro-RNA molecules that differentiate between two MS sub-types: relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and progressive MS.\n\nRelapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) affects 70 percent of people and often evolves into a secondary progressive form of MS. 10-15 percent of people with MS are diagnosed with a progressive form of the disease from the outset known as primary progressive MS.\n\nThe team also validated eight out of nine micro-RNA molecules in an independent group of progressive MS cases, confirming the reproducibility of the findings.\n\n\"This is the first demonstration that micro-RNAs associated with circulating exosomes in blood are informative biomarkers not only for the diagnosis of MS, but in predicting disease subtypes with a high degree of accuracy,\" said Associate Professor Michael Buckland, Head of the Department of Neuropathology at RPA Hospital and the Brain and Mind Centre, University of Sydney.\n\nThe research was made possible through the generosity of patients at the Brain & Mind Centre's multidisciplinary Multiple Sclerosis Clinic, a collaborative service offered by Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, and the University of Sydney. The research was funded by an Incubator grant from MS Research Australia.\n\n\"This blood test may allow people with MS to begin treatment earlier, and identify the most appropriate treatment for their condition,\" said Dr Matthew Miles, CEO MS Research Australia.\n\n\"This, in turn may lead to fewer relapses and a slower loss of brain volume, resulting in slowing or potentially halting progression of the disease for the person living with MS. It will also help remove the uncertainty surrounding which sub type of the disease an individual has and therefore be a catalyst for better outcomes for all people with MS.\"\n\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS).\n\nThe research team assessed the utility of microRNAs (miRNA) in serum (blood) exosomes as biomarkers of MS disease.\n\nMicro-RNA are small non-coding RNA that control many genes and processes vital for cellular life such as metabolism, development and the immune system. They are called miRNA because they are very short, only 18-25 letters long. Science has so far identified about 1800 human miRNAs.\n\nExosomes are nano-sized particles shed by almost all cell types in the body and are packed with micro-RNAs and other types of small RNA. The research team has shown previously that some micro-RNAs are selectively packaged into exosomes for release from the cell.\n\nExosomes are tiny packages released by both healthy and diseased cells in the body. They circulate in blood and can be purified in their millions from a single vial of blood. Dubbed the biological equivalent of 'tweeting', the exosomes circulate throughout the body and can deliver their cargo of information to multiple cells in almost real-time.\n\nIn inflammatory diseases such as MS, there is a significant increase in circulating exosome concentrations.\n\n\"In studying the blood exosomes of healthy volunteers and patients with MS, the research team identified a 'molecular signature' of MS that not only correctly diagnoses MS, but also discriminates between patients with different stages of disease,\" Associate Professor Buckland said.\n\n\"Exosomes released by brain cells circulating in the blood, so they offer an easily accessible way to monitor diseases of the brain. We are only now starting to wake up to their enormous potential as clinical tests.\"\n\nGiven exosomes can cross the blood-brain barrier, it is likely that some of the circulating exosomes in MS patients come from affected central nervous system cells or the associated inflammatory milieu.\n\nThe researchers hypothesised that physiological changes associated with MS and its progression is reflected in differences in serum exosomal micro-RNAs.\n\nUsing next generation sequencing and integrative bioinformatics they found that serum exosome micro-RNA profiles not only distinguish MS from healthy controls, but also distinguish relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) from progressive MS with high accuracy.\n\nAssociate Professor Michael Buckland is Head of the Molecular Neuropathology at the University of Sydney and Head of the Department of Neuropathology at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.", "question": "Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "This research is basic, so one might expect a reader to infer that the blood test is not yet available.\u00a0 But the text could have reinforced that by indicating what next steps need to be taken in order to validate this discovery and move it into clinical use.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "The defense system that doctors are trying to breach evolved to keep out toxins and microbes.

But how long the effect will last remains to be seen.\n\nDespite a beautiful scan, the first patient who was treated died in October, from pneumonia and the spread of glioblastoma to his brainstem.\n\nInnovations are desperately needed to make headway against glioblastoma, which is \u201cone of the most deadly tumors that exist in humans,\u201d said Dr. Russell Lonser, chairman of surgical neurology at the National Institutes of Health.\n\n\u201cThis is a very good start,\u201d Dr. Lonser said. \u201cThe early data is very interesting and exciting.\u201d\n\nThe complexity of a study like this goes beyond the science. Clinical trials are also a complicated pact, emotionally and ethically, between desperate patients and doctors who must balance their ambition as researchers against their duty as clinicians, and must walk a fine line between offering too much hope and not enough.\n\n\u201cI tell patients, \u2018I\u2019m going to try to cure your disease, but so far glioblastoma is an incurable disease,\u2019 \u201d Dr. Boockvar said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic,\u201d Mr. Sugrue said one morning in September, after scheduling a second brain operation. But he had tears in his eyes.\n\nThere are about 10,000 new cases of glioblastoma a year in the United States, mostly in people over 45. The tumors are notorious for growing back like weeds even after being cut out and blasted with chemotherapy and radiation, and they are nearly always fatal. With the best treatment, the median survival time is about 15 months.\n\nBut in the last five years, the number of patients who survive 2 years has increased to 25 percent, from 8 percent, largely because doctors began using a chemotherapy pill called temozolomide, or Temodar, along with radiation (Temodar is believed to seep through the blood-brain barrier).\n\nDr. Boockvar said he thought that if he could just keep patients alive for two years, more advances might come along and give them time.\n\n\u201cThe glioblastoma population is very studyable, unfortunately, because the prognosis is so grim,\u201d he said.\n\nPatients often wind up on the front lines of research, figuring they have little to lose and hoping they will be lucky enough to test the big breakthrough. More than 500 studies for people with glioblastoma are listed on the government Web site www.clinicaltrials.gov.\n\nMr. Sugrue, who lives in Stamford, Conn., with his wife, Donna, and their children Molly and Tim, began having headaches in April. He thought he had a sinus problem. But a scan found a brain tumor nearly the size of a golf ball. A local doctor referred him to Dr. Boockvar. He had the standard treatment: surgery, temozolomide pills and six weeks of radiation, which ended on June 25.\n\nBy July, an ominous bright spot on his M.R.I. scan suggested that the tumor might already be growing back. He continued chemotherapy, but the spot kept enlarging.\n\nBy mid-September, the Sugrues were back in Dr. Boockvar\u2019s office to plan their next step. Stubbly hair was growing in on Mr. Sugrue\u2019s scalp, except for a bare patch, around an arcing scar above his right ear. His eyes, bright blue with thick, dark lashes that gave him a boyish look, searched the doctor\u2019s face.\n\nThe headaches had returned. New scans, displayed on a computer screen, showed signs of brain swelling and bright spots that should not have been there. Dr. Boockvar recommended more surgery and then chemotherapy with Avastin, which had recently been approved for recurring glioblastoma.\n\nIt was approved for intravenous use \u2014 to be dripped into a vein, usually in the arm \u2014 but he said Mr. Sugrue would be an ideal candidate for his study, in which the drug would be infused directly into an artery in the brain, producing levels at least 50 times what the intravenous route could achieve. One other patient had been treated that way, and M.R.I. scans showed that recurring tumors seemed to have melted away.\n\nMr. Sugrue said he was all for it, even though Dr. Boockvar warned him that the drug was no magic bullet. Then Dr. Boockvar ticked off the risks from a second brain operation.\n\n\u201cI have to quote you a 5 percent risk you\u2019ll be visibly weak,\u201d he said. \u201cA 1 percent chance of paralysis on the left side.\u201d\n\nMr. Sugrue wiped his eyes and began to apologize for losing his composure, but the surgeon cut him off and said, \u201cIn neurosurgery they say that if you don\u2019t make your patient cry, you haven\u2019t gotten informed consent.\u201d\n\nThe trial grew out of a conversation about a year ago between Dr. Boockvar and Dr. Riina, an expert in using microcatheters to treat strokes.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Why can\u2019t you infuse chemotherapy for my brain tumor patients?\u2019 \u201d Dr. Boockvar recalled. \u201cAnd he said: \u2018I can. Just show me what you want to do.\u2019 \u201d\n\nDr. Riina said, \u201cTechnically, I can go anywhere in your brain.\u201d\n\nHe said microcatheter technology had advanced \u201clight-years\u201d in the last decade and was just waiting for a new drug to come along for glioblastoma.\n\nThey wrote up a plan to test what they called \u201csuperselective intra-arterial cerebral infusion\u201d of Avastin in 30 patients with glioblastomas that had recurred after standard treatment. Each patient would receive just one treatment directed into the brain, followed weeks later by a series of intravenous treatments with Avastin.\n\nTheir study involves a technique first developed about 30 years ago, which uses mannitol to open the blood-brain barrier temporarily to get chemotherapy into the brain. Mannitol pulls water out of the tightly packed cells lining the capillaries so that they shrink and pull away from one another, opening up gaps through which drug molecules can pass into the brain.\n\nThe technique was developed by Dr. Edward A. Neuwelt, a neurosurgeon at Oregon Health Sciences University and the Veterans Affairs Hospital in Portland. Its best results have been in people with a rare type of brain tumor called a primary central nervous system lymphoma. But it has not been helpful with glioblastoma, because until recently there was no chemotherapy to infuse that would have much effect on those tumors.\n\nDr. Neuwelt said that Avastin had helped to renew interest in opening the blood-brain barrier but that researchers disagreed about whether the drug would lend itself to that use.\n\nAvastin starves tumors by blocking the growth of new blood vessels, which they need to survive. Dr. Boockvar said microcatheters should increase the odds of success by delivering a high dose of the drug directly to where it was needed most. Earlier research with other drugs used larger catheters inserted into the carotid arteries, which feed the entire brain \u2014 meaning that the tumor did not receive the most concentrated dose and that healthy brain tissue was exposed to the toxic drugs.\n\nBy mid-November, the researchers had treated five patients, including Mr. Sugrue; they first infused mannitol, waited five minutes and then sprayed in the Avastin. In all the patients\u2019 M.R.I. scans, the telltale bright spots that marked tumor growth faded away after the treatment.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you what it means,\u201d Dr. Boockvar said. \u201cNobody knows.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the death of the first patient was a reminder that glioblastoma can invade other parts of the brain and the spinal fluid and that the highly localized spray of Avastin might miss deadly seeds of cancer.\n\nBut Dr. Boockvar remained hopeful for the remaining patients, describing the scans as \u201castronomically far better than I had anticipated.\u201d\n\nMr. Sugrue was still in the hospital in late September when Dr. Boockvar burst into his room and got him out of bed to look at his own before-and-after scans.\n\n\u201cHe took me to this room with all these computers and said, \u2018I\u2019ve got to show you this,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Sugrue recalled. \u201cThis M.R.I. was a thing of beauty. I\u2019m excited that he\u2019s excited. That means a lot to me.\u201d\n\nDr. Boockvar said: \u201cAvastin may not be the best drug for this delivery technique. What\u2019s exciting about our results is that we\u2019ve proven there is a local effect.\n\n\u201cSuppose someone said, \u2018I have much better drug.\u2019 Now I can say I at least have a delivery system.\u201d\n\nWith patients, Dr. Boockvar tries to walk a fine line, trying to level with them and yet not rob them of all hope. He knows the emotional toll that a cancer diagnosis can take: his own father had leukemia for about eight years and died in September. Mrs. Sugrue said the doctor urged her and her husband to resist doing an Internet search for glioblastoma because they would just read that it was a death sentence.\n\nThey said they tried to follow his advice, but when the subject of prognosis came up in an interview, both had tears in their eyes.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t ask the question if you don\u2019t want the answer,\u201d Mrs. Sugrue said. \u201cWhat will be, will be.

ALA is plant-based and found in such edible seeds as flaxseed and in oils, such as soy, canola and hemp oil. EPA and DHA are found in marine life, such as fish, algae and phytoplankton.\n\nPublished in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, the study involved feeding the different types of omega-3s to mice with a highly aggressive form of human breast cancer called HER-2. HER-2 affects 25per cent of women and has a poor prognosis.\n\nMa exposed the mice to either the plant-based or the marine-based omega-3s, beginning in utero.\n\n\"The mice were exposed to the different omega-3s even before tumours developed, which allowed us to compare how effective the fatty acids are at prevention,\" said Ma. \"It's known that EPA and DHA can inhibit breast tumour growth, but no one has looked directly at how effective these omega-3s are compared to ALA.\"\n\nMa found overall exposure to marine-based omega-3s reduced the size of the tumours by 60 to 70 per cent and the number of tumours by 30 per cent.\n\nHowever, higher doses of the plant-based fatty acid were required to deliver the same impact as the marine-based omega-3s.\n\nOmega-3s prevent and fight cancer by turning on genes associated with the immune system and blocking tumour growth pathways, said Ma.\n\n\"It seems EPA and DHA are more effective at this. In North America, we don't get enough omega-3s from seafood, so there lies an opportunity to improve our diet and help prevent the risk of breast cancer.\"\n\nBased on the doses given in the study, Ma said humans should consume two to three servings of fish a week to have the same effect.\n\nBesides certain foods containing EPA and DHA, supplements and functional foods, such as omega-3 eggs or DHA milk, can offer similar cancer prevention effects, he added.\n\nThe next step is to investigate the effects of omega-3s on other forms of breast cancer.\n\n\"Seeing the significant benefits omega-3s can have in combatting a highly aggressive form of breast cancer means omega-3s will likely be beneficial for other types of cancer.\"", "question": "Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Fatty fish is widely available.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "People treated in the emergency room for a sprain, strain or fracture are generally given opioids to help them cope with the pain, often leaving with a prescription for opioids, too.

Previous research had indicated people with high homocysteine levels were at greater risk.\n\nAlthough the new studies did show that the vitamins cut homocysteine levels, that did not translate into a reduction in the risk for heart attacks or strokes.\n\nIn the first study, Eva Lonn of McMaster University in Canada and her colleagues gave 5,522 Americans and Canadians who had heart disease or diabetes either the supplements or a placebo for five years. Although homocysteine levels among those taking the supplements fell, they were no less likely to die from a heart attack or stroke, the researchers found.\n\nIn the second study, Kaare Harald Bonaa of the University of Tromso in Norway and colleagues researchers gave 3,749 patients who had had a heart attack within the previous week the vitamins or a placebo for more than three years on average.

The research was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the March of Dimes Foundation.\n\nOmega 3 fatty acids are a class of nutrients considered essential for neural and retinal development during pregnancy. They are often obtained through diet by eating fish. But, concerns about mercury contamination in fish have led to recommendations that advise pregnant women to limit their fish consumption. Pregnant women are also advised to avoid certain fish, such as swordfish, altogether.\n\nTherefore, the current study looked at DHA supplements derived from algae. Ramakrishnan said there are no concerns about mercury contamination in DHA from algae.\n\nMore than 800 Mexican women were included in the study. Half were randomly selected to be in the treatment group while the other half received a daily placebo pill. The treatment group received 400 milligrams of DHA each day, beginning when they were between 18 and 22 weeks pregnant. Treatment continued at least until the birth of the baby.\n\nRamakrishnan said Mexican women tend to be deficient in DHA, much like many American women are.\n\nThe babies were assessed at 1, 3 and 6 months of age, and the mothers completed questionnaires about their babies' health. To aid their recall, the mothers were also asked to keep a diary, recording any illness symptoms.\n\nBabies in the DHA group had a 24 percent drop in the odds of having a combination of cold symptoms at 1 month compared to babies whose mothers were given a placebo.

An already approved drug could be quickly available and would then be the first breast cancer prevention drug.\n\nAbout one in eight women will develop invasive breast cancer over the course of her lifetime. Causes can be the use of synthetic sex hormones and other environmental factors, but also gene mutations like in the BRCA1 gene (BReast CAncer). US actress Angelina Jolie who underwent a preventive double mastectomy is the most famous carrier of a \u201efaulty\u201c BRCA1 gene. On average, women with this mutation have an up to 87% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. Tumors usually develop early in life. Until now, prophylactic surgery is the only procedure which significantly reduces the breast cancer risk, but which is also often associated with postoperative complications.\n\nIn 2010, Josef Penninger, the scientific director of IMBA in Vienna and his team have shown that sex hormones can trigger breast cancer (Schramek et al., Nature) through proteins called RANKL and its receptor RANK, which are key factors in bone metabolism. RANKL and RANK also link sex hormones to breast cells by providing signals telling the breast cells to grow. This occurs normally in every woman during pregnancy and the menstruation cycle. However, if deregulated, mammary cells start to divide and multiply and fail to die when they should, ultimately resulting in breast cancer.\n\nA multinational research effort now made the discovery that RANKL is also the main driver of BRCA1 mutation-driven breast cancer. In the current study, Verena Sigl, graduate student from Penninger's research group, showed that blocking the RANKL/RANK system in BRCA1 mutant mice led to largely normal mammary glands whereas invasive carcinomas could be found in the control group. To determine the relevance of their results for humans, scientists in Vienna and Toronto isolated breast tissue cells from women who had undergone preventive mastectomy because of their BRCA1 mutation. In the human cell culture, too, RANKL inhibition led to a significant reduction of growth and spreading of breast tissue cells. Moreover, the scientists \u2013 together with colleagues in Barcelona and from the CIMBA* consortium mapping more than 23,000 women \u2013 showed that genetic variants in the RANK gene are associated with a higher risk of developing breast cancer in women who carry BRCA1 and also BRCA2 mutations.\n\n\"Our finding is so exciting because there is already an approved drug against RANKL called \u201eDenosumab\u201d. It is an antibody with very few side effects, which binds tightly to RANKL, thereby inhibiting its ability to act. Based on our discovery, the already approved drug Denosumab or other future drugs that will block RANKL/RANK, could be used for breast cancer prevention in BRCA mutation carriers,\" explains Verena Sigl.\n\nScientists at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore have already tried the preventive use of a RANKL blocking drug in mice. Animals carrying BRCA1 mutations were divided into two groups. In the control group multiple early breast cancer lesions developed. The second group received RANKL blockade treatment for prevention with the result that virtually no malignant changes in breast tissue could be observed even over a longer period of observation.\n\nCareful phase III clinical trials are now needed to confirm the efficacy in humans. Thereafter, any woman who has been tested positive for a BRCA1 mutation could take RANKL blockade as prevention measure to reduce her dramatically increased breast cancer risk. Josef Penninger adds: \u201cThis work is a great example of an international collaboration of many scientists with one grand vision: Prevention of breast cancer. Cancer prevention is one of the key issues we face in medicine today, a world where much fewer women will get breast cancer in the first place. We have also shown that RANKL/RANK are critically involved in sex hormone-driven breast cancer.

MorNuCo Laboratories is elated to share these results with the public, as early detection is widely considered the corner stone of an effective strategy to reduce cancer-related deaths.\n\nMalignant mesothelioma is an aggressive and almost uniformly fatal tumor caused primarily by exposure to asbestos. In this study, the serum presence of a mesothelioma-specific form of the ENOX2 protein (a recently identified marker of malignancy) was found within the serum of asbestos-exposed individuals an average of 6.2 years in advance of clinical symptoms by using the ONCOblot tissue of origin cancer detection test.\n\nSerum samples that were collected from asbestos-exposed individuals prior to the development of mesothelioma as part of a cancer surveillance program were tested for ENOX2 protein presence to determine how long in advance of clinical symptoms that the mesothelioma-specific ENOX2 protein transcript variants could be detected.\n\nThe results of this study showed that two mesothelioma-specific ENOX2 protein transcript variants were detected in the serum of asbestos-exposed individuals 4-10 years prior to clinical diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma, an exciting sign of progress in the cancer detection field.\n\n\"The completion of this trial is an exciting new chapter for our work,\" says Nick Miner, Vice President of Business Development. \"Although asbestos-induced mesothelioma is a very specific example of early detection, we are currently pursuing larger-scale clinical trials to investigate the utility of the ENOX2 protein marker to predict the onset of cancers of other tissues of origin as well.\" Miner continued.\n\nAlthough the fight against cancer often appears to be an overwhelmingly intransigent problem, significant progress is being made regarding the development of additional tools for cancer detection, such as the ONCOblot Test.\n\nThe ONCOblot\u00ae Test was developed and created by Dr. D.

Opioid overdoses continue to plague communities nation-wide. The SCSO recognizes this effective medical intervention as another way to help combat the opioid overdose threat to our community.\"\n\nOpioid emergencies, such as an accidental overdose, are a growing public health epidemic. On average, 79 people die from opioids, including prescription opioid analgesics and heroin, everyday in the United States; most occur outside of medical settings, such as in a home.[1],[2] Approximately 136,000 opioid overdose emergency department visits occur each year.[3] Many communities throughout the United States are facing a devastating heroin epidemic. Additionally, there are nearly two times the number of prescription opioid-related deaths as compared to heroin-related deaths.1 On average, 3,300 children five years old and younger are admitted to emergency departments each year due to accidental opioid exposure.[4]\n\nLife-threatening opioid emergencies result in respiratory and/or central nervous system depression. Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression (OIRD) is the most important serious adverse effect of opioids as it can be immediately life-threatening.[5] In addition to the risk of an opioid overdose associated with an opioid use disorder, there may be an increased risk of life-threatening OIRD even when patients take a prescribed dose of an opioid as directed. For example, taking high doses of opioids, taking an opioid in combination with other drugs (e.g., benzodiazepines) or alcohol, or if there is a history of certain medical conditions (e.g., COPD, severe asthma) places individuals at significantly higher risk for life-threatening OIRD.[6],[7],[8] Seconds count when a life-threatening OIRD event occurs. Without rapid intervention, brain injury or death can occur in as little as 4 minutes.[9] Most life-threatening OIRD emergencies occur in the home and are witnessed by family and friends who may be in the best position to intervene quickly.[10]\n\nNaloxone is an opioid antagonist that displaces opioids from the receptors in the brain, temporarily reversing the life-threatening breathing problems that can occur during an opioid emergency.[11]\n\nEVZIO (naloxone HCl injection) Auto-injector is an opioid antagonist indicated for the emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose, as manifested by respiratory and/or central nervous system depression. EVZIO is intended for immediate administration as emergency therapy in settings where opioids may be present. EVZIO is not a substitute for emergency medical care. EVZIO is an intelligent Auto-injection system that provides simple, on-the-spot voice and visual guidance. EVZIO is small, easy-to-carry and easy-to-use to help patients and caregivers keep it on hand so they can take fast, confident action administering EVZIO during an opioid emergency. Results averaged across two adequate and well-controlled usability studies demonstrate more than 94% of users can correctly administer EVZIO without training, and 100% with training.[12] Each EVZIO pre-filled, single-use, hand-held Auto-injector delivers a single 0.4 mg dose of naloxone. Each EVZIO prescription comes with two Auto-injectors and a Trainer.

Death, coma, and encephalopathy have been reported as sequelae of these events. Excessive doses of naloxone hydrochloride in postoperative patients have resulted in significant reversal of analgesia and have caused agitation.\n\nAbrupt reversal of opioid effects in persons who were physically dependent on opioids has precipitated signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal including: body aches, fever, sweating, runny nose, sneezing, piloerection, yawning, weakness, shivering or trembling, nervousness, restlessness or irritability, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, abdominal cramps, increased blood pressure, and tachycardia. In the neonate, opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms also included: convulsions, excessive crying, and hyperactive reflexes.\n\nYou are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

Testing revealed Evangelina was born with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency, also called SCID or \"bubble baby\" disease.\n\nIt's a genetic disorder that leaves the body with a weakened immune system, making infants extremely vulnerable to illness. It affects cells that play important roles in helping the immune system battle bacteria, viruses and fungi that can cause infections. Even the common cold can be deadly.\n\nSymptoms of the disease are frequently first noticed very early in life, as was the case with Evangelina.

Julia Belluz will sift through the research and consult with experts in the field to figure out how science can help us live happier and healthier lives.\n\nHave a question? Use our submission form or ask @juliaoftoronto on Twitter.\n\nIs running really a better form of exercise than walking, given that running can lead to more injuries?\n\nAt Vox, I sit near health reporter Sarah Kliff, who trains for half-marathons and triathlons with a casualness most people reserve for grocery shopping. But Sarah\u2019s also suffered with plantar fasciitis and a stress fracture. At times, she's hobbled around in running shoes for months because everything else hurt too much, and even sported a big blue brace on her left leg to help cushion the tiny cracks in the bones of her foot brought on from too much wear and tear.\n\nIn many ways, Sarah is a perfect case study in how to think about the benefits and risks of running versus walking. Running has greater health benefits than walking (Sarah is super fit), but it also carries a much bigger risk of injury (see Sarah\u2019s foot brace).\n\n\n\nSo which effect dominates? To find out, I first searched for \"randomized control trials\" and \"systematic reviews\" on running, walking, and exercise at PubMed health (a free search engine for health research) and in Google Scholar. I wanted to see what the highest-quality evidence \u2014 trials and reviews are the gold standard \u2014 said about the relative risks and benefits of these two forms of exercise.\n\nIt was immediately apparent that running can lead to more injuries, and the risk goes up as running programs get more intense. Studies have found that runners have significantly higher injury rates than walkers (one study found that young men who run or jog had a 25 percent higher risk of injuries than walkers), and that ultramarathoners are at an even greater risk. The main running-related injuries include tibia stress syndrome, Achilles tendon injuries, and plantar fasciitis.\n\nOverall, more than half of people who run will experience some sort of injury from doing so, while the percentage of walkers who will get hurt is around 1 percent. Interestingly, it seems you can walk pretty much endlessly without any increased risk of hurting yourself.\n\nThat running hurts people shouldn't be surprising. As this study described, \"Running produces ground reaction forces that are approximately 2.5 times body weight, while the ground reaction force during walking is in the range of 1.2 times body weight.\" You're also more likely to trip and fall while running than you are during a walk.\n\nJogging even 5 to 10 minutes per day can reduce the risk of death from all causes I also learned about some of the incredible health benefits of going fast: Even five to 10 minutes per day of jogging at around 6 miles per hour can reduce the risk of death from cardiovascular disease and other causes. Joggers have been found to live longer than non-joggers even after adjusting for other factors \u2014 a difference of 3.8 years for men and 4.7 years for women.\n\nThat said, research has found that walking carries significant health benefits, as well. Some studies suggest that you can extend your life and stave off disease by simply walking \u2014 and the more, the better.\n\nAll this research, while illuminating, didn\u2019t offer up any clear conclusions on whether running or walking was better for you overall. So I asked some of the world\u2019s leading researchers in this area. Their conclusion? You need to consider the trade-offs.\n\n\"Running moderately prolongs life more than walking does,\" said Peter Schnohr, a clinical cardiologist who has researched many aspects of exercise and health. The key word there is \"moderately.\" Schnohr warned of the emerging research that doing a lot of endurance exercise over the long term (like triathlon training) can lead to heart problems. Overall, there's a U-shaped association between running and mortality, he said. Too little isn't helpful for health, but too much might be harmful.\n\n\n\n \"The most favorable regimen is two to three running days per week, at a slow or average pace\"\n\n\"The most favorable [regimen] is two to three running days per week, at a slow or average pace,\" Schnohr advised. \"Running every day, at a fast speed, more than 4 hours per week is not as favorable.\" And for those who don't like running, he noted, \"Fast walking, not slow, also prolongs life. I can\u2019t tell how much.\"\n\nDutch researcher Luiz Carlos Hespanhol pointed out that in general, running simply delivers health benefits more efficiently than walking does. This study, for example, found that five minutes of running per day is as beneficial as 15 minutes of walking. Hespanhol also said that after one year of training just two hours a week, runners lose weight, reduce their body fat, lower their resting heart rates, and drive down their blood serum triglycerides (fat in the blood). There's even evidence that running can have positive effects on tension, depression, and anger.\n\nEven so, Hespanhol wasn't a total cheerleader for running. A good walking regimen can have similar benefits, he noted. So on running versus walking, it really depends on your values and preferences: \"One could choose walking instead of running as a mode of physical activity based on injury risks, since walking is less risky than running,\" he explained. Or alternatively: \"One could choose running because the health benefits are larger and come faster, in a shorter period of time.\"\n\nTo recap: Running improves your health more efficiently than walking does and has greater health benefits per time invested. But even a small amount of running carries more injury risk than walking. And a lot of running (i.e., ultramarathon training) can well be harmful, while the same is never true for walking.\n\nWhere does this leave us? All the exercise researchers seemed to agree on one thing: that the best exercise routine is the one you'll actually do. So the answer to the running versus walking question will probably vary from person to person. If you prefer one over the other, stick with that. And if you still can't decide, Hespanhol suggested this: \"Why not do both \u2014 running and walking \u2014 in order to get the best of each?\"\n\nSend your questions to Julia via the submission form or @juliaoftoronto on Twitter.

The diets and exercise programs varied, but could include low-glycemic diets and unsupervised exercise.\n\nWomen who took part in diet, exercise or combination programs were about 20 percent less likely than women in standard-care groups to gain too much weight while pregnant, the researchers report.\n\nThe women who took part in diet, exercise and combination programs were also less likely to develop high blood pressure during pregnancy, compared to those in the standard care group.\n\nThere was no clear benefit among the women in the diet and exercise groups when the researchers looked at other complications, such as cesarean delivery, but it did look like there may be some benefit, they write.\n\nWhile the new study generally did not show fewer complications in the diet and exercise group, Dr. Loralei Thornburg told Reuters Health that it\u2019s good that there was no increase in complications.\n\n\u201cThis was very reassuring that there wasn\u2019t an increased risk of preterm birth with moderate exercise,\u201d said Thornburg, a high-risk pregnancy expert at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York.\n\n\u201cMost people gain more weight than they probably should during pregnancy,\u201d Thornburg, who was not involved with the review, told Reuters Health.\n\nShe said women who gain too much weight may not be able to lose it after the baby is born. Then, during the next pregnancy the woman is already heavier and that may increase the risk of complications.\n\n\u201cIn the next pregnancy, if you don\u2019t get it off, you may go from obese to very obese,\u201d Thornburg said.\n\nShe cautioned, however, that women should check with their doctors before starting a diet and exercise program during pregnancy.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "It might have been useful to give readers a sense of\u00a0whether diet and/or exercise programs are routinely available to pregnant women (either through their obstetricians or in the community).

Off the campaign trail, there's intense debate over using opioid meds to kick opioid addiction.\n\nScott Jernigan became addicted to painkillers after his failed back surgery. His doctor had prescribed a month\u2019s worth of OxyContin, the signature drug of the nationwide painkiller addiction epidemic, and Jernigan followed it to the letter. Soon, the well-off businessman, husband, and father of two from Florida was an addict, buying pills on the street. In the last year of addiction, Jernigan snorted away a house, a boat, and almost his life. Even his dealer told him he needed to cut back. \u201cA drug dealer telling you, \u2018Hey man, you really ought to slow down,\u2019\u201d Jernigan, 52, told BuzzFeed News. \u201cCan you imagine?\u201d He\u2019s just one of an estimated 2.1 million people across the United States who are addicted to opioid painkillers like oxycodone and hydrocodone (sold as OxyContin and Vicodin, respectively). Every day, 44 Americans die from a painkiller overdose. The central irony of the painkiller \"pandemic,\" as Sen. Jean Shaheen of New Hampshire called it in a January Senate hearing, is that it\u2019s easy to prescribe painkillers but hard to prescribe medication to treat an addiction. These medications, notably the drug buprenorphine, are not panaceas, but studies have shown that they\u2019re the best choice to help addicts get off painkillers. Trouble is, they\u2019re also opioids themselves, and can result in dependency and highs all on their own, turning into street drugs in the last decade. Partly as a result, relatively few doctors are allowed to prescribe them, and these docs are limited in how many recovering addicts they can treat. In Shaheen\u2019s Feb. 9 primary state of New Hampshire, the drug epidemic ranks as the No. 1 concern of voters in polls. There, presidential candidates such as Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey are calling for treating addiction as \u201ca disease, not a moral failing.\u201d And a move is afoot in Congress and the White House to ease restrictions on medications meant to fight addiction. Last Tuesday, the Obama administration announced that it is seeking $1.1 billion to fight the opioid epidemic, including a $920 million boost to medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction. And on Thursday, the FDA unveiled a new strategy for curbing rampant painkiller prescriptions, which includes making medication treatments more widely available. \u201cI think the situation is sinking in,\u201d Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon told BuzzFeed News. \u201cIt is so out of control, and there is a real opportunity for action in this Congress.\u201d Pharma, meanwhile, is ramping up its marketing of these medications, pitching them as pain relievers themselves and releasing new forms such as a patch and a mint-flavored tablet. One new option awaiting FDA approval, an implant, Jernigan credits with saving his life.\n\nTwo years into Jernigan\u2019s addiction, at a stage when he was getting high only to stave off withdrawal, listless and miserable, another addict told him about a study a drug company was sponsoring at a nearby rehab center testing buprenorphine pills as a quitting aid. \u201cI called on a Thursday and they said they had no openings. I was crushed,\u201d Jernigan said. \u201cThen they called back and said they had a sudden opening on Monday. I was very lucky.\u201d Indeed, most addicts don\u2019t get that opportunity. At the Senate hearing, politicians from both parties voiced outrage over the statistic that only about 1 in 5 prescription painkiller addicts who want help can gain entrance into a recovery program that offers them both medication and counseling, the best proven way to recover from addiction. (Many instead end up in dodgy rehab centers that quickly detox addicts, but don\u2019t offer them medication or counseling to keep them from relapsing.) \u201cI\u2019m incredibly discouraged that we have more folks signing up for addiction treatment in Vermont now than we did when we started,\u201d Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin testified, decrying the FDA\u2019s recent approval of oxycodone for children. \u201cWe simply pass out painkillers like candy in America.\u201d To counteract addictions to prescription painkillers (as well as heroin, their chemical cousin), Shumlin called for allowing nurses and physician assistants to prescribe buprenorphine, something they can readily do now for painkillers. The idea was seconded by senators from both parties. Since its approval in 2002, buprenorphine has become a leading medication for treating opioid addiction. Although it\u2019s a chemical cousin to opioid painkillers and heroin, it provides less euphoria while saturating the brain\u2019s opiate receptors, making it nearly impossible to overdose or get high off of other opiate drugs, like heroin. Most often it is sold as the drug Suboxone (a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone, which blocks the high from other opioids to prevent misuse) in the form of strips that dissolve under the tongue, although it is also sold in generic tablets. Essentially buprenorphine serves as a bridge to stave off the pain of withdrawal. \u201cYou can\u2019t quit when you are feeling sick,\u201d said Jernigan, who started taking buprenorphine two years, five months, and a couple of days ago. He counts each day. Despite its effectiveness, buprenorphine has been slow to catch on: It\u2019s now prescribed about 10 million times a year, typically in a monthlong dose, a fraction of the 200 million\u2013plus prescriptions for opioid painkillers. Partly that\u2019s because the government says that doctors can\u2019t prescribe it to more than 100 patients, and most are limited to 30 or fewer. Even those doctors must take a short course to receive a waiver allowing them to prescribe the drug. Along with many doctors staying away from treating addicts, the restrictions explain why only about 29,000 of the nation\u2019s 916,000 doctors prescribe the drug. In contrast, there are about 320,000 U.S. prescribers of extended-dosage opioid painkillers with unlimited prescribing privileges, according to FDA. Surveys suggest that most of the doctors allowed to prescribe buprenorphine are not psychiatrists or addiction specialists, epidemiologist Hannah Knudsen of the University of Kentucky in Lexington told BuzzFeed News. Their numbers have grown by about 20% in the last two years, however, partly reflecting southern states catching up to northern states in the number of accredited doctors.\n\n\n\nTraditional detoxification, where a patient is nursed through withdrawal and then returns home after about a month, is a lousy way to treat addiction. It leads to relapse about 90% of the time. But buprenorphine is not a miracle alternative. Of the 24 addicts, including Jernigan, who were in the study testing the drug with counseling, only 3 successfully quit, including him. Across many trials, buprenorphine leads to success in only one-quarter to one-third of addicts, according to FDA survey data presented last month at an advisory committee meeting. Plus, people do get high on buprenorphine. \u201cIf you make a drug more available, it will be abused,\u201d R. Terry Furst of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice told BuzzFeed News. His own interviews with addicts and dealers suggest that opioid addicts sometimes use buprenorphine as a way to tide their cravings over, until they next binge on heroin. Furst is also worried about recreational drug users who binge on the weekends \u2014 he calls them \u201cweekend warriors\u201d \u2014 who are finding their way to \u201cbupes.\u201d So he\u2019s not happy about the new moves in Washington to make prescribing buprenorphine easier. Raising the limits on the number of patients who can receive prescriptions or letting nurses prescribe buprenorphine under a doctor\u2019s supervision \u201cis insane,\u201d he said. Not everyone agrees. Addiction specialists such as Gail D\u2019Onofrio of Yale say that restricting buprenorphine prescriptions could hinder full-fledged recovery centers that offer counseling as well as medication. \u201cPeople need help with a job, with mental issues, with their family, with putting their life together again,\u201d D\u2019Onofrio told BuzzFeed News. Those kind of services cost money, and the doctor becomes a bottleneck on the number of addicts that quality recovery centers can treat.\n\nLast month, an FDA scientific advisory committee voted 12 to 5 in favor of a new approach: a six-month implant of buprenorphine for addicts who are \u201cstable\u201d in their recovery from prescription painkiller addiction. Called Probuphine, and developed by Titan Pharmaceuticals of California and Braeburn Pharmaceuticals of New Jersey, the implant buried in a patient\u2019s upper arm will in theory deliver a six-month supply of the medication while limiting illicit sales. \u201cIt sounds like a reasonably good option for someone in recovery to \u2018get it and forget it\u2019 so they don\u2019t have to remember their medication,\u201d addiction treatment expert Marc LaRochelle of Boston Medical Center told BuzzFeed News. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t give it to everyone, but it would be nice to have another option.\u201d The FDA had nixed the implant in 2013, overriding an earlier science panel vote for its approval, out of concern about a lack of safety data. FDA scientists again voiced concerns again at last month\u2019s hearing, which largely debated a Braeburn-funded study finding the implant performed at least as well as the other approved forms of the drug in 176 addicts. Jernigan was one of the study volunteers, and he testified in favor of the implant at the Jan. 12 hearing, his travel paid for by Braeburn. \u201cWhat the implant does is take away the reminder of how I screwed up every day, and the worry about missing my medication,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to go to the pharmacy to get the look, \u2018Oh you are one of those.\u2019\u201d At the same hearing, Braeburn representatives suggested that only 14% of the implant patients relapsed into illicit drug use during the trial, compared with 28% of daily pill users. About 25% of people now prescribed low doses of buprenorphine to treat addiction after about six months of recovery \u2014 or about 400,000 addicts \u2014 could benefit from implants, the company says. But the implant users ended up taking more medication overall than the daily drug users, pharmacologist Tracy Rupp of the National Center for Health Research testified, in a critique. That\u2019s likely because it might take up to four weeks for the implant\u2019s medication to kick in, she said, and the patients required extra medication until that happened. Doctors mishandling the transition from daily doses of buprenorphine to the implant might leave recovering addicts suddenly vulnerable to relapse. Furst also worries about addicts ripping the implants out of their arms to get high. \u201cNever underestimate the ingenuity of someone addicted,\u201d he said. But Braeburn representatives said at the hearing that little of the drug could be recovered from the implant that way. For Jernigan, an implant\u2019s potential to remove him from the stigma of picking up his prescription counts as much as anything in its favor. \u201cEveryone\u2019s recovery is different, but this stuff saved my life,\u201d Jernigan said to BuzzFeed News. \u201cNot having to worry about forgetting it and reminding my wife of the problems I caused all the time would be wonderful.\u201d \u201cI feel sorry for all the people who didn\u2019t make it,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve worked hard, harder than I worked when I was young, the last few years. But it is also fun, clearing my mind finally.

But Dr. Malgorzata Skaznik-Wikiel, an obstetrician-gynecologist who led the study, is encouraged. She worked with a group of mice that are genetically bred to have healthy ratios of omega 3 fatty acids. These mice are born with the ability to bathe cells and tissues in omega 3 fats, so the team then looked at their egg development in the ovaries.\n\nWhat she found: The mice with the higher levels of omega 3 fatty acids seemed to have more precursors to egg cells than control mice with lower levels of the fat, meaning they had a larger reserve of eggs-to-be. These could then mature into a healthy egg that is fertilized and can lead to a live birth. When the ovaries were examined even further, Skaznik-Wikiel also found that the quality of the eggs were better among the animals with higher levels of omega 3s. Higher quality eggs improves the chances that the egg will be fertilized and develop into a live pup.\n\n\u201cBased on this study, it looks very encouraging that omega 3s can potentially improve fertility,\u201d says Skaznik-Wikiel. \u201cOur study shows that there may be some relationship between dietary factors and things like egg quality so one idea may be recommending supplementation with omega 3s to improve fertility.\u201d\n\nExactly how the healthy omega 3 fatty acids are helping the ovary to produce better quality eggs isn\u2019t clear yet. But other studies Skaznik-Wikiel has done with mice suggests that these fats may lower levels of inflammation that can adversely affect ovarian function.\n\nMore studies need to replicate and confirm the role that omega 3 fatty acids might play in fertility, but for now, Skaznik-Wikiel says that there isn\u2019t much harm in consuming more omega 3 fats.

They found that the two groups had widespread differences in terms of brain connectivity.\n\nEEG revealed that the children with autism had a reduced short range connectivity, indicating poor function of local brain networks. This was especially true in the left hemisphere regions of the brain responsible for language.\n\nThe children with autism also had increased connectivity between brain regions that were farther apart, which might be a mechanism developed to compensate for reduced short range connectivity, the researchers said.\n\nThe research was conducted at Boston Children's Hospital and was published online June 25 in the journal BMC Medicine.\n\nThe use of EEG-based testing may help diagnose autism in children and may improve early detection in infants, leading to more effective treatments and coping strategies, the researchers said.\n\n\"What was unique about this study is the very large number of children studied,\" Dawson noted. \"Consistent with many previous studies using EEG and functional MRI with both children and adults with autism, these investigators found that, overall, children with autism show reduced coordination (coherence) across brain regions.\"\n\nShe said the findings are important because, \"they help us understand why individuals with autism have difficulty with complex behaviors, such as social interaction and language. As children's brains develop, the different brain regions become increasingly connected, allowing for the acquisition of complex behaviors that require coordination across different brain regions.\"\n\nLanguage, for example, requires coordination across the auditory, visual, and motor brain regions, as well as the participation of the prefrontal cortex, she said.\n\n\"This reduced functional connectivity in the brain helps us understand impairments associated with autism,\" she added. \"The hope is that early behavioral intervention can help mitigate these functional impairments, helping to form the connections that natural develop in typical children.\"\n\n\"Although autism is still principally a clinical diagnosis, this study ... may allow for a new approach to classifying children with autism and may even assist in the early identification of affected children at a younger age,\" said Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven & Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York in New Hyde Park, NY.\n\nThe number of children diagnosed with autism in the United States has recently increased to one in 88.\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more about autism.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "It is not clear from this story that EEGs are widely used in research or whether they currently have other clinical applications.

And a new clinical trial suggests they are not just blowing smoke.\n\nThe study, published Monday, found that for 30 MS patients with muscle \u201cspasticity,\u201d a few days of marijuana smoking brought some relief.\n\nBut the big caveat, researchers say, is that it\u2019s not clear that the downsides of pot smoking are worth it.\n\nSome people with MS are already using medical marijuana to treat certain symptoms, including spasticity \u2014 when the muscles in the legs or arms contract painfully, in something akin to a \u201ccharley horse.\u201d\n\nThere is some science behind the idea: The body naturally produces cannabinoids, the group of chemicals found in marijuana. And studies have suggested the cannabinoid receptors on our cells help regulate muscle spasticity.\n\nBut the evidence that pot smoking actually helps with spasticity has been anecdotal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard from patients that marijuana helps their spasticity, but I think a lot us thought, \u2018Well, it\u2019s probably just making you feel good,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Jody Corey-Bloom, the lead researcher on the new study.\n\n\u201cI think this study shows that yes, (marijuana) may help with spasticity, but at a cost,\u201d said Corey-Bloom, of the University of California, San Diego.\n\nThe cost, her team found, is that smoking caused fatigue and dizziness in some users, and generally slowed down people\u2019s mental skills soon after they used marijuana.\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear if that would have any long-term consequences, Corey-Bloom said.\n\nAbout 400,000 people in the United States have MS, a chronic disease in which the protective coating around nerve fibers starts breaking down.\n\nThe new study, reported in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, included 30 MS patients with muscle spasticity that had failed to get better with standard medication.\n\nCorey-Bloom\u2019s team had each patient smoke marijuana or \u201cplacebo\u201d joints \u2014 which looked, smelled and tasted like the real thing, but lacked the active ingredient in marijuana, known as THC.\n\nEach patient smoked marijuana once a day for three days and used the placebo cigarette once a day on three separate days. Before and after each treatment, an independent rater assessed the patients\u2019 muscle spasticity.\n\nOverall, the study found, measures of spasticity dropped an average of three points \u2014about 30 percent \u2014 on a 24-point scale when patients smoked marijuana, but didn\u2019t change after they smoked the placebo.\n\nThe issue of treating spasticity is \u201ccertainly an important one,\u201d said Nicholas LaRocca, vice president of healthcare delivery and policy research at the National MS Society.\n\n\u201cSpasticity is a big problem for many people with MS, and the current medications don\u2019t necessarily work for everyone,\u201d said LaRocca, who was not involved in the new study.\n\n\u201cBut smoking marijuana does not appear to be a long-term solution, because of the cognitive effects,\u201d he told Reuters Health.\n\nPeople with MS are already at some risk of \u201ccognitive changes,\u201d LaRocca pointed out, so the potential for lasting effects from long-term marijuana smoking is a concern.\n\nHowever, LaRocca said, researchers are developing cannabinoid-based medications for MS. That includes a cannabinoid mouth spray called Sativex that has been approved in the UK, Canada, Spain and New Zealand to treat MS-related spasticity.\n\nResearch into cannabinoids and spasticity should continue, LaRocca said, because medications may be able to harness the benefits of specific cannabis compounds, without the side effects linked to smoking pot.\n\nBoth LaRocca and Corey-Bloom said there were limitations to the current study.\n\n\u201cBlinding\u201d people as to whether they are on marijuana or a placebo is tough since the drug creates a \u201chigh\u201d feeling.\n\nIn this study, 17 of 30 patients were able to correctly guess whether they were using marijuana or a placebo at each of their six visits with the researchers.

Compared to other mice, those fed agave fructans absorbed more calcium from food, excreted less calcium in their feces, and had a 50 percent increase in levels of a protein associated with the build-up of new bone tissue.\n\n\"These results suggest that the supplementation of the standard diet with agave fructans prevented bone loss and improved bone formation, indicating the important role of agave fructans on the maintenance of healthy bone,\" Lopez said. \"They can be used in many products for children and infants to help prevent various diseases, and can even be used in ice cream as a sugar substitute.\"\n\nBut drinking tequila won't help, the study authors noted.

H. Chan School of Public Health, and her colleagues decided to study how diet during adolescence might affect cancer risk. In a study reported in the , they plumbed the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, a massive survey of nurses who filled out questionnaires on their diet and were followed for various health outcomes, including cancer.\n\nAbout half of the 90,000 women who participated in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study also answered questions about their typical diet while they were teens. Those who reported eating nearly three servings of fruit a day on average had a 25% lower risk of developing breast cancer than those who ate half a serving of fruit.\n\nMORE: With Early Breast Cancer Treatment, Less May be More: Studies\n\nCertain fruits seemed to confer the biggest protection against breast cancer \u2014 apples, bananas and grapes were associated with the greatest reduction in risk while kale and oranges in adulthood also contributed to reduced breast cancer risk.\n\nFarvid says that apples, bananas and grapes contain fiber, which could help to lower cancer risk; they are also high in flavonoids, which act as antioxidants to combat damage to cells that can trigger abnormal growth.

In the study, Farvid and her team could not find any significant relationship between fruit juice and breast cancer risk; that may be because fruit\u2019s anti-cancer effects may have to do with the fiber found in the whole fruit, which is stripped out of juice. In the latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans, however, government nutritionists equated servings of whole fruit with fruit juice. \u201cWe recommend whole fruit and not fruit juice,\u201d says Farvid, \u201cbecause maybe one of the most important ways that fruit decreases risk of breast cancer is through fiber, and even natural fruit juice often has no fiber in it.\u201d\n\nIn another study also published in the , a separate group of researchers found that among 22,000 Danish women, those who added two alcoholic drinks a day on average increased their risk of developing breast cancer by 30% over five years.

But doctors say they should: these veins are not just a cosmetic problem, but can also lead to aches, pain, and heaviness from blood pooling in the legs.\n\nThe treatment known as sclerotherapy \u2014 an alternative to surgery \u2014 entails injecting a solution to irritate and collapse vein walls, so the vein eventually disappears. A series of sessions is usually required for a large area.\n\nVein specialists across the country often inject one of two drugs. One, sodium tetradecyl sulfate, or STS, has long been F.D.A. approved. The other, polidocanol, had not been legal, although some doctors used it, importing it from abroad or obtaining it from pharmacies that make drug compounds. \u201cYou have some legal exposure by doing so,\u201d said Dr. Morrison, a vein specialist in greater .\n\nThat said, polidocanol was the \u201csecond most commonly used sclerosing agent\u201d because, he said, \u201cmost physicians want to give their patients the best available treatment.\u201d\n\nF.D.A. approval of polidocanol should benefit patients several ways.

By contrast, he said by e-mail, Asclera \u201cis very safe for skin.\u201d\n\nAn injector\u2019s experience matters, because if the injection misses the vein, (or open sores) can occur. In these rare, worst-case scenarios, Asclera is relatively forgiving and less likely to lead to ulceration.\n\nVein specialists must first figure out which patients would benefit from sclerotherapy alone, and which need inner varicose veins treated before injections. Using to map inner veins as well as visible ones is crucial for patients who complain of enlarged veins and symptoms like achy pain. \u201cThe underlying veins have to be addressed before you can even think of addressing the visible bulging veins,\u201d said Dr. Robert J. Min, radiologist in chief at . \u201cOtherwise they\u2019ll just come back.\u201d\n\nToday, sluggish underlying veins are best addressed with radio-frequency or laser treatment, said Dr. Min, who developed such a laser.

She is still due for treatments, so some veins remain visible, but they are no longer raised. She now wears sundresses instead of just selling them in her boardwalk shop.\n\nSome vein specialists use liquid irritants like STS or polidocanol to make an injectable foam that targets larger varicose veins. Why? A \u201csudsy foam will fill up the vein, come into full contact with the lining of the vein wall, whereas liquid works for very small veins only,\u201d said Dr. Nisha Bunke, a vein specialist. She said veins as large as a Sharpie marker can be tackled with foam sclerotherapy. But the F.D.A. considers a foam version of STS or polidocanol to be a different product from the liquid. So injecting it is an off-label use.\n\nDr. Min said in an e-mail message that foam sclerotherapy was \u201cvery safe,\u201d but that \u201cit is associated with higher risks than liquid sclerotherapy.\u201d Foam injections have been blamed as the cause of blood clots in leg veins, he wrote, adding that one known stroke \u201cmay have been caused by foam sclerotherapy.\u201d\n\nBut foam sclerotherapy has been a big relief for some patients.

In a study published this week in mBio\u00ae, an open-access journal of the American Society for Microbiology, the team shows that a live, attenuated version of the Zika virus could form the basis of a new treatment option for this fatal brain cancer.\n\nGlioblastoma kills about 15,000 adults in the US each year and is currently incurable because patients experience a high recurrence rate of their cancer even after the standard treatments of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Scientists suspect this recurrence is due to cancer stem cells, called glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), which hide out in nearby brain tissue even after the combination of therapies.\n\n\"During the Zika epidemic, we learned that the virus preferentially infects neural progenitor cells in the fetus, and causes the devastating microcephaly seen in babies born to infected mothers,\" says Pei-Yong Shi, a virologist at University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. He co-led the current study with tumor biologist Jianghong Man of the National Center of Biomedical Analysis in Beijing and virologist Cheng-Feng Qin of the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Beijing.\n\n\"We made the connection that perhaps Zika virus could also specifically infect the GSCs,\" because these cells have similar properties to neural stem cells, says Man. In previous work, Shi and his collaborators at Washington University in St. Louis showed that Zika virus did indeed attack and kill GSCs grown in the lab dish and in a mouse model of glioblastoma. In addition, the Zika virus was much less efficient at attacking the differentiated, healthy brain cells. (image: transmission electron micrograph of Zika virus, NIAID)\n\n\"If we could find a way to specifically target those GSCs that are the source of recurrence, then that might provide an option to prevent recurrence or even a cure,\" says Qin.\n\nThe team's first objective was to determine if there was a safe way to use Zika virus in patients to attack the cancer cells. Shi's lab has developed a promising live-attenuated Zika vaccine candidate called ZIKV-LAV that had been shown to be safe, non-virulent, and effective in protecting against infection in mice and non-human primates. The ZIKV-LAV has a small deletion from the viral genome that prevents it from replicating itself efficiently.\n\nWhen the team injected this ZIKV-LAV into the brains of mice, they saw no health effects on the mice, no weight loss, and no behavioral abnormalities such as loss of appetite, depression, lethargy, or self-injury. The mice also functioned normally in tests for anxiety and motor function.\n\nNext, the team wanted to show whether the ZIKA-LAV could work to infect and kill human patient-derived GSCs in a mouse model. So they mixed GSCs from two different human patient donors with the ZIKA-LAV and injected the mixture into the brains of mice. Mice that got the injection of the GSCs only rapidly developed tumors. Mice that got the ZIKV-LAV injected as well saw a significant delay in tumor development. Co-implanting the virus along with the GSCs also prolonged the median survival time of the treated mice to around 50 days, compared to around 30 days for the untreated mice who received GSCs alone.\n\nQin says that perhaps in the future patients would be given the Zika vaccine at the same time as surgery to \"let the viruses hunt down the GSCs and eliminate them.\"\n\nFinally, the team investigated the cellular mechanisms that the modified Zika virus used to kill the GSCs. They took GSCs treated with the ZIKV-LAV and those GSCs not treated and sequenced all the RNA messages being expressed in these two cell populations. Comparing those profiles, the team found that in the treated cells, the virus triggered a strong antiviral response in the cells, which induced inflammation and eventually cell death.\n\nNext, the team will work with clinicians to develop safety tests of the ZIKV-LAV in glioblastoma patients. They may also modify the Zika virus further to make it an even more potent cancer cell killing machine. For example, Man explains, the researchers could add an immune modulator as a 'cargo' in the viral genome. Then, once such a virus infects a cancer cell and kills it, the immune modulator would be released to alert and activate the patient's systemic immune system against the remaining cancer cells.\n\n\"As a virologist, I see that we should take advantage of the 'bad' side of viruses,\" says Shi. \"They should have a role to play in cancer treatment.\"\n\nThe American Society for Microbiology is the largest single life science society, composed of more than 30,000 scientists and health professionals.

According to a network meta-analysis research article published in the May 1, 2018 issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (JAAOS), the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) naproxen was ranked most effective in individual knee OA treatment for improving both pain and function, and is considered a relatively safe and low-cost treatment method.\n\nNonsurgical treatments for knee OA supported by previous research evidence include strength training, low-impact aerobic exercises, NSAIDs, and weight loss in individuals with a body mass index over 25. This new research analyzed data from multiple trials to determine the relative effectiveness of various nonsurgical treatments for knee OA. The treatments that were compared and ranked included acetaminophen; ibuprofen; intra-articular (IA) or joint injections of cortisone; platelet-rich plasma (PRP); hyaluronic acid (HA); several NSAIDs, such as naproxen, celecoxib, and diclofenac; and both oral and IA placebo.\n\n\"This is the first comprehensive mixed-comparison analysis comparing best-evidence scientific research and excluding lower quality studies that can bias the outcomes,\" said lead author and orthopaedic surgeon David Jevsevar, MD, MBA. \"Using a statistical ranking technique, we worked to provide evidence regarding which of the most common NSAIDs are most likely to decrease pain and improve function, and we attempted to fill in the gaps in evidence for more inconclusive treatments such as HA, PRP, and corticosteroids.\"\n\nAuthors analyzed 53 randomized controlled trials that examined knee OA treatments for at least 28 days and included a minimum of 30 participants per study group. Knee OA treatments were ranked on a scale of one to five, with one being the most effective. They found the following:\n\u2022 For pain reduction, cortisone injections provided the greatest short-term (4 to 6 weeks) pain relief, followed by ibuprofen, PRP injections, naproxen, and celecoxib.\n\u2022 Naproxen ranked the highest for probability for improving function, followed by diclofenac, celecoxib, ibuprofen, and PRP injections.\n\u2022 Naproxen was ranked the most effective individual knee OA treatment for improving both pain and function followed by cortisone injections, PRP injections, ibuprofen and celecoxib.\n\u2022 HA injections did not achieve a rank in the top five treatments for pain, function, or combined pain and function. An analysis of 12 articles also found that results with HA are not significantly different from those with IA placebo for treatment of knee OA.\n\n\"Because knee OA has both a high disease burden and high treatment costs, additional prospective studies using similar outcomes, timelines, and measures of clinically important changes are needed,\" explained Dr. Jevsevar. \"While the information in this analysis is helpful to physicians, patients also can benefit from these findings and use it with their doctors to weigh all possible treatment options.\"\n\nAlthough the use of NSAIDs for arthritic conditions such as knee OA has potential risks, including heart attack and stroke, existing evidence indicates that naproxen has less potential for adverse cardiovascular events.\n\nMore information about the AAOS and JAAOS\n\nFollow the AAOS on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram \n\nFollow the conversation about JAAOS on Twitter\n\nFrom the Department of Orthopaedics, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH (Dr. Jevsevar), American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, Rosemont, IL (Mr. Shores, Mr. Mullen, Ms. Schulte, and Dr. Cummins), and Franciscan Orthopedic Associates, Tacoma, WA (Dr. Brown).

Both acupuncture and Alexander Technique prove effective for long-term relief of chronic neck pain\n\nIn a randomized, controlled trial, both acupuncture and the Alexander Technique led to long-term significant reductions in neck pain and associated disability compared with usual care alone. The study is published in Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nChronic neck pain is a leading cause of disability. Usual care for neck pain generally consists of prescribed medications and visits to physical therapists and other health care professionals. In addition, persons with chronic neck pain often seek complimentary care to manage their condition, such as acupuncture or the Alexander Technique. Acupuncture is a procedure in which patients have thin needles inserted into specific points on the body to relieve pain and the Alexander Technique is an educational process that teaches people how to avoid unnecessary muscular and mental tension in everyday activities.\n\nResearchers sought to determine the clinical effectiveness of acupuncture or Alexander Technique lessons compared with usual care for persons with chronic, nonspecific neck pain. Patients were randomly assigned to 12 acupuncture sessions or 20 one-to-one Alexander Technique lessons plus usual care, or usual care only. Neck pain was assessed by the Northwick Park Questionnaire (NPQ) at 3, 6, and 12 months.\n\nThe researchers found that acupuncture and the Alexander Technique lessons both led to a significant reduction in neck pain at 12 months compared with usual care alone. Both interventions had a high rate of acceptability, and greater adherence was associated with better pain outcomes. Over time, both interventions resulted in a greater increase in self-efficacy than did usual care, and these improvements were associated with better NPQ outcomes.\n\nNote: For an embargoed PDF, please contact Cara Graeff.

Half of the group was assigned to naltrexone and the other half to bupenorphine.\n\nSix percent of those enlisted to use buprenorphine were unable to start their treatment, whereas 28% of those assigned to naltrexone dropped out before starting the therapy.\n\nThat hurdle is attributed to the fact that in order to start naltrexone, a person has to have detoxed or not used opioids for several days, whereas a user can transition from opioids to buprenorphine seamlessly. \"If you're currently opiate-dependent ... (naltrexone) takes more work,\" said Dr. Joshua Lee , the lead author of the study, who studies opioid addiction behavior and treatment at New York University.\n\nOnce on either of the medications, people fared equally well. \"They tend to stay on medications about the same rate. They report good outcomes, avoiding heroin use,\" Lee said. However, both groups also reported similar challenges staying with the regimens: Just 40% of patients still used the drugs after 24 weeks.\n\nWhat was important, Lee said, was for opioid addicts as well as treatment providers to understand that addiction isn't one-size-fits-all. \"Much like you would expect if the doctor told you 'you have cancer' or 'you have diabetes,' then there are different ways you could pursue treatment,\" he said.\n\nPublic health experts consider medicated-assisted treatment the gold standard of opioid addiction treatment. It combines medication with counseling to help addicts wean off of high opioid use. Public health experts say it can help solve the staggering opioid overdose epidemic.\n\nMethadone may be the best-known form of medicated-assisted treatment, but it requires patients to have the drug administered daily in a clinic. Two other options have become increasingly popular: buprenorphine, which can be taken outside a clinic, and naltrexone, which is administered monthly.\n\nLegally prescribed opioid drugs like oxycodone and hydrocodone work in the same manner as illicit drugs like heroin. They all chemically bind to the opioid receptors in the brain to help dull pain and, in some people, provide euphoria.\n\nThe body also produces natural opioids, but the more narcotics a person takes, the less opioids the body naturally produces. Without the opioids, people can go into withdrawal, all contributing to a cycle of dependency.\n\n\"To feel normal, they need opiates on those receptors,\" Banta-Green said. Buprenorphine and methadone, which are opioids, work by reducing people's cravings. \"They bind to prevent withdrawal, giving some opiate effect,\" he said.\n\nOn the other hand, naltrexone works by chemically blocking those receptors, which is why someone needs to detox before starting the regimen. \"You're not getting an opiate effect,\" Banta-Green explained.\n\nIf a person takes an opioid while on naltrexone, it is unlikely they will feel any opioid sensation. If a person is using opioids and takes naltrexone, it can induce a feeling of withdrawal. \"It addresses craving in a different way. The person knows they can't use,\" he said.\n\nSo, for example, a person who is actively using opioids and can't manage the withdrawals may be better suited for buprenorphine, while someone coming from a facility where he or she has detoxed and who doesn't want to use opioids may be better suited for naltrexone.\n\nWhat is key, said Dr. Miriam Komaromy, is meeting a patient where they are and understanding what best meets their needs.\n\nAddiction \"is an incredibly deadly disease,\" said Komaromy, an addiction specialist at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center. And as public policymakers, prisons and drug courts play a larger role in treating addiction, public health experts like Komaromy argue that it is imperative to look at \"evidence-based ways instead of having a moralistic view.\"\n\nBanta-Green says he talks to a lot of judges who are trying to understand addiction treatment. \"I say this a lot to judges: You can't just offer one medication. Just like any other medication, some people are going to feel right with one as opposed to the other.\"", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "All three drugs mentioned in the story are available, though more could have been said about how accessible they are to people who are trying to overcome addiction.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "PHILADELPHIA - According to a new study, women experiencing difficulty with time management, attention, organization, memory, and problem solving - often referred to as executive functions - related to menopause may find improvement with a drug already being used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The study led by researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania is the first to show that lisdexamfetamine (LDX) improved subjective and objective measures of cognitive decline commonly experienced in menopausal women. Results of the study are published online today in the journal Psychopharmacology.\n\n\"Reports of cognitive decline, particularly in executive functions, are widespread among menopausal women,\" said lead author, C. Neill Epperson, MD, professor of Psychiatry and Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and director of the Penn Center for Women's Behavioral Wellness. \"There are approximately 90 million post-menopausal women living in the US alone, and with the average age of onset occurring at 52, the great majority of those women will live in the postmenopausal state for at least one-third of their lives. Therefore, promoting healthy cognitive aging among menopausal women should be a major public health goal.\"\n\nThe Penn-led team administered a once-daily dose of LDX for four weeks to 32 healthy, non-ADHD-diagnosed women between the ages of 45 and 60 experiencing difficulties with executive functions as a result of mid-life onset menopause, and as measured using the Brown Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (BADDS). All participants served as their own controls by being randomly assigned to cross-over to a placebo for an additional four weeks.\n\nThe researchers found a 41 percent overall improvement in executive functions for women receiving LDX, compared to a 17 percent improvement when taking placebo medication. There were also significant improvements in four out of the five subscales for women taking LDX: organization and motivation for work; attention and concentration; alertness, effort, and processing speed; and working memory and accessing recall.\n\nWhile psychostimulants such as LDX are primarily marketed for the treatment of ADHD, they have been successful in treating cognitive complaints in some patients including postmenopausal women. They work by promoting the release of dopamine, which is impaired in ADHD and other disorders characterized by executive function problems.\n\n\"Although we observed that short-term use of LDX was well tolerated and effective in several subjective and objective areas, long-term studies of menopausal women receiving LDX are needed, similar to those conducted for ADHD patients,\" said Epperson. \"It is also important for clinicians to confirm that a woman's complaints of worsening memory are in the executive function domains, are temporally related to the transition to menopause, and are not indicative of some other pathological cognitive impairment before prescribing a trial of LDX.\"\n\nIn addition to Epperson, other Penn co-authors are Sheila Shanmugan, Deborah R.

However, the present results provide sufficient information to suggest that vaping does not increase infection rates and may in fact lead to a decrease in infections.\"\n\nSome previous cell and animal studies have been interpreted as suggesting that vaping may increase vulnerability to infection, but these studies did not use realistic exposure levels. Human trials have reported no significant adverse respiratory effects associated with e-cigarette use for up to 1.5 years and a follow-up study of smokers with asthma who switched to vaping found significant improvements.\n\nThe researchers say that it is not surprising that the survey respondents noticed improvements in their respiratory health. This is because smoking increases susceptibility to respiratory infections and stopping smoking can be expected to have a positive effect. In addition to this, vaping may also provide some antimicrobial protection through the e-liquid ingredient propylene glycol, though further evidence is needed to confirm this.\n\nThe main limitation of the study is that the reports are subjective. Future studies should assess respiratory symptoms objectively and on unselected samples of vapers.

Most of those trials were funded and run by the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture Prozac and Effexor \u2014 Eli Lilly and Wyeth, respectively.\n\nThey included 12 studies of Prozac in adults and four each in elderly patients and youth, as well as 21 trials of immediate- or extended-release Effexor in adults.

You're missing out on a lot of stuff other children can have. I always want to try peanut stuff.\"\n\nMom Monica Glover said the family discovered Ellis' peanut allergy when she was about 3. The tipoff: a skin reaction around her mouth after she was given food with a small amount of peanuts in it. \"We were lucky to have discovered it that way. That was a mild reaction,\" Glover said, and a doctor confirmed the allergy through tests.\n\nThe discovery was \"distressing,\" Glover said. Accidental exposure to peanuts has happened, resulting in \"severe stomach cramps and vomiting,\" she said. \"Essentially, we have to live in fear all the time of Ellis being inadvertently exposed to peanuts and having a reaction that is potentially life-threatening.\"\n\nGlover seized the opportunity to participate in a study on the safety and effectiveness of an experimental treatment that could give her daughter protection against accidental exposure to peanuts. Despite the risk, it was \"a gift,\" she said, adding that her family hoped their efforts might help \"lots of other children.\"\n\nThe risk paid off: Two-thirds of the kids in the study were able to eat the equivalent of two peanuts without any symptoms after following the months-long experimental treatment regimen, the researchers found.\n\nEllis is one of the majority of children for whom the treatment works. \"It's been a huge success,\" her mother said.\n\n\"It does not make the allergy to go away,\" Vickery said. \"The purpose is not to get them to be no longer peanut allergic and allow them to eat whatever they want.\"\n\n\"I'm telling patients when I see them that my hope is that patients will have access by late next summer, something like that,\" Vickery said. He added that although the study proved the treatment's effectiveness and safety only in children, adults would probably benefit in the same way.\n\nTo test the experimental therapy, 66 research centers in 10 countries recruited 551 participants who ranged in age from 4 to 55 and who all had a peanut allergy. Most -- 499 participants -- were between the ages of 4 and 17.\n\n\"We were extremely well-informed about the entire process,\" Glover said. \"You start at a super low dose and work your way up. You take it at the hospital under observation. Then, you take it at home every day. \"\n\nThree-quarters of the study participants were given the treatment in increasing amounts every two weeks until reaching maintenance, when they received the equivalent of one peanut daily. The remainder of the participants were given a placebo. At the conclusion of the study after a year, all of the participants faced an \"exit food challenge\": They ate, under a doctor's supervision, the equivalent of two peanuts.\n\nTwo-thirds of the treatment participants were able to tolerate this exit dose without a severe reaction. Half tolerated even twice that amount: a four-peanut dose.\n\nOverall, participants experienced fewer side effects during the study than the researchers had anticipated. \"It's intuitive that that process would trigger some allergic symptoms in many patients,\" Vickery said. A third completed the study with no more than mild side effects, such as stomachache.\n\nEllis experienced stomach cramps and vomiting multiple times during the study, usually on days when her dose was increased to raise her tolerance. \"Having stomach cramps did not feel very good,\" she said. Still, she usually vomited, and the cramps passed quickly.\n\nOnce, she felt her throat constrict, and \"it was harder for me to breathe,\" she said. She'd gone into anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction. The hospital staff reacted immediately and gave her a shot of epinephrine. \"I felt safe with all the doctors and nurses around me. They can help you get through it,\" she said.\n\nA little more than 11% of the children dropped out of the study due to severe side effects. Among children receiving the treatment, 10% required rescue epinephrine during the exit challenge, compared with 53% in the placebo group.\n\n\"These treatments really have the potential to transform people's lives,\" Vickery said, \"and I have seen it happen firsthand: the sense of relief [families] get when a child becomes desensitized.\"\n\nTrying to be 'bite safe'\n\n\"It's what a lot of families call trying to be 'bite safe.' it's not that you're curing the allergy; it's not that you're going to be able to eat peanut butter sandwiches,\" said Sicherer, who was not involved in the study. \"It's really just to have a better threshold so that if you accidentally ate something that had a little bit of peanut in it, maybe you wouldn't have a reaction or the reaction wouldn't be so bad.\"\n\nThough the immunotherapy treatment is simply a matter of gradually increasing your tolerance to peanuts, you could have a severe reaction at home. \"This is not something to try at home,\" Sicherer said.\n\nAimmune has made peanut into a \"pharmaceutical-grade\" product, he said. \"Most people think of it as medicinalized food.\" Doctors and patients both know exactly how much you're getting, he said, \"and that's important because if you're reactive to, say, a 50th of a peanut, you don't want to have a mistake where you're suddenly getting a 10th of peanut.\"\n\nAssuming the treatment wins FDA approval, Sicherer said, the conversation between doctors and patients will be, \"Is it better to just avoid the food and ask a lot of questions at restaurants and be real careful, or do something like this and still don't eat the food and ask the questions in the restaurant, but at least know you have a bit of a safety valve?\"\n\nThere are more than a few caveats when it comes to the treatment regimen. For one, it's \"a commitment,\" he said. You cannot take a dose before exercising, and you can't skip doses, or you might have a severe reaction when you pick it up again.\n\nGlover noted, \"It's somewhat disruptive. You have to do it every day. Generally, we would take it after dinner.\" After giving the medicine, she added, parents must carefully monitor their children, preventing them from becoming too active or too hot.\n\nSicherer said, \"The family that does this really, really, really has to be a rule follower. It's not easy.\" It would still be worth it to many, he said.\n\nIf this ends up being the first approved treatment, if it is covered by insurance and if details of whom it works for best were all worked out and the risks and benefits were clear, \"that would be so amazing, because we haven't really had anything like that before,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not everything we would hope for, but it's still fantastic to be able to raise someone's threshold from a teeny tiny amount of peanut to a couple of peanuts or more,\" said Sicherer, who believes that other allergy products will be developed in time: \"I can tell my patients that this might be the right thing for them, but if not, we're looking at things that might be easier and better down the road.\"\n\nGlover acknowledges that \"it's not a perfect solution. I would say it's been some work to go through this study, just in terms of a time commitment.\" Still, if it had taken twice the amount of time, she would have done it: \"It's peace of mind.\"\n\nEven though she dislikes the medicine's taste, Ellis also believes it is worth it. \"It's definitely better,\" she would say to another kid with peanut allergy: \"You know you can be around your friends when they have peanut butter on them.\"", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story makes clear that the treatment is not yet FDA-approved, and is not currently commercially available.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "April 29, 2016 - A modified surgical technique may provide a simpler approach to the surgical treatment for one type of chronic headache, according to an \"Ideas and Innovations\" paper in the May issue of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery\u00ae, the official medical journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS).\n\nUsing an incision originally designed for another purpose, surgeons can gain direct access to the nerves involved in some types of chronic temporal headache, according to the report by ASPS Member Surgeon Dr. Ziv M. Peled of Peled Plastic Surgery, San Francisco. He hopes his new technique will \"lower the bar to adoption\" of effective surgical treatment for patients with this debilitating headache condition.\n\nIn recent years, surgery has emerged as an effective treatment option for selected patients with chronic, severe headaches. Developed by plastic surgeons who noticed that some migraine patients had fewer headaches after cosmetic forehead-lift, these procedures address \"trigger sites\" linked to certain headache patterns.\n\nSevere temporal headaches can result from muscle spasms or enlarged blood vessels putting pressure on specific nerves located on the side of the head--specifically, the zygomaticotemporal branch of the trigeminal nerve (ZTBTN) and sometimes the auriculotemporal nerve (ATN). During these operative procedures, surgeons seek to relieve pressure on these nerves or to disconnect the nerves in order to prevent them from triggering future headaches.\n\nThe technique is a new use of an approach that many surgeons are already familiar with: the Gillies incision, used for surgical repair of cheekbone fractures. Dr. Peled found that this short incision, placed in the temple behind the hairline, provides direct access to the ZTBTN and ATN. He describes his initial experience with the new approach in 19 patients.\n\nAll patients had chronic temporal headaches that did not improve with medications. They also had a positive result on preoperative testing--either injection of botulinum toxin (Botox) to temporarily block muscle activity, or local anesthetics to temporarily block the involved nerve. Before and after surgery, headache symptoms were assessed using a standard score, the Migraine Headache Index (MHI).\n\nAs in previous studies, surgery provided significant relief from chronic temporal headaches. Average MHI score decreased from about 132 points before surgery to 52 points afterward. Of the 19 patients, 16 had at least a 50 percent reduction in headache symptoms.\n\nIt's unclear why the three remaining patients didn't have good improvement, although Dr. Peled notes that two of the three had had temporal headaches for decades before surgery. None of the patients experienced complications, and there was little or no visible scarring.\n\nThe experience supports a growing body of research showing good outcomes with surgery for chronic temporal headaches. Most recently, a study in Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery reported similar results whether the nerve is decompressed or disconnected. However, previous studies have used technically more complex approaches to access the ZTBTN.\n\nThe simplified approach using the Gillies incision combines the advantages of other approaches to chronic temporal headache surgery while minimizing the disadvantages, Dr. Peled believes.

And experts warn people to consult their doctor before taking the medication, which increases the risk of bleeding ulcers.\n\n\u201cI like to say you have to make the recommendation about aspirin one patient at a time,\u201d Dr. Michael L. LeFevre, who was not linked to the study, told Reuters Health.\n\nLeFevre worked on the 2009 aspirin recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), a federally supported expert panel.\n\nThe task force advises that men age 45 to 79 take aspirin to stave off heart attacks, as long as the benefit outweighs the risk of bleeding. For women age 55 to 79, aspirin is recommended to prevent strokes, with the same caveat.\n\nThe new work, by Alfred Bartolucci of the University of Alabama at Birmingham and colleagues, was supported by aspirin-maker Bayer AG.\n\nThe research team pooled the results of the nine trials that have tested the drug in the prevention of heart disease so far, including three that weren\u2019t part of the 2009 USPSTF review.\n\nAbout 100,000 men and women age 45 and up took part in the studies. Some were healthy and some had diabetes, but none had chest pain or other symptoms of an ailing heart.\n\nThe researchers found a 19-percent reduction in non-fatal heart attacks among participants who took aspirin compared to those who did not.\n\nThey don\u2019t mention how many people actually suffered such a heart attack, but an earlier analysis of six of the trials showed that out of every 1,000 people, 18 individuals taking aspirin had heart attacks every year, compared to 23 individuals taking placebo pills.\n\nOn the other hand, that analysis also found aspirin increased the rate of bleeding from 0.7 to 1 per 1,000 people per year, making the authors conclude the drug was of \u201cuncertain net value.\u201d\n\nHeart disease is the leading killer worldwide and accounts for more than a third of deaths in the U.S., according to the American Heart Association. Every year, heart attacks alone kill some 400,000 Americans.\n\nIn the current study, published in the American Journal of Cardiology, the researchers also report small decreases in stroke and death risks with aspirin, although those changes might have been due to chance.\n\n\u201cIt refines our knowledge of how beneficial aspirin is,\u201d Dr. Graham Nichol, an expert in emergency care at the University of Washington in Seattle, said about the study. \u201cI don\u2019t think this paper is inconsistent with previous work.\u201d\n\nNichols, who was not involved in the study, said aspirin is clearly beneficial for people who\u2019ve already had heart disease, and that it also seems to help those at high risk.\n\n\u201cThere is not universal agreement on what is high risk,\u201d he told Reuters Health. \u201cIn my mind, if you have diabetes or multiple risk factors for heart disease \u2014 such as smoking or obesity \u2014 it is reasonable to take aspirin.\u201d\n\nIn addition, working to eliminate those risk factors by other means will not only slash the risk of heart disease, but also a host of other health problems.\n\nLeFevre added that while the new study did add extra evidence compared with earlier work, it failed to analyze the effects on men and women separately.\n\nThat muddies the picture because men may see a benefit in the form of fewer heart attacks, whereas aspirin appears to lower the risk of stroke in women.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t tell from the existing study if that is going to hold up or not,\u201d he said.\n\nOne recent study has suggested that despite the increase in bleeding ulcers from aspirin, the reduction in heart attacks might make the cheap drug cost-effective for men over 45.\n\nThe question then becomes finding out what your risk of heart attack is in the first place, which your doctor can help with.\n\n\u201cThe number of events that you prevent depends on your baseline risk,\u201d LeFevre concluded. \u201cA blanket recommendation that everybody should take an aspirin is not a good idea.\u201d", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Not applicable.\u00a0 The availability of aspirin is not in question.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "With the widespread availability of marijuana in recent years thanks to its legalization in a growing number of states, there has been increasing concern about the long-term health consequences on teens who might be able to get easier access to it illegally.\n\nA study published by the American Psychological Association in the journal Psychology of Addictive Behaviors this week should alleviate some of the worst fears.\n\nResearchers from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Rutgers University studied 408 males from adolescence to their mid-30s. The participants fell into four groups: those with no use or low use of marijuana, early chronic users, those who only smoked during their teens and those who began using it later and continued using the drug. The early chronic users smoked a great deal -- a peak of more than 200 days per year on average when they were 22 years old.\n\nThe researchers found no links to physical or mental health issues -- including depression, psychotic symptoms or asthma -- in any group, even those with very high use. They controlled for cigarette smoking, other drug use, access to health insurance and other factors.\n\n\"What we found was a little surprising,\" lead author Jordan Bechtold, a research fellow at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said in a statement.\n\nBased on other studies in the past that seemed to allude to marijuana use and later development of psychotic symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations, the researchers had thought they might find some associations to disease or other health conditions. But there were none.\n\nThey also found no link to a wide range of other health issues: cancer, asthma, respiratory problems, depression, anxiety, allergies, headaches or high blood pressure.\n\nBechtold said the researchers wanted to \"help inform the debate about legalization of marijuana\" but that this is a very complicated issue and one, study, including his own, should not be taken in isolation and should be viewed in context of other studies on teenagers' marijuana use.\n\nOne major limitation of the study is that it ends when the men are in their 30s \"which may be too early for decrements in health to emerge,\" the authors acknowledge. \"Therefore, continued data collection and longer follow-ups are needed.\"\n\nUpdate: The study's findings generated significant controversy along with requests for supplemental analysis, according to the editors of the Psychology of Addictive Behaviors. In a lengthy clarification issued in December 2015, the journal said that by applying different models to look at the data they confirmed that there did not appear to be any link between marijuana use and health issues. However, the reanalysis regarding psychotic disorders contradicted the earlier conclusions -- that there indeed appeared to be a higher risk of psychotic disorders among marijuana users in the study versus non-users that approached statistical significance when using a more liberal test.\n\nYour office thermostat is set for men's comfort.

An endometriosis pain treatment was just approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and it\u2019s expected to arrive at pharmacies as soon as August. The pill, called elagolix (brand name Orilissa), from the drugmaker AbbVie, is the first FDA-approved oral treatment in more than a decade for the moderate to severe pain that comes with endometriosis.\n\n\u201cThis [medication] could really be transformative,\u201d said Hugh Taylor, an OB-GYN at Yale Medical School who led the key trials testing the drug.\n\nEndometriosis is one of the most common gynecological conditions, affecting as many as one in 10 women of reproductive age. And it can be incredibly painful. The reason is simple: Women with the condition are growing excess tissue in their abdomen that they can\u2019t shed.\n\nEvery month, a woman\u2019s uterine lining thickens and sheds during her period if she\u2019s not pregnant. With endometriosis, that tissue thickens and bleeds, but it happens outside of the uterus \u2014 on the fallopian tubes, or even in the nose or lungs. Because the extra tissue has no way to exit the body (it can\u2019t go through the vagina since it\u2019s not growing in the uterus), it builds up and becomes trapped, leading to pain and, in some cases, infertility.\n\nThere\u2019s no cure for endometriosis. To manage symptoms, women are usually prescribed birth control or over-the-counter painkillers as a first-line approach, but they don\u2019t always work. In severe cases, a doctor may suggest \u201cexcision surgery\u201d to remove the extra tissue. (Dunham had eight surgeries and ended up getting a hysterectomy, which was considered an extreme measure.)\n\nEnter elagolix. Endometriosis is an estrogen-driven disease, and the drug works by lowering estrogen levels. Two large double-blind, placebo-control randomized trials, which 1,285 women completed, tested whether it can help women control endometriosis pain. The results, published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine, were impressive. The patients in those trials scored their pain from 0 (no pain) to 3 (severe pain). On average, they had pain levels of 2.2 out of 3 before starting on the drug \u2014 and they experienced a 2-point reduction in pain after taking the treatment for three months.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a major advance,\u201d said Dr. Louis DePaolo, head of the fertility and infertility branch at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, \u201cand another option women have that\u2019s effective.\u201d\n\nNow the less good news: The drug won\u2019t cure endometriosis; it\u2019ll only tamp down the pain it causes. Many women in the trial experienced the symptoms of menopause \u2014 hot flashes, headache, insomnia \u2014 and researchers have also found the drug causes bone loss. We have no idea about the long-term effects of taking the drug because there are no trials lasting for longer than a year, or how it stacks up against other painkillers (since the trials only compared it to placebo). That\u2019s not to mention cost: The drug\u2019s price is listed at $850 per month. But for some, the risks and costs may be worth it. Here\u2019s why.\n\nEndometriosis is incredibly common \u2014 but it can go undiagnosed for years\n\nEndometriosis is a chronic, sometimes highly disruptive condition. The three main ways it manifests are through pelvic pain, infertility, and pelvic masses such as cysts, scar tissue, and fibroids. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, some important signs of endometriosis include:\n\u2022 Pain before and during periods\n\nBut many women don\u2019t know they have endometriosis. It\u2019s sometimes mistaken or dismissed for regular period pain. Definitively diagnosing the disorder requires invasive surgery; doctors need to peer inside the pelvis through a laparoscopy. (Imaging is rarely helpful in getting a clear diagnosis.) This involves making a small incision in the belly and inserting a tube with a tiny camera to see if the pelvic organs show signs of tissue scarring and buildup. So it\u2019s no surprise it takes between three and 11 years after the onset of symptoms to diagnose endometriosis.\n\nDoctors aren\u2019t sure why some women get it\n\nAdding to the mystery around endometriosis: No one knows exactly what causes it, but doctors have some theories.\n\u2022 Retrograde menstrual flow: During a period, when a woman is shedding her uterine lining, some of that tissue can flow through her fallopian tubes and into her pelvis, which researchers think may cause endometriosis. But doctors have also found that the rate of retrograde menstruation is about the same in women with and without endometriosis, so they think additional factors spur the disorder in some.\n\u2022 Genes: The disorder runs in families, so doctors believe there\u2019s a genetic component. If a woman\u2019s mom or sister had endometriosis, the woman is believed to be at a higher risk.\n\u2022 Somatic mutations: Researchers are also finding that somatic mutations \u2014 acquired changes to DNA that happen after a person is born \u2014 may also be an endometriosis driver.\n\u2022 Immune system dysfunction: Problems with the immune system can hamper a woman\u2019s ability to clear her menstrual debris, leading to endometriosis.\n\u2022 Environmental factors: There\u2019s some evidence to suggest environmental exposures to certain chemicals may contribute to one\u2019s risk of developing endometriosis.\n\nThe treatments available don\u2019t always help, and some have severe side effects\n\nWhen birth control pills or over-the-counter painkillers fail to help endometriosis pain, women are often left choosing between a monthly injection called Lupron Depot, which can put women into a profoundly menopausal state, or Danazol, a male hormone that often causes acne and facial hair growth.\n\nIn women for whom these drugs aren\u2019t effective, or who don\u2019t want to take medications, surgery to remove the displaced endometrial tissue can be a highly effective option. But the trouble with surgery is that endometriosis can recur, so women may need more surgeries. The success of surgery also depends on finding a skilled and experienced surgeon, and there\u2019s always the risk of surgical complications.\n\nThe new drug elagolix is not risk-free, either. In the trials, women who took the drug had greater bone loss than did those who received placebo, and this wasn\u2019t entirely surprising. Like other endometriosis treatments, the drug works by lowering estrogen levels (since endometriosis needs estrogen to grow). When that happens, women experience menopausal side effects. The most common in the trials were hot flashes, headaches, and insomnia. (Elagolix is available in two doses \u2014 150 mg per day, or 200 mg twice daily \u2014 and the women on the higher dose experienced the side effects more frequently.) Mood swings and night sweats were less common, and one woman in the trial died by suicide (though there\u2019s no indication that the medicine was a cause of her death).\n\nDePaolo pointed out, \u201c[Elagolix] doesn\u2019t have the pronounced side effects some of the other compounds have.\u201d That\u2019s because, he said, it doesn\u2019t drive down estrogen levels as severely.\n\nBut for patients who have tried other estrogen-lowering medicines, elagolix isn\u2019t all that appealing. \u201cThis drug is palliative in nature. It does not cure or shrink the disease,\u201d Casey Berna, director of programs and partnerships for the advocacy group EndoWhat. The drug\u2019s side effects also concerned her, as did the lack of knowledge about its long-term impact.\n\nFor other women, though, the trade offs may be worth it. But in either case, women with severe endometriosis are still left choosing between terrible pain, surgery, or drugs with serious side effects.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The text offers a likely date when this just-approved drug would become available at pharmacies.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Oct. 26, 2012 -- Hypnosis is an effective treatment for menopause-related hot flashes and night sweats, new research finds. The alternative therapy reduced hot flashes by as much as 74% in the study conducted by researchers at Baylor University\u2019s Mind-Body Medicine Research Laboratory and funded by the National Institutes of Health. Only hormone therapy, which many women can\u2019t take or want to avoid, is more effective for treating the most common symptom of menopause, says researcher Gary R. Elkins, PhD. \u201cIf you compare this treatment with off-label use of antidepressants or other non-hormonal therapies, it works as well or better,\u201d he says.\n\nHot flashes are a sudden rush of heat, followed by facial flushing and sweating, often followed by chills and clamminess. The progression is familiar to most women of a certain age. Hot flashes and night sweats are the most common symptoms of menopause, affecting some 80% of women. They are linked to declining estrogen levels, but it remains unclear just why the sudden lack of estrogen sends the body into thermal mayhem, and why some women are more affected than others. Hormone therapy is a very effective treatment for menopause-related hot flashes, but concerns about risks have limited its use among women. \u201cThere is certainly a need for non-pharmacologic treatments for hot flashes and night sweats,\u201d says North American Menopause Society (NAMS) Executive Director Margery Gass, MD.\n\nIn an earlier study, Elkins and his Baylor colleagues showed that hypnosis dramatically reduced hot flash and night sweat frequency in breast cancer patients with treatment-related symptoms. In the newly published study, they set out to determine if the alternative treatment would do the same in women whose symptoms were related to menopause.

Now, researchers have shed light on what one type of time-restricted eating does to the body.\n\nIn a small, preliminary study, researchers put 23 obese volunteers on the 16:8 diet, a form of intermittent fasting. Followers of the popular regime eat during an eight-hour window, in this case between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. And for the 16 hours in between, they consume only calorie-free drinks, such as water.\n\nFor 12 weeks, the scientists measured various factors, including the participants' fat mass, blood pressure and cholesterol and glucose levels. The researchers compared the results to existing data from a separate weight loss trial carried out between 2011 and 2015.\n\nIndividuals who ate between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. consumed around 350 fewer calories, resulting in a loss of 3 percent body weight, and their blood pressure dropped by around 7mm Hg. However, their fat mass, insulin resistance and cholesterol levels were similar to the control group's.\n\nKrista Varady, one of the study's authors and associate professor of kinesiology and nutrition at the University of Illinois at Chicago's School of Applied Health Sciences, said in a statement that the take-home message from the study is that cutting out certain foods or counting calories aren\u2019t the only effective methods for losing weight.\n\nThe authors noted that the results mirror those from previous studies of other forms of intermittent fasting, including alternate day fasting, where an individual eats normally every other day.\n\n\"But one of the benefits of the 16:8 diet may be that it is easier for people to maintain. We observed that fewer participants dropped out of this study when compared to studies on other fasting diets,\u201d said Varady.\n\nFurther research is now needed to uncover whether 16:8 works better than other fasting diets in terms of weight loss and health benefits.\n\nThe study's authors acknowledged that their preliminary data offers \"promise for the use of time-restricted feeding as a weight loss technique in obese adults, but longer-term, large-scale randomized controlled trials [are needed].\"\n\nVarady stressed that \"when it comes to weight loss, people need to find what works for them, because even small amounts of success can lead to improvements in metabolic health.\"\n\nCommenting broadly on fast-style diets, James Catterson of the Institute of Healthy Ageing at University College London, who was not involved in the study, previously told Newsweek the jury is still out on fasting diets.\n\nHe said that the data on the effects of fasting in animals are more convincing, probably because animals can be investigated in large sample sizes and in a highly controlled environment that is almost impossible to replicate in humans.\n\n\"There are also many studies that either report no overall effect or sometimes the opposite.

This is the first product in its class (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors) approved to treat this type of cancer.\n\n\"Tecentriq provides these patients with a new therapy targeting the PD-L1 pathway,\" said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \"Products that block PD-1/PD-L1 interactions are part of an evolving story about the relationship between the body's immune system and its interaction with cancer cells.\"\n\nTecentriq targets the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway (proteins found on the body's immune cells and some cancer cells). By blocking these interactions, Tecentriq may help the body's immune system fight cancer cells. Tecentriq is the first FDA-approved PD-L1 inhibitor and the latest in the broader class of PD-1/PD-L1 targeted biologics approved by the FDA in the last two years.\n\nTecentriq is approved for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma whose disease has worsened during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or within 12 months of receiving platinum-containing chemotherapy, either before (neoadjuvant) or after (adjuvant) surgical treatment. Urothelial carcinoma is the most common type of bladder cancer and occurs in the urinary tract system, involving the bladder and related organs. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) estimates 76,960 new cases of bladder cancer and 16,390 deaths from the disease in 2016.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Tecentriq were studied in a single-arm clinical trial involving 310 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. This trial measured the percentage of patients who experienced complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors (objective response rate). The study also looked at the difference in effect based on \"positive\" versus \"negative\" expression of the PD-L1 protein on patients' tumor-infiltrating immune cells. In all patients, 14.8 percent of participants experienced at least a partial shrinkage of their tumors, an effect that lasted from more than 2.1 to more than 13.8 months at the time of the response analysis. In patients who were classified as \"positive\" for PD-L1 expression, 26 percent of participants experienced a tumor response (compared to 9.5 percent of participants who were classified as \"negative\" for PD-L1 expression).\n\nWhile patients who received Tecentriq experienced a tumor response across the study, the greater effect in those who were classified as \"positive\" for PD-L1 expression suggests that the level of PD-L1 expression in tumor-infiltrating immune cells may help identify patients who are more likely to respond to treatment with Tecentriq. Therefore, today the FDA also approved the Ventana PD-L1 (SP142) assay to detect PD-L1 protein expression levels on patients' tumor-infiltrating immune cells and help physicians determine which patients may benefit most from treatment with Tecentriq.\n\nThe most common side effects of treatment with Tencentriq were fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, urinary tract infection, fever (pyrexia) and constipation. Tencentriq also has the potential to cause infection and serious side effects that result from the immune system effect of Tencentriq (known as \"immune-mediated side effects\"). These severe immune-mediated side effects involve healthy organs, including the lung, colon and endocrine system.\n\nThe FDA granted the Tecentriq application breakthrough therapy designation, priority review status and accelerated approval for this indication. These are distinct programs intended to facilitate and expedite the development and review of certain new drugs in light of their potential to benefit patients with serious or life-threatening conditions.\n\nTecentriq is marketed by Genentech based in San Francisco, California.

The study involved people who had a first episode that was suggestive of MS, such as numbness, vision problems or problems with balance, and an MRI that showed signs of possible MS. Up to 85 percent of people in this situation, which is called clinically isolated syndrome, will in time be diagnosed with MS. \u201cNot much research has been done on how starting treatment this early affects the long-term course of the disease,\u201d said study author Ludwig Kappos, MD, of University Hospital Basel in Basel, Switzerland, and a member of the American Academy of Neurology. \u201cOur study adds to the evidence supporting treatment at the earliest sign of the disease and indicates that early treatment has a long-lasting effect on disease activity.\u201d The study started with 468 people randomly assigned to receive either early treatment with interferon beta-1b or a placebo. After participants were diagnosed with MS or after two years, the participants on the placebo could switch to interferon beta-1b or another drug. After 11 years, researchers reevaluated the 278 people who were still participating in the study, which included 167 people in the early group and 111 people in the delayed group. Those who received the early treatment were 33 percent less likely to be diagnosed with MS than those who received the delayed treatment. People in the early group also had more time before their first relapse of the disease than people in the delayed group, with 1,888 days compared to 931 days. The early group also had a lower overall yearly relapse rate of 0.21 compared to 0.26 for the delayed group, which is 19 percent lower. There was no difference between the two groups in the tests that measure overall disability or in MRI scans measuring the amount of damage caused by the disease. \u201cOverall, early treatment appears to have a benefit on relapses, especially early in the disease, but limited effects on other outcome measures, including outcomes reported by patients,\u201d said Brian C.

The Mediterranean diet included poultry, fish and some red meat as well as fruits, vegetables, beans and whole grains. After three months, the participants switched diets.

Survival was shown to be greatest among those prescribed first-generation nonselective beta-blockers. According to The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center investigators, the drugs block the effects of stress pathways involved in tumor growth and spread. With further research, they may also prove beneficial in conjunction with other treatment regimens and across other cancer types.\n\nPublished today in the journal CANCER, the findings are the result of a multi-institutional retrospective analysis of the medical records of 1,425 women with ovarian cancer treated between 2000 and 2010. Researchers compared overall survival among patients with documented beta-blocker use during chemotherapy and those without. Among the 269 patients who received beta-blockers, 193 (71.7 percent) received beta-1-adrenergic receptor selective agents (SBBs) and the remaining patients received nonselective beta antagonists (NSBBs). The research team found:\n\u2022 For patients receiving any beta-blocker, the median overall survival was 47.8 months versus 42 months for nonusers.\n\u2022 Median overall survival based on beta-blocker receptor selectivity was 94.9 months for those receiving NSBBs versus 38 months for those receiving SBBs.\n\u2022 Even among patients with hypertension, a longer median overall survival was observed among users of NSBBs compared with nonusers (90 months versus 38.2 months).\n\nThis study builds on a large body of research by principal investigator Anil Sood, M.D., professor in Gynecologic Medical Oncology and Cancer Biology at MD Anderson. It showed that stress hormones fuel progression of ovarian and other cancers, and that beta-blockers - among the most proven drugs in cardiovascular medicine - might be a new way to stifle that effect.\n\n\"Beta-blockers treat a variety of conditions, such as heart disease, high-blood pressure, glaucoma and migraines. They target a receptor protein in heart muscle that causes the heart to beat harder and faster when activated by stress hormones,\" Sood said. \"Our research has shown that the same stress mechanisms impact ovarian cancer progression, so these drugs could play a new role in cancer treatment.\"\n\nAccording to Sood, the usefulness of beta-blockers was unclear until now. \"The ability to show improved survival using nonselective agents - which inhibit a specific stress pathway - is the culmination of years of research into ovarian cancer biology and pathogenesis.\"\n\nHe added that beta-blocker users in the study presented at a higher stage of disease, had an increased average BMI and were more likely to be hypertensive. All these factors were associated with decreased survival, yet those who received beta-blockers had either equivalent or improved overall survival. Further examination revealed that NSBB users had improved overall survival regardless of the presence of such prognostic factors or comorbidities. This was not true for patients who took SBBs.\n\nAlthough further study is needed, these results highlight the importance of adrenergic receptor-\u03b22 (ADRB2), a signaling pathway important to ovarian carcinogenesis and targeted by NSBBs (versus the ADRB1 pathway targeted by SBBs).\n\nOvarian cancer is the 5th most deadly cancer among women, accounting for more deaths than any other female reproductive system cancer. An estimated 21,290 new cases are diagnosed, and some 14,180 women die from the disease each year in the U.S., according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nFuture trials will seek to identify patients who would benefit most from beta-blocker use and the best beta-blocker for a specific tumor type based on adrenergic receptor expression. Then they potentially could be used as an adjuvant therapy during surgical recovery and chemotherapy to decrease tumor growth, delays in wound healing and metastasis. Beta-blockers may also reduce cancer-related psychological distress in newly diagnosed patients, according to the study authors.\n\nThere are currently two clinical trials, one led by MD Anderson, evaluating the combination of chemotherapy and propranolol (a type of NSBB) on cancer biology and on stress modulators in patients with newly diagnosed EOC. According to Sood, the preliminary data from these feasibility trials will be used to design prospective, randomized clinical trials examining NSBBs on patient outcomes.\n\n\"The stratification of patients by beta-blocker use and selectivity in this study makes it unique among all other studies examining the impact of these drugs on cancer. It also builds on the mounting evidence that beta-blockers may become a key treatment component for many patients in the future,\" said Sood.\n\nPortions of this study were supported by National Institutes of Health grants (CA140933, CA104825, CA109298, P50CA083639, U54CA151688, U54CA96300, U54CA96297, and CA016672), an Ovarian Cancer Research Fund program Project Development Grant, the Department of Defense (grants OC073399, W81XWJ-10-0158, and OC100237), the Betty Ann Asche Murray Distinguished Professorship, the RGK Foundation, the Gilder Foundation, the Blanton-Davis Ovarian Cancer Research Program, and a Gynecologic Cancer Foundation-St. Louis Ovarian Cancer Awareness grant.

For the study, researchers from Lund University in Sweden recruited 121 young adults who had injured their A.C.L.\u2019s. The volunteers, between 18 and 35, were physically active, and many were competitive athletes. They agreed, rather bravely, to be randomly assigned to one of two groups and accept radically different treatments for their torn A.C.L.\u2019s. The first group began physical therapy and then underwent surgical reconstruction of the ligament, considered by many people to be the best option for injured athletes. The second group received only physical therapy, with the option to have the operation later. Twenty-three subjects of that group did eventually have the operation. (For those fortunate enough not to be personally familiar with A.C.L. surgery, reconstruction involves replacing the injured ligament with tissue from elsewhere in your own leg or from a cadaver.)\n\nOver two years, the injured knees were assessed using a comprehensive numerical score that rated pain, function during activity and other measures. At the time of the original injury, the knee also had been scored. At the end of the two years, both groups showed considerable improvement. The scores for the surgically repaired knees had risen by 39.2 points. The scores for the more conservatively treated knees also had risen, by 39.4 points. In other words, the outcomes were virtually identical. Despite a widespread belief that surgery leads to a stronger knee, the results showed that surgically reconstructing the A.C.L. as soon as possible after the tear \u201cwas not superior\u201d to more conservative treatment, the study\u2019s authors wrote. The findings suggest, the authors concluded, that \u201cmore than half the A.C.L. reconstructions\u201d currently being conducted on injured knees \u201ccould be avoided without adversely affecting outcomes.\u201d\n\nThis possibility should reverberate across playing fields nationwide, where, at the moment, preseason high school, collegiate and adult-league sports practices are under way, with a concomitant surge in A.C.L. tears. By one estimate, as many as 1 in every 556 fit, active people will tear an A.C.L. \u2014 particularly if they participate in sports that involve frequent pivoting and landing, like soccer, football, tennis, skiing and basketball. At the same time, the urge to treat the injury with surgery appears to be growing. The \u201cbelief among most surgeons and patients is that surgery is a \u2018must,\u2019 at least if you aim to go back into an active lifestyle,\u201d the Swedish authors of the study e-mailed in response to questions.\n\nPart of the reason for A.C.L. surgery\u2019s popularity is that by most measures, it works. In the current study, most of the group members who had reconstructive surgery reported that their injured knees felt healthy after two years and that they had returned to activity \u2014 not, in most cases, at the same level as before their injuries, but they were active. Significantly, their knees also were notably more \u201cstable\u201d than the joints that hadn\u2019t been surgically fixed. Stability is, in theory, desirable. A stable knee rarely gives way.\n\nBut in practice, the importance of stability after A.C.L. treatment is \u201ccontroversial,\u201d The New England Journal study\u2019s authors, Richard Frobell, Ph.D., and Stefan Lohmander, M.D., Ph.D., of Lund University, wrote in their e-mail. In an important 2009 study published in The British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers retrospectively compared outcomes after 10 years in competitive athletes who had surgery or had opted for conservative treatment of their torn A.C.L.\u2019s. The surgically repaired knees were notably more stable. But they weren\u2019t fundamentally healthier. The surgically reconstructed knees and the conservatively treated joints experienced similar (and high) levels of early onset knee arthritis, a common occurrence after an A.C.L. tear. The treatments were almost identical, too, in terms of whether the athletes could return to sports and whether they reported subsequent knee problems.\n\nWhy, then, undergo A.C.L. reconstruction, an operation that can be expensive and, like all surgical procedures, carries risks? Several top-flight orthopedic surgeons I contacted say that they remain convinced that surgery leads to a better long-term outcome for certain patients, particularly if they want to return to pivoting sports. \u201cThe reason to have the surgery is to preserve\u201d other parts of the knee from injury during activity, says Dr. Warren Dunn, an assistant professor of orthopedics and rehabilitation at Vanderbilt University who has extensively studied A.C.L. tears. He points out that in The New England Journal of Medicine study, only 8 percent of the patients in the first surgical group subsequently tore a meniscus, a fragile pillow of cartilage that can rip if a knee gives way. Twenty-five percent of those in the physical therapy group eventually tore their meniscuses.\n\nWhat these numbers mean for anyone who tears an A.C.L. or is the parent of a young athlete in that situation is that they should have a long, frank conversation with an orthopedic surgeon and possibly also a nonsurgical sports-medicine specialist about options. \u201cWe recommend surgery based on activity level and sports,\u201d Dr. Dunn says. \u201cMost subjects can do in-line activities\u201d like running or biking \u201cwithout an A.C.L.\u201d He adds, \u201cOn the other hand, we believe that A.C.L.-deficient subjects that do return\u201d to sports involving cutting, pivoting or planting the leg \u201ccan consequently injure the meniscus\u201d or other cartilage in the knee and would benefit from a replacement A.C.L.\n\nThe authors of the study are less sure. \u201cOn the basis of our study results, we\u2019d tell patients\u201d that \u201cthere is no apparent downside of starting a good rehab program and waiting with the surgery decision to see if it is needed or not,\u201d the authors wrote to me.\n\nThe ultimate lesson of The New England Journal study is almost certainly that more science on the subject is needed. \u201cWe definitely know only parts of the long-term outcome\u201d after different A.C.L. treatments, says Dr. Duncan Meuffels, an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam and lead author of The British Journal of Sports Medicine study.\n\nBut large-scale, randomized controlled studies, the gold standard of medical research, may be difficult to orchestrate, in part because people with shredded A.C.L.\u2019s can balk at being denied surgery. In The New England Journal study, some of those assigned to physical therapy wound up requesting surgery, although they weren\u2019t experiencing any knee problems. For them, it seems, \u201cthe desire to undergo surgery was based on expectations rather than symptoms,\u201d the authors told me. It may be years, unfortunately, before we know if such expectations are justified or if unreconstructed injured knees can be fine.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "It\u2019s clear that ACL\u00a0surgery and physical therapy are available.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "IRVINE, Calif., May 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Proove\u00ae Biosciences, Inc. announces a new study validating the accuracy of precision medicine technology to predict prescription opioid abuse.

Meanwhile, the American Cancer Society continues to recommend that women get mammograms every year beginning at age 40.\n\nThe frequency of screening mammograms -- and the appropriate age to begin them -- has been debated since the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in 2009 recommended that women routinely get screening mammograms every other year starting at age 50.\n\nOct. 17, 2011 -- Getting screening mammograms every two years instead of annually reduces the chance of a false alarm, a new study shows.\n\nAfter 10 years of annual screening, more than half of women will be called back at least once for another mammogram.

Julia Belluz will sift through the research and consult with experts in the field to figure out how science can help us live happier and healthier lives.\n\nHave a question? Use our submission form or ask @juliaoftoronto on Twitter.\n\nWhat's the difference between Tylenol, Advil, and aspirin? Which is the best to take for pain?\n\nI used to take acetaminophen (usually referred to by its brand name, Tylenol) for the occasional headache or sore muscle, mostly because that's what we used in my house growing up. I didn't think much about whether it was more or less effective than any other type of over-the-counter pain reliever, and I suspect the same is true for many folks. Acetaminophen, after all, is the most popular over-the-counter painkiller worldwide.\n\nSo I was surprised when I found out there's a huge gap between how pain researchers think about this drug and how the public does. More specifically, every researcher I contacted for this piece said some variation of what Andrew Moore, a pain researcher at Oxford University, told me: Tylenol doesn't actually work that well for pain. To be more exact, he said, \"I can't imagine why anybody would take acetaminophen.\"\n\nMoore has done a number of systematic reviews on over-the-counter pain medications, looking at all the available evidence to figure out which ones work best for various problems. I asked him to describe the overall success rates for the most common three: acetaminophen (like Tylenol), ibuprofen (like Advil), and aspirin.\n\nLike all good evidence-based medicine thinkers, he was able to provide a very practical answer: \"If you\u2019re talking about aspirin in doses of 500 to 1,000 mg or two tablets, 30 percent of people get relief from acute pain. For acetaminophen at doses of 500 to 1,000 mg, about 40 percent have a success. For ibuprofen, in its normal formulation at something around 400 mg or two tablets, about 50 percent have success.\"\n\nNow, Moore was referring here to acute pain that strikes after a specific event, like a surgery, a cut, or a burn, but his message was simple: Ibuprofen seems to work best, followed by acetaminophen, and then aspirin.\n\nFor ongoing (or chronic) pain \u2014 a sore lower back, say, or the kind of degenerative arthritis that typically develops with age \u2014 ibuprofen still outperforms acetaminophen.\n\n\"WE FOUND THAT [TYLENOL] IS INEFFECTIVE ON BOTH PAIN AND DISABILITY OUTCOMES FOR LOW BACK PAIN\" A 2015 systematic review of high-quality evidence, published in the BMJ, found that acetaminophen didn't seem to help most sufferers of chronic low back pain, and that it barely alleviates pain in people with osteoarthritis. As the researchers wrote, \"We found that [acetaminophen] is ineffective on both pain and disability outcomes for low back pain in the immediate and short term and is not clinically superior to placebo on both pain and disability outcomes for osteoarthritis.\"\n\nA limitation of the study is that the evidence on acetaminophen was mainly for acute low back pain, but as the University of Leeds's Philip Conaghan explained, \"There is very little long-term data [on chronic back pain], and if a drug doesn't work in the acute problem, it seems unlikely to work in the chronic phase \u2014 though back pain may be even more complex than osteoarthritis pain.\"\n\nThe study also noted that patients on acetaminophen \"are nearly four times more likely to have abnormal results on liver function tests compared with those taking oral placebo.\"\n\nOther studies, like this well-designed randomized control trial of people with knee pain, have similar conclusions: Acetaminophen doesn't perform as well as ibuprofen, and it's linked to higher rates of liver problems. (Ibuprofen also has potential side effects; more on that below.)\n\nSo what about the occasional headache? What works best for that?\n\nIt turns out this is another fascinating problem area for pain researchers. Moore has looked at all the evidence for what he calls \"infrequent tension headaches\" and found \"it is surprising how poor [the research] is and how little it tells us.\" Either the outcomes in studies are badly defined, the studies have too few participants to say anything concrete, or many people in the studies actually seem to have chronic headaches as opposed to the ordinary ones the researchers are allegedly studying.\n\n\"Most people would say, if you look at the data, take an ibuprofen tablet,\" Moore said. \"Acetaminophen is just not a very good analgesic [pain reliever], yet it\u2019s the go-to drug because it\u2019s thought to be safe.\"\n\nAnd that's where things get even more interesting: Acetaminophen isn't actually that safe.\n\n\"We always thought [acetaminophen] was safe, but there are increasing signals of accidental overdose in people who are regularly using it for chronic pain, and some liver toxicity,\" explained Conaghan, who has studied adverse events data related to this popular drug.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2003, acetaminophen was the leading cause of acute liver failure in the US. There are also hundreds of related deaths every year \u2014 though keep in mind that millions of people take drugs with acetaminophen, so these more extreme side effects are rare (especially if you're only taking them in small doses occasionally). Still, for the drug's minimal pain-killing benefits, the risks may not be worth it. \n\n\n\n\"Don't believe that just because something is over-the-counter, it\u2019s safe,\" Conaghan added. (He advised people to see their doctor if they're taking any of these painkillers for more than a few days \u2014 particularly if they're on other drugs already.)\n\n\"[Tylenol] is an old drug, obsolete, and should be avoided altogether\"\n\nKay Brune, a professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Germany's Friedrich-Alexander University who has also studied the toxicity of painkillers, was even more direct in his thoughts on acetaminophen: \"It's an old drug, obsolete, and should be avoided altogether.\"\n\nAspirin is safer than acetaminophen, he said, though to be used as a pain reliever it requires much higher doses \u2014 which can have side effects like stomach upset. Aspirin also interferes with blood coagulation for days after taking it. \"If you take one gram of aspirin,\" Brune explained, \"you're at risk of bleeding for another four days.\" This is why aspirin has its place as a protective agent against strokes and heart attacks for people at a higher risk.\n\nIbuprofen doesn't have these two problems \u2014 it's less toxic than the others in the doses that give people pain relief. But it has other side effects. \"Ibuprofen puts people at risk of bleeds in the gastrointestinal tract and kidney damage \u2014 so it's not free of risk,\" said Brune. Using it in high doses also seems to raise blood pressure and increase the risk of heart attack and stroke \u2014 one reason the Food and Drug Administration recently warned people should only use ibuprofen (and other \"nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,\" or NSAIDS, like naproxen) for short periods of time and in small amounts.\n\n\n\nI asked Brune about what he'd suggest for the occasional headache or sore muscle. \"Taking 400 mg of ibuprofen won't cause measurable harm,\" he answered. \"Of all drugs we have available, for most indications, it's also the most effective one.\"\n\nIs acetaminophen good for anything?\n\nIf the research community seems to have sided with ibuprofen for pain, is acetaminophen good for anything?\n\n\n\nYes. There are some groups of people with health complications who shouldn't take ibuprofen. For example, patients with kidney, gastric, cardiovascular, or bleeding problems may need to avoid NSAIDS like ibuprofen, so doctors might suggest Tylenol in these cases. \n\n\n\nThere's also some evidence that NSAIDS may increase the risk of psychosis and cognitive impairment in the elderly, so doctors may avoid prescribing these drugs for older patients. And Tylenol is generally considered safer than Advil or aspirin for pregnant women.\n\n\n\nFever is another area where acetaminophen can help, said Moore. According to one systematic review, acetaminophen seems to be safe for treating very young kids with fever, and you can give children as young as 3 months old acetaminophen, whereas you need to wait until kids are at least 6 months old to safely treat them with ibuprofen. This may help to explain the popularity of drugs like Tylenol for kids.\n\nBut a final caveat here: If your child is older than 6 months, it's not all that clear that acetaminophen outperforms ibuprofen for reducing fevers, and the same is true for adults. So keep that in mind the next time you confront your medicine cabinet.\n\nSend your questions to Julia via the submission form or @juliaoftoronto on Twitter.

Steve Byrd, MD, and colleagues of Pediatric Plastic Surgery Institute, Dallas. Dr. Byrd comments, \"The EarWell system is effective in eliminating or reducing the need for surgery in all but the most severe congenital ear malformations.\"\n\nThe researchers review their experience with nonsurgical correction of congenital ear malformations in 175 infants. The EarWell system is a relatively simple technique for molding and reshaping the ear, taking advantage of the increased malleability of the ear cartilage in newborns. For best results, treatment should start within the first three weeks after birth, or correspondingly later in infants born prematurely.\n\nThe technique and length of EarWell treatment varies according to the type and severity of the infant's ear deformity. Dr. Byrd and colleagues present a classification system and technical details for plastic surgeons to follow in evaluating the best treatment for specific types of malformations.\n\nFor most infants in the study, both ears were treated, for a total of 303 ears. Ninety-eight percent of infants had relatively mild \"constricted\"-type ear deformities. EarWell treatment started at an average age of 12 days and continued for 37 days, including an average of six follow-up visits to the plastic surgeon's office.\n\nEarWell treatment was highly successful in correcting or reducing the severity of congenital ear malformations. Results were judged good to excellent in 97 percent of ears with one simple deformity and 88 percent with more complex \"mixed\" deformities. About 70 percent of ears with constricted malformations were graded as having no deformity after treatment.\n\nComplications consisted mainly of skin injuries that healed without further problems. In eight cases, treatment had to be stopped because of an allergic reaction to the adhesive tape used.\n\nWhile the EarWell system is not new, the report is the largest study of congenital ear malformations treated with this approach--including a standardized approach to treatment and assessment of the results. The results strongly support its use, especially in infants with deformities and less-severe malformations.\n\nBut lack of awareness of this nonsurgical alternative is a key limiting factor. \"The opportunity for early treatment can be hampered by a failure to convince pediatricians that the majority of misshapen newborn ears do not self-correct,\" Dr. Byrd and coauthors write. They also point out that EarWell is highly successful in the treatment of prominent ears--a condition that commonly goes unnoticed by parents and pediatricians, but is likely to get worse as the child grows.\n\n\"While we can operate on ears later in the patient's life, waiting not only increases the surgery's difficulty and expense, but may expose the child to teasing, bullying, and loss of self-esteem,\" comments Editor-in-Chief Rod J.

Upon walking into a public restroom, you'd likely do just the opposite--abruptly limiting the flow of air through your nose. Now, researchers reporting in the Cell Press journal Current Biology on July 2 have found that people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) don't make this natural adjustment like other people do. Autistic children go right on sniffing in the same way, no matter how pleasant or awful the scent.\n\nThe findings suggest that non-verbal tests related to smell might serve as useful early indicators of ASD, the researchers say.\n\n\"The difference in sniffing pattern between the typically developing children and children with autism was simply overwhelming,\" says Noam Sobel of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.\n\nEarlier evidence had indicated that people with autism have impairments in \"internal action models,\" the brain templates we rely on to seamlessly coordinate our senses and actions. It wasn't clear if this impairment would show up in a test of the sniff response, however.\n\nTo find out, Sobel, along with Liron Rozenkrantz and their colleagues, presented 18 children with ASD and 18 normally developing children (17 boys and 1 girl in each group) with pleasant and unpleasant odors and measured their sniff responses. The average age of children in the study was 7. While typical children adjusted their sniffing within 305 milliseconds of smelling an odor, the researchers report, children on the autism spectrum showed no such response.\n\nThat difference in sniff response between the two groups of kids was enough to correctly classify them as children with or without a diagnosis of ASD 81% of the time. Moreover, the researchers report that increasingly aberrant sniffing was associated with increasingly severe autism symptoms, based on social but not motor impairments.\n\nThe findings suggest that a sniff test could be quite useful in the clinic, although the researchers emphasize that their test is in no way ready for that yet.\n\n\"We can identify autism and its severity with meaningful accuracy within less than 10 minutes using a test that is completely non-verbal and entails no task to follow,\" Sobel says. \"This raises the hope that these findings could form the base for development of a diagnostic tool that can be applied very early on, such as in toddlers only a few months old. Such early diagnosis would allow for more effective intervention.\"\n\nThe researchers now plan to test whether the sniff-response pattern they've observed is specific to autism or whether it might show up also in people with other neurodevelopmental conditions.

It doesn't involve any high-priced new pharmaceuticals -- the key may be an over-the-counter vitamin supplement that costs less than $10 a month.\n\nResearchers found that a form of vitamin B3 called nicotinamide could help reduce the chance of skin cancer recurring in patients who've had it before. (Another popular form of Vitamin B3 called niacin was not used in this study.)\n\nFor the study, researchers in Australia looked at nearly 400 people who had had at least two non-melanoma skin cancers. They found patients who took vitamin B3 twice a day cut their chances of developing new skin cancers by 23 percent.\n\n\"That's a dramatic number,\" Dr. David Agus, director of USC's Norris Westside Cancer Center, told \"CBS This Morning.\" \"It could make a major impact.\"\n\nDr. Jae Jung, a dermatologist at City of Hope cancer center in Duarte, California, agreed. \"If you can reduce the new skin cancer rates for these patients, it would be an enormous benefit,\" she told CBS News.\n\nHow does it work? Sunlight's ultraviolet (UV) rays can damage the DNA in skin cells, increasing the risk for skin cancer. Researchers say vitamin B3 gives skin cells an energy boost -- \"turns back on the immune system,\" in Agus's words -- helping them repair the damage.\n\nNearly 5 million people are treated for skin cancer in the U.S. each year, and the Skin Cancer Foundation says 1 out of 5 Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime.\n\nThe two most common forms of the disease, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, can usually be treated successfully. The most dangerous type, melanoma, occurs in about 73,000 people in the U.S. each year and kills more than 9,900.\n\nOne patient who could benefit from the vitamin treatment is Charity Wiese, who has been diagnosed with skin cancer more than two dozen times in the last five years.

These are early results, but if replicated may mean that treatment of some mental health problems could benefit from the inclusion of dietary advice. This is presented at the ECNP Conference in Barcelona.\n\nBipolar Disorder (which used to be called 'manic depression') is characterised by episodes of mood swings, between being very up or very down with periods in between the two extremes. The fact that there are two opposite sets of symptoms means that finding an effective treatment is difficult. While current medications are useful, they are better at targeting mania symptoms (the 'up' phase), leaving a lack of effective treatment for people experiencing depressive episodes. Now a group of Australian, German and American scientists have shown those who have a high quality diet, a less inflammatory diet, and/or a low BMI (Body Mass Index) may respond better to an add-on nutraceutical treatment provided as part of a clinical trial.\n\n\"If we can confirm these results, then it's good news for people with Bipolar Disorder, as there is a great need for better treatments for the depressive phase of Bipolar Disorder\" said lead researcher Melanie Ashton of Deakin University in Australia.\n\nA total of 133 participants were randomly assigned to take a combination of nutraceuticals (compounds derived from foods such as vitamins or minerals that treat or prevent a disease or disorder) including the anti-inflammatory amino acid n-acetylcysteine (NAC), or NAC alone, or a placebo (a dummy pill) for 16 weeks. Participants received the study medication in addition to any stable treatments they were already receiving. Researchers measured BMI at the beginning of the study, and then measured depression and how a person is able to function in their day to day life. Researchers also rated whether a participant was improving and, if so, how much, over the next 20 weeks. Participants filled in a questionnaire about what they usually eat over the year and researchers calculated a diet quality score, where good diets included a healthy diet with lots of fruit and vegetables, whereas poorer-quality diets had more saturated fat, refined carbohydrates and alcohol. These types of diets were then categorised as either anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory based on foods that affect inflammation.\n\nMelanie Ashton continued, \"We found that people who had a better-quality diet, a diet with anti-inflammatory properties, or a lower BMI, showed better response to add-on nutraceutical treatment than did those who reported a low-quality diet, or a diet including foods that promote inflammation, or who were overweight.\n\nWhat this means, if these results can be repeated in a larger trial, is that treatment for Bipolar Disorder would need to take into account what a person eats and their weight.\n\nThere are some points we need to note about this study. This is a randomised, controlled trial, but what we found were exploratory outcomes; in other words, it wasn't the main result that we were testing.

One way an aspiring mother can make it easier is to know when she\u2019s most fertile, a period spanning a few days every month when her body undergoes hormonal changes. And certain body-tracking wristbands may be able to detect these subtle shifts in your biometrics, like your heart rate and body temperature. Depending on the device, it could even help you go one step further and actually conceive. Recently, the women\u2019s health data startup Clue ran an internal test to see if Fitbits could improve the experience of women who track their periods on its popular app and are trying to get pregnant. Scientists put Fitbits on five employees and found that the devices could track their resting heart rate patterns during their menstrual cycles. The devices also showed that resting heart rate spiked shortly before ovulation began, according to the Berlin company, which presented data from the small, preliminary study at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology's annual meeting this month.\n\nThe advantage of a passive sensor is \"these things are done kind of autonomously so you don't need to do much except check when the resting heart rate starts coming up,\" Clue's head of scientific research, Dr. Vedrana H\u00f6gqvist Tabor, told BuzzFeed News. \"It's a cheaper method for people who do want to get pregnant.\"\n\n Fitbits aren't the only wearables that can track fertility-related biometrics in the background. After a Kickstarter campaign, YONO just started shipping an earpiece designed to track your body temperature at rest. And Ava is working on a smart wristband that aims to help women conceive.\n\nHow an Activity Tracker Caught an Unexpected Pregnancy Fitness trackers, by nature of being worn around the clock, have the potential to capture unexpected insights about how your body works \u2014 and simplify laborious acts like manually figuring out your fertile days. That traditionally involves taking your temperature when your body is at rest, examining your cervical mucus, and recording this data every single day on a calendar. Clue\u2019s study, which ran for 13 months beginning in April 2015, didn\u2019t set out to see whether the Fitbit ChargeHR could identify when a woman becomes pregnant. Rather, it was exploring whether the device could reliably track an already-known occurrence: how a woman\u2019s resting heart rate changes when she\u2019s experiencing rising hormonal levels linked to ovulation. For the experiment, five women under 40 wore a Fitbit ChargeHR to bed. That\u2019s because resting heart rate data can be captured at its purest when a person is asleep and not moving. The women also logged their periods on Clue\u2019s app, and took daily urine tests to track when there was a surge in the key hormones that signaled they were entering ovulation. Researchers were watching all these biometrics as the study participants went through their cycles. A woman\u2019s \u201cfertile window\u201d \u2014 when she\u2019s likeliest to get pregnant \u2014 usually occurs two weeks after the start of her last period, and lasts for about six or seven days, ending on the day of ovulation.\n\nAs the researchers had hypothesized, the participants' Fitbits captured a portion of this fertile window by showing that their resting heart rates rose one or two days before ovulation, as well as during ovulation itself. So a woman who saw a bump in her resting heart rate history could use that information to schedule intercourse with her partner, H\u00f6gqvist Tabor said. And the study had one particularly unexpected outcome. Clue\u2019s marketing director, who was participating, was puzzled when her Fitbit said her heart rate was up by several beats per minute. H\u00f6gqvist Tabor said she soon realized what the finding meant, and broke the news to the marketing director: She was pregnant. The happy discovery was similar to one earlier this year, when a man posted on Reddit about how his wife\u2019s Fitbit showed an uptick in her resting heart rate. Upon a Redditor\u2019s suggestion, she took a test that confirmed she was in fact pregnant. An expert told BuzzFeed News at the time that her heart rate increase may have been an indirect result of elevated body temperature, another symptom of pregnancy. But Don't Think Of This As Birth Control Even though Clue\u2019s marketing director happened to find out she was pregnant from her Fitbit, the point of the study was to demonstrate that it's possible to use Fitbit as a conception tool, not as a pregnancy test, H\u00f6gqvist Tabor said. And that's provided that a couple doesn't have any other fertility-related problems.\n\nHowever, H\u00f6gqvist Tabor said, this information by itself should not be used as a birth control method. A woman will be fertile four to five days before her increased resting heart rate will start showing up on a Fitbit \u2014 so having unprotected intercourse during this period could in fact lead to an unintended pregnancy. If you\u2019re curious exactly what kind of increase in resting heart rate you should look out for, Clue hasn\u2019t revealed that information yet, but says it will publish that and other data in a paper later. (H\u00f6gqvist Tabor says it's tricky because it depends on the individual, and can range from a few beats per minute to 10 beats per minute.)\n\n One reason to potentially shy away from trusting Fitbit\u2019s heart-rate sensors: In a class-action lawsuit, some unhappy consumers have accused them of being inaccurate. Regardless, Clue scientists say that they were more interested in the devices\u2019 ability to capture the day-to-day differences in someone\u2019s resting heart rate, which seemed to be consistent, and less interested in whether the devices could produce the exact values of resting heart rate. \u201cYou will get a relative change, even though it might not be as accurate as a chest strap,\u201d said Clue co-founder Mike LaVigne.\n\nAnd while resting heart rate can be a tell-tale sign of ovulation, Lea von Bidder, CEO of Ava, says consumers shouldn\u2019t rely on that measurement alone if they\u2019re serious about getting pregnant. Her company's wristband is designed to track eight physiological markers in addition to heart rate variability, including skin temperature, pulse rate, breathing rate, and sleep.\n\n The Ava bracelet will launch this summer. As a low-risk medical device registered with the Food and Drug Administration, it doesn\u2019t need in-depth review by the agency to be sold, according to the company. By monitoring these multiple biomarkers while a woman is asleep, Ava\u2019s wearable and app can notify her during the five days she\u2019s most fertile, ending in ovulation, according to von Bidder, who says Ava has conducted studies on about 60 people. Von Bidder said it was promising to see that Fitbit might be able to provide heart rate data to women trying to conceive. \u201cBut we also know that heart rate alone will not be enough,\u201d she said. Wearables have a well-worn reputation as step-counting machines. But as Clue\u2019s and Ava\u2019s fertility research indicates, increasingly sophisticated sensors and algorithms could significantly open up wearables\u2019 capabilities \u2014 and make them that much more able to tackle bigger, complicated health issues.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Fitbits are widely available, though the story seems to take it for granted that readers will know this.

Paul Amminger of The University of Melbourne in Australia, a researcher on the study, told Reuters Health. But while psychiatrists now know how to identify these individuals, he added, they don\u2019t know what to do with them. \u201cAt the moment there\u2019s no state-of-the-art guideline (on) how to treat those people.\u201d\n\nPrescribing antipsychotic medications may be helpful, Amminger added, but these medications have serious side effects, and can also be stigmatizing. \u201cFor young people they don\u2019t want to commit themselves to a treatment which they might need to take for the next five to ten years,\u201d he said. Furthermore, only about a third of people at high risk for psychotic disorders will go on to develop full-fledged mental illness in a given year.\n\nThere\u2019s considerable evidence that abnormal fatty acid metabolism may contribute to the development of schizophrenia, Amminger and his team note in the Archives of General Psychiatry. To investigate whether omega-3 fatty acids might help prevent psychotic illness, they randomly assigned 81 at-risk individuals, 13 to 25 years old, to take 1.2 grams a day of omega-3s in fish oil capsule form or a placebo for 12 weeks and then followed them for another 40 weeks.\n\nThe researchers included people who met at least one of the following three criteria: having low-level psychotic symptoms; having transient psychotic symptoms; or having a schizophrenia-like personality disorder or a close relative with schizophrenia, along with a sharp decline in mental function within the past year.\n\nSeventy-six of the 81 study participants, or 94 percent, completed the trial, Amminger noted, which underscores the safety and tolerability of fish oil.\n\nAt one year, 5 percent of the study participants taking omega-3s had developed a psychotic disorder (2 of 41 people), compared to 28 percent of those on placebo (11 of 40). People taking fish oil also showed significant reductions in their psychotic symptoms and improvements in function, while they were at no greater risk of adverse effects than people taking placebo capsules.\n\nThe effect of fish oil capsules, Amminger noted, was similar to that seen in two trials of antipsychotic drugs in at-risk individuals.\n\nThere are a number of mechanisms through which omega-3s could protect the brain, Amminger said; they are a major component of brain cells. They are also key to the proper function of two brain chemical signaling systems, dopamine and serotonin, which have been implicated in schizophrenia. Fish oil also boosts levels of glutathione, an antioxidant that protects the brain against oxidative stress.\n\nTrials of medications for treating mental illness typically don\u2019t include people younger than 18, Amminger noted, while starting minors on these medications is \u201calways very difficult, and always quite controversial.\u201d\n\nBut if future research bears out the current findings, he added, fish oil promises to offer a safe way to help prevent psychosis in at-risk people, and could also potentially be used to prevent or delay the onset of chronic depression, bipolar illness, and substance abuse disorder \u2014 all of which are far more common than psychotic illness.\n\nHe and his colleagues are now planning a multicenter trial of fish oil for the prevention of psychotic illness in 320 at-risk people.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story does not state that\u00a0fish oil/omega-3\u00a0PUFA\u00a0supplements are widely available.

Medications and psychotherapy are the primary treatments. Many older adults prefer psychotherapy to medication for the treatment of anxiety. However, older adults who live in rural areas can face a number of barriers, including living in an area where psychotherapy is not available, so alternate methods of providing treatment could increase utilization, according to the study background.\n\nGretchen A. Brenes, Ph.D., of the Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, N.C., and coauthors compared telephone-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with telephone-delivered nondirective supportive therapy (NST) in a randomized clinical trial of 141 adults 60 or older with generalized anxiety disorder. The participants (70 were assigned to telephone CBT and 71 to telephone NST) were followed up at two months and four months.\n\nTelephone CBT consisted of up to 11 sessions (nine required) and focused on, among other things, anxiety symptom recognition, cognitive restructuring, relaxation, coping statements and problem solving. Telephone NST was 10 sessions where participants discussed their feelings but no direct suggestions for coping were provided.\n\nThe clinical trial demonstrated both treatments reduced symptoms of worry, depression and GAD, but telephone CBT was superior to telephone NST and resulted in a greater reduction of symptoms.\n\nAt four month\u2019s follow-up there was greater decline in worry severity among telephone CBT participants but no significant differences in general anxiety symptoms.

The data were presented today at the Society for Research on Nicotine & Tobacco's 22nd Annual Meeting.\n\nChrono's wearable transdermal drug delivery device times nicotine delivery to when smokers have their strongest cravings. For example, 75% of all smokers reach for their first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up. The Chrono Solution is designed to deliver the first dose of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) shortly before a smoker wakes up and then creates a pattern of \"peaks and troughs\" of nicotine delivery throughout the rest of the day to assure the smoker has more nicotine support when cravings are predicted to be strongest.\n\n\"In the United States, 70 percent of smokers want to quit, but quitting is extremely difficult. In fact, most people try 8 to 10 times and this includes quit attempts with standard cessation medications like nicotine patch and gum and prescription drugs like varenicline,\" said Alan Levy, Ph.D., chairman and CEO of Chrono Therapeutics. \"Gums and patches are designed to help manage cravings, but they are only 5 to 9 percent effective. Our goal is to solve this crisis of public health with an innovative, integrated smoking cessation solution, and the data we presented demonstrates that we are on the right path.\"\n\nThe clinical trial was a randomized, double blinded study of 24 adult males who smoked 11 or more cigarettes per day, indicating a high level of nicotine dependence. The subjects were divided into two groups. Test group subjects had nicotine administered over a 30-hour time period via Chrono's prototype device that delivered nicotine according to Chrono's \"peaks and troughs\" profile. Control subjects had a placebo solution, with no nicotine, administered at the same intervals via the same prototype device. Across both groups, subjects showed no serious adverse events or study withdrawals due to an adverse event. Skin irritation assessment showed no signs of irritation or erythema.\n\nCravings were assessed via three different methods: the Questionnaire for Smoking Urges (QSU), the Mood and Physical Symptoms Scale (MPSS) and a single craving question, each of which is a validated tool to assess cravings. When compared to subjects treated with placebo, test subjects had a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in cravings for all assessment methods (p=0.035; p=0.034 and p=0.016, respectively).\n\n\"Achieving statistical significance in a 24-subject trial is very striking and happens infrequently in biopharma; so these results are very encouraging,\" noted Wende Hutton, general partner at Canaan Partners and a member of Chrono's board of directors. \"Quitting smoking is one of the simplest ways to improve global public health, but as the dismal efficacy of current therapies demonstrates, it is also one of the hardest.

Those studies involved too few participants or produced conflicting results to draw any meaningful conclusions.\n\nSome of the studies included in the analysis even suggested that yoga might affect the body in ways similar to antidepressants and psychotherapy. For instance, yoga may influence brain chemicals known as neurotransmitters (boosting levels of feel-good agents like serotonin), lower inflammation, reduce oxidative stress and produce a healthier balance of lipids and growth factors \u2014 just as other forms of exercise do.\n\nEmbracing yoga as a complementary treatment for mental disorders is not uncommon. Yoga is a feature in many veterans\u2019 centers throughout the country, backed by research funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Huffington Post reported that many troops use yoga as a form of treatment for PTSD, for example, with companies like Warriors at Ease training instructors in yoga techniques specifically catered to those in the military. A study published earlier this month of 70 active-duty troops found daily yoga eased anxiety and improved sleep.\n\nThe researchers say there\u2019s enough evidence to warrant a larger study on the effects of yoga on mental health, and it should be considered as part of treatment for more disorders. \u201cMany millions of Americans are doing yoga and many millions of Americans have mental illnesses and are popping psychiatric pills daily. Despite all of this, the vast majority of studies looking at the benefits of yoga are all small studies. We did not come across a single study where there was a coordinated effort done by some large agency to really conduct a large national study,\u201d says Doraiswamy.\n\nBut while the research is promising, yoga likely won\u2019t be a panacea for mental illness. Nor should patients try to replace their medications with the practice. \u201cWhat we are saying is that we still need to do further, large-scale studies before we are ready to conclude that people with mental illnesses can turn to yoga as a first-line treatment,\u201d says Doraiswamy. \u201cWe are not saying throw away your Prozac and turn to yoga. We\u2019re saying it has the promise and potential. If a large national study were done, it could turn out that yoga is just as good and may be a low cost alternative to people with unmet needs.\u201d In the meantime, he says it doesn\u2019t hurt to add yoga to existing treatments so patients can take advantage of any potential benefits.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Yoga classes are widely available, but there is no standardized curriculum.

More than 10 million American adults have osteoporosis, and 80 percent of the people being treated for the condition nationwide are women, according to the Society's Endocrine Facts and Figures Report. Women are three times more likely to experience an osteoporosis-related bone fracture in their lifetimes than men.\n\n\"Our study is the largest and longest controlled study of growth hormone treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women to date,\" said one of the study's authors, Emily Krantz, MD, of S\u00f6dra \u00c4lvsborgs Hospital in Bor\u00e5s, Sweden. \"Years after treatment stopped, women who were treated with growth hormone still experienced improved bone density and reduced fracture risk.\"\n\nDuring an 18-month-long randomized, double-blind trial, 80 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis received daily injections of either placebo, a single unit of growth hormone or a 2.5-unit dose of growth hormone. The women were between the ages of 50 and 70 when they were recruited for the decade-long study.\n\nAfter 18 months, the women who received the placebo halted the injections. Women who received growth hormone continued to receive injections for another 18 months. The researchers continued to follow up with the women for seven years after the growth hormone treatment was halted to monitor their bone density, fractures and perception of their quality of life.\n\nThe researchers compared the participants' bone density and rate of fractures to those of a group of 120 women who did not have osteoporosis. The controls were identified using the city census in Gothenburg, Sweden.\n\nA decade after the study began, the women who received the larger growth hormone dose still had higher bone mineral density levels than the participants who received the lower dose or the placebo. The rate of fractures in the treated women who had osteoporosis declined by 50 percent during the 10-year-long study. More than half of the participants had fractured bones prior to the start of the study. In contrast, the rate of fractures rose four-fold in the control group as some of those women were diagnosed with osteoporosis.\n\n\"The findings indicate the beneficial effects of growth hormone remained long after the treatment ceased,\" Krantz said.\n\nOther authors of the study include: Penelope Trimpou and Kerstin Landin-Wilhelmsen of Sahlgrenska University Hospital at the University of Gothenburg in Gothenburg, Sweden.\n\nThe study, \"Effect of Growth Hormone Treatment on Fractures and Quality of Life in Osteoporosis - A 10-year Follow-up,\" was published online at http://press. , ahead of print.\n\nFounded in 1916, the Endocrine Society is the world's oldest, largest and most active organization devoted to research on hormones and the clinical practice of endocrinology.

The results will be presented in a poster presentation titled Lung EpiCheck \u2122 - Results of the Training and Test Sets of a Methylation-Based Blood Test for Early Detection of Lung Cancer at the IASLC 19th World Conference on Lung Cancer hosted by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, to take place on September 22-26, 2018 in Toronto, Canada.\n\nIn the study, blood was prospectively collected from 20 centers and 3 biobanks in Europe and Israel. The samples were used for detection of lung cancer with the Lung EpiCheck blood test. Lung EpiCheck was validated on this independent test set comprising 181 lung cancer cases and 141 current or former smoker controls. Results show specificity of 91% and a sensitivity of 74% with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 89%. These results demonstrated similar performance to the preceding training set results from 102 lung cancer cases and 265 current or former smoker controls.\n\nIn particular, in the non-small-cell lung carcinoma group (n=162), the most prevalent type of lung cancer affecting about 85% of lung cancer patients, Lung EpiCheck was able to identify correctly approximately 70% of patients. With a correct identification of 59% of stage I patients, 77% of stage II, 76% of stage III and 83% of stage IV patients.\n\nIn the small cell lung cancer group (n=13), Lung EpiCheck was able to identify correctly 92% of the patients, with a sensitivity of 100% in the limited stage, and 86% at the extensive stage.\n\n\"Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer worldwide due to the high incidence of the disease, and the low rate of diagnosis at early and more curable stages,\" stated Prof. Mina Gaga, the President of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and a lead investigator in the study. \"Clearly, we must establish screening programs for lung cancer worldwide. At the moment, low-dose computerized tomography (LDCT) screening which has been shown to reduce mortality from lung cancer in the very large NLST study is only reimbursed in the US for high-risk individuals. LDCT screening is not reimbursed in Europe or most areas in the world while there is still a debate about its cost and safety. Screening is however necessary in order to identify lung cancer at early, operable, stages for the entire at-risk population so currently, not only CT screening but also methods of molecular screening are being tested. I am therefore very encouraged with the results of this study, showing that EpiCheck has the ability to identify both non-small-cell and small-cell lung cancer at early stages, with a high level of sensitivity and specificity. Such promising results combined with the simplicity of the test, could allow us to detect lung cancer at the early stages and hence improve 5-year survival from about 15% to about 50-70%. This will offer significant added value in the fight against lung cancer.\"\n\n\"We are very excited to present the best published clinically validated results of a blood test for the early detection of lung cancer,\" said Opher Shapira, PhD, CEO of Nucleix. \"Furthermore, these results were validated prospectively in an independent cohort. Currently, early stage lung cancer can be detected either accidentally, when testing for other conditions, or by using low-dose CT scans, which are costly, carry associated risks such as high radiation, and are employed only for a very high-risk population. Early detection of lung cancer can be a game-changer in the fight against this devastating disease, and we are looking forward to begin extensive clinical trials in the US, Europe and China next year, in order to get the test to the market as soon as possible at an affordable price.\"\n\nThe Lung EpiCheck blood test is based on a proprietary molecular biomarker technology, which combines new biochemical assays and sophisticated algorithms. The technology is based on identification and analysis of subtle changes in DNA methylation patterns, a powerful tool for distinguishing between cancer and healthy cells and thus for detection of tumors in the body. Dying tumor cells release cell-free DNA (cfDNA) into the blood, where cancer-specific methylation changes can be detected at any disease stage. The Lung EpiCheck blood test detects changes in DNA methylation in 6 markers in cfDNA associated with lung cancer.\n\nLung cancer is the deadliest and most common of all cancer types. It is estimated that there are about 1.8 million new cases of lung cancer annually worldwide and about 1.55 million die from the disease each year. The reason for the high mortality rate is that currently most cases are detected when the patient becomes symptomatic, which is usually at late stages of the disease. To date, there is no adequate screening process for the early detection of lung cancer, bringing 5-year survival rate to approximately 15%. In addition, there is a well-defined risk group for developing the disease \u2013 mostly smokers and former smokers above the age of 50. In the US, low-dose CT is available for screening of individuals 55-79 years old who smoked at least 1 pack a day for 30 years, which represent less than half of the lung cancer population. Therefore, a screening test aimed at the entire risk group to assist in the early detection of the disease is highly needed and can dramatically increase lung cancer survival.\n\nNucleix Ltd. develops, manufactures and markets innovative, non-invasive, molecular cancer diagnostic tests.

The Oncotype DX DCIS Score result provides patients with an individualized estimate of local (in the same breast) recurrence, which could be either invasive breast cancer or DCIS. This information helps physicians and patients personalize treatment decisions to potentially spare women with low risk of recurrence additional treatment they may not need, while identifying women with a higher risk of recurrence who may need additional treatment after surgery.\n\nConducted in collaboration with Partnership for Health Analytic Research, this prospective study analyzed 115 patients from 10 cancer centers in the United States. The results showed that physician treatment recommendations changed for 31 percent of patients after receiving the DCIS Score result, reducing the number of patients receiving a radiotherapy recommendation by approximately one-third. Importantly, of the patients initially recommended not to receive radiotherapy, 32 percent were identified as having a high risk of recurrence and recommended to have radiotherapy. Physicians in this study rated the DCIS Score as the most important factor in planning treatment compared with pathologic features, patient preference, patient age, comorbidities or consultation with other physicians.\n\n\"The Oncotype DX DCIS Score result was validated in two studies including nearly 900 patients and is the only genomic test for patients with pre-invasive breast cancer,\" said Phil Febbo, M.D., chief medical officer, Genomic Health. \"The publication of this clinical utility study clearly demonstrates that the Oncotype DX DCIS Score can play a key role in enhancing cancer care for patients with DCIS, and we believe that these results will support expanded adoption of and access to the DCIS Score.\"\n\nAbout Oncotype DX\u00ae\n\nThe Oncotype DX\u00ae portfolio of breast, colon and prostate cancer tests applies advanced genomic science to reveal the unique biology of a tumor in order to optimize cancer treatment decisions.

Using this technology is still seen as a stopgap, however, while a biological solution to diabetes is sought.\n\n\"We have pioneered the development of a closed-loop artificial pancreas because we believe it will significantly impact the lives of individuals with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, by providing exquisite control of blood sugar,\" Dr. Richard A. Insel, executive vice president for research at the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF), said during a noon teleconference Saturday.\n\nA symposium on advances in the technology -- co-sponsored by the American Diabetes Association and the JDRF -- is slated for Sunday as part of the American Diabetes Association's annual meeting, in Orlando, Fla.\n\nFor people with type 1 diabetes, controlling their blood sugar levels is a full-time job. Too much insulin can cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), which can be life-threatening, while too little causes the serious damage of diabetes such as kidney, vision and circulation problems.\n\n\"The promise in the near term of these technologies is not only to help us reduce significantly the risk of long-term diabetic complications, but also to reduce the risk of having a catastrophic hypoglycemic event, and further help people with diabetes live easier,\" Aaron Kowalski, research director of the JDRF's Artificial Pancreas Project, said during the teleconference.\n\n\"This will help keep people healthy while we drive toward a biological approach, which will take longer,\" he said.\n\nIn the first report, Dr. Roman Hovorka, a principal research associate in the department of pediatrics at the University of Cambridge, reported that the technology can significantly improve overnight blood sugar control in adults without the fear of developing hypoglycemia. With the technology, patients maintained their blood sugar levels within the target range for 70 percent of the time, compared to 47 percent of the time among those not using the technology.\n\nMoreover, glucose control was demonstrated in real-life situations such as after a large meal and having a glass of white wine.\n\n\"We let them consume about three-quarters of a bottle of wine to simulate what happens after a large meal,\" Hovorka said during Saturday's teleconference. \"What has been shown is that drinking alcohol in the evening causes hypoglycemia early in the morning.\"\n\nThese results were similar to findings in children where the system extended the amount of time spent at target blood sugar levels, he added. \"We reduced hypoglycemia by half,\" he said.\n\n\"Our plan is to move into home studies, which hopefully will happen later on this year,\" Hovorka said.\n\nMeanwhile, Marilyn Ritholz, a senior psychologist at the Joslin Diabetes Center and an assistant professor of psychology at the Harvard Medical School, reported on a study on psychological barriers to continuous blood sugar monitoring.\n\n\"So far, studies have not shown which factors predict which factors are associated with successful or unsuccessful continuous glucose monitoring [CGM],\" she said during the teleconference.\n\nRitholz's team found that people who were better at coping with the frustration of using the device were more successful at keeping their blood sugar under control.\n\nFrustrations included warning alarms and problems at the insertion point of the device. \"We found that the people who did well used a more problem-solving approach and persisted in trying to learn how to use the CGM,\" she said.\n\nPeople who were not successful used \"emotion-based coping,\" Ritholz said. \"They easily became overwhelmed and they just gave up.\"\n\nIn addition, successful people had more involvement and support from their spouse or \"significant other,\" she added. All patients felt self-conscious wearing the device, Ritholz noted.\n\n\"We know that CGM success or failure is as dependent on the human experience as it is on the perfection of the technology,\" she said.\n\nSpeaking at the Saturday teleconference, Dr. William Tamborlane, chief of pediatric endocrinology at Yale University School of Medicine and co-chair of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's Continuous Glucose Monitoring Group, said the system only works if worn almost every day.\n\nStudies have shown that children and adults over 25 who used CGM were able to reduce their blood sugar levels. However, teenagers did not see a benefit, probably because they were less likely to wear the device, Tamborlane said.\n\nPeople who used the device more than six days per week saw improvement, regardless of age, he added.\n\nTo get more people to use CGM, \"the industry needs to come up with better systems and better devices,\" he said.\n\nArtificial pancreas technology combines CGM with an insulin pump and a sophisticated computer program that controls when and how much insulin to deliver.\n\nThe device delivers two hormones that are deficient in type 1 diabetes -- insulin, which keeps blood sugar levels from going too high after a meal, and glucagon, a naturally occurring hormone that prevents blood sugar levels from dropping too low.\n\nHowever, the complicated computer algorithm for the pump system is still being developed.\n\nFor more information on type 1 diabetes, visit the American Diabetes Association.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "One the one hand, the article tells us that the technology is emerging, the algorithm is still being developed, and the whole approach is still being researched in future studies.

What\u2019s missing is at least some emphasis, ideally early, that this research is quite experimental at this point, with some discussion of the steps between this small study and the technology potentially going to market.\nThe article also takes until the third to last paragraph, after the discussion of the Ritholz study, to explain what an \"artificial pancreas\" actually is; burying that explanation and leading with an illustration of a real human pancreas does nothing but suggest to lay readers that an \"artificial pancreas\" is something like a prosthetic organ, instead of a computer link between extant devices. It could\u2019ve been clearer about how the \"closed loop\" technology is supposed to improve on the available devices. In fact, we\u2019re not sure that the description of the artificial pancreas as a single discrete \"device\" matches what was used in the study, which, according to the abstract, seems to have involved a glucose monitor, a computer, and a human being making adjustments to the patient\u2019s insulin pump.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "It\u2019s easy to get into the habit of popping a pill to have a good night\u2019s sleep.

Among other things, breast milk contains natural sources of prebiotics: small, indigestible fiber molecules that promote the growth of good bacteria in the baby's gut. Yet for many families, breastfeeding is difficult or impossible. Fortunately, modern infant formulas are getting closer to the real thing with the help of University of Illinois researchers.\n\nIn a recent study from the Piglet Nutrition and Cognition Lab at U of I, scientists worked with piglets to show prebiotics included in infant formula can enhance memory and exploratory behavior.\n\n\"When we provide prebiotics in formula, our results confirm that we can not only benefit gut health, which is known, but we can also influence brain development,\" says Ryan Dilger, associate professor in the Department of Animal Sciences, Division of Nutritional Sciences, and Neuroscience Program at U of I. \"We can actually change the way piglets learn and remember by influencing bacteria in the colon.\"\n\nPiglets are widely considered a more informative model for human infants than mice and rats; their digestive systems, behavioral responses, and brain development are remarkably similar to human infants. Therefore, researchers are increasingly turning to piglets to test hypotheses in pre-clinical trials related to human health, especially in the context of gut microbes and brain development.\n\n\"There hasn't been a lot of work looking at the gut-brain axis in humans, but a lot of rodent work is showing those connections. This is taking it to an animal model that is a lot closer to human infants and asking if that connection still exists and if we can tease out possible mechanisms,\" says Stephen Fleming, lead author of the study and a doctoral student in the Neuroscience Program at U of I.\n\nIn early 2016, Dilger and his colleagues worked with piglets to show that a combination of innovative formula components, including prebiotics, may play a role in brain development and behavior. In their new study, the team concentrated solely on the effects of prebiotics.\n\nStarting on the second day of life, piglets were given a cow's milk-based infant formula supplemented with polydextrose (PDX), a synthetic carbohydrate with prebiotic activity, and galactooligosaccharide (GOS), a naturally occurring prebiotic. When the piglets were 25 days old, Fleming took them through several learning, memory, and stress tests. After 33 days, blood, brain, and intestinal tissues were collected for analysis.\n\nThe test for learning and memory gave piglets a chance to play with dog toys: one they'd seen before and one brand-new toy. If they spent more time with the new toy, that was an indication that the piglet recognized it as new and preferred it. This \"novel object recognition\" test improves on classic maze tests commonly used in rodent studies.\n\n\"If you're trying to test for memory, this test is closer to what we'd do with an infant. After all, we don't generally train infants on mazes,\" Fleming says. \"We know from previous research this test works for pigs, but this is the first published example of using it in a nutrition context.\"\n\nPigs fed PDX and GOS spent more time playing with new objects than pigs who didn't receive the prebiotic supplements. The preference for novel objects, an indication of natural curiosity, is a sign of healthy brain development and points towards positive development of learning and memory.\n\nWhen prebiotics are working the way they should, good bacteria increase in abundance. One way to tell is by looking at metabolic end-products - volatile fatty acids (VFAs) - excreted by bacteria during digestion of prebiotic fibers.\n\n\"Volatile fatty acids are a global indicator for whether prebiotics had an effect on the overall population of bacteria. For example, we might want to see an increase in Lactobacillus and other beneficial bacteria that produce butyrate,\" Dilger explains. Volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations in the colon, blood, and brain were changed in pigs receiving PDX and GOS compared with control pigs.\n\nRecent evidence suggests that bacterial VFAs could be getting into the blood and traveling to the brain, where they could potentially affect mood and behavior.\n\n\"We found that, yes, VFAs are absorbed in the blood of pigs that were fed PDX/GOS. And, yes, they do get into the brain,\" Fleming explains. \"But when we looked at the relationship between these VFAs and the results of our behavior tests, there did not appear to be a clear connection.\"\n\nAnother surprise was a decrease in serotonin in brains of pigs fed the prebiotic. \"When you hear less serotonin, there's an immediate reaction to say, 'Well, that's bad,'\" Fleming says. Not necessarily; those pigs didn't show greater anxiety than control pigs during a stress test or poorer performance when given a learning and memory test. The researchers hypothesize that the prebiotics may alter levels of tryptophan, serotonin's amino acid precursor, but it's too early to say.\n\nAlthough more work is needed to tackle remaining questions, the study adds to the growing body of research suggesting a strong and potentially modifiable link between the gut and the brain: a link that makers of infant formula should strongly consider.\n\n\"There are so many ways we can alter the composition of the microbiota and they can have very strong benefits. Promoting good 'gut health' remains a strong focus in the field of nutrition,\" Dilger says.\n\nThe article, \"Dietary polydextrose and galactooligosaccharide increase exploratory behavior, improve recognition memory, and alter neurochemistry in the young pig,\" is published in Nutritional Neuroscience.

The new vaccine offers significantly greater protection than the current vaccine, which protects against only two cancer causing types of HPV.\n\nA pivotal international clinical trial compared the safety and efficacy of the new vaccine, Gardasil 9, with the current vaccine, Gardasil, in more than 14,200 women aged between 16 and 26 years old. The findings indicate that if uninfected populations are vaccinated with Gardasil 9, approximately 90 per cent of all cervical cancers worldwide could be prevented.\n\nPublished in the New England Journal of Medicine, the study found that, among uninfected women, Gardasil 9 was 97 per cent effective at preventing high-grade cervical, vulvar and vaginal disease caused by HPV 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58, and was equally effective as the current Gardasil vaccine in preventing diseases caused by HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18.\n\nProfessor Jack Cuzick of Queen Mary University of London, who co-authored the report and participated in the design and analysis of the study, and served on the Trial Advisory Board, comments: \"This is a significant achievement. The new vaccine, Gardasil 9, is not only safe but will offer greatly improved protection against cervical and other cancers. Eventually this will mean less screening is needed, as women will have greater protection from the outset.\n\n\"Gardasil 9 offers the potential to increase overall cervical cancer prevention from 70 to 90 per cent, nearly eliminating this cancer among vaccinated women. However, it's crucial to remember that vaccination must be done before exposure to the virus. Our focus for prevention must be on girls aged 12-13, as the current UK vaccine programme is doing, but the vaccine may also be appropriate for women 25-45 as part of a screening appointment.\"\n\nUntil late last year, there were two available vaccines to protect against HPV related disease (Cervarix and Gardasil). The UK currently uses Gardasil which protects against four HPV types and offers about 70 per cent protection against cervical cancer, and also significantly reduces the risk of other types of cancer and genital warts.\n\nHowever, researchers have been trying to find methods to completely eliminate cervical cancer and other HPV related disease and by adding five more cancer related HPV types. The development of the new Gardasil 9 vaccine makes an important step in that direction.\n\nHPV is the most common sexually transmitted virus. Many people infected with HPV clear it from their systems with no lasting health concerns and some types of the virus are low risk, causing warts or verrucas. However, other types are high risk, causing cervical cancer (and less commonly vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, and throat cancers). Almost all cases of cervical cancer occur as a result of infection with high risk types of HPV.\n\nCervical cancer is still the fourth most common cancer in women, with over 500,000 cases and 250,000 deaths per year worldwide. In the UK around 3,000 women a year are diagnosed with cervical cancer and in 2011 there were around 970 deaths.\n\nIn the UK, all girls aged 12 to 13 are offered HPV vaccination as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme.\n\nProfessor Jack Cuzick concludes: \"Following these important findings, this vaccine has been licenced in the USA and approval is currently being sought in the UK and other countries.

HER2 has been established as a therapeutic target in breast cancer, and breast cancers in which the HER2 gene is not amplified do not, in general, respond to HER2-directed therapeutic approaches.\n\nA few years ago, when the research teams of Dr. Matthew Ellis and others carried out a molecular characterization of breast cancer tumors, they found a new mutation in HER2 that was different from gene amplification but also resulted in tyrosine kinase being constantly activated.\n\n\"In this particular activation mechanism, the cells develop a subtle mutation within the functional part of the HER2 gene that activates the enzyme,\" said Ellis, professor and director of the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center, part of the National Cancer Institute-designated Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center at Baylor College of Medicine. \"The mutation locks the enzyme into an 'on' position.\"\n\nEllis and his colleagues developed a preclinical model to study this new HER2 mutation and discovered that the enhanced enzymatic activity could trigger tumor formation. Furthermore, these tumor cells were sensitive to an experimental drug, neratinib. With this information in hand, the researchers took the next step.\n\n\"We launched a phase II clinical trial of neratinib in patients with metastatic breast cancer carrying a HER2 mutation,\" Ellis said. \"Finding patients that are positive for a HER2 mutation required a national collaboration because we had to screen hundreds of patients to identify the 2 to 3 percent that have a tumor driven by a HER2 mutation. The results of the clinical trial were encouraging in that about 30 percent of the 16 patients treated with neratinib had a meaningful clinical response showing significant disease stabilization or regression. Neratinib was well tolerated by most patients.\"\n\n\"This is the first time we had a reasonable number of patients treated for HER2 mutations in whom we could estimate the response rate.\"\n\nThe number of patients who could potentially benefit from this new treatment approach is estimated to be in the thousands. The researchers estimate that as many as 200,000 patients are likely to be living with metastatic breast cancer today in the United States. Based on the estimate that the new mutation is present in 2 to 3 percent of cases, the researchers calculated that approximately 4,000 to 6,000 patients with metastatic breast cancer carry a HER2 mutation and are therefore potential candidates for neratinib treatment.\n\nTo identify the patients in this study who carried the new HER2 mutation, the researchers required tissue from the tumor, a biopsy, from which they could extract and sequence the genetic material to determine the presence of the HER2 mutation. This task turned out to be a major challenge because for 20 to 30 percent of the patients the researchers did not have sufficient material to make the diagnosis.\n\n\"To assist in our ability to identify patients with HER2 mutation-positive tumors, we conducted circulating tumor DNA analysis,\" Ellis said. \"The tumor's DNA is released into the human bloodstream, and we were able to determine the presence of the mutation in blood samples from the patients. Importantly the circulating tumor DNA results were highly concordant with the tumor sequencing results, and they were much easier to determine. Notably, the blood test was sensitive enough that we could use it as a tool to determine eligibility for the clinical trial.\"\n\nIn addition to bringing to the table a novel treatment for metastatic breast cancer carrying a HER2 mutation, the researchers have tested the value of the circulating tumor DNA as a disease-monitoring marker.\n\n\"A circulating tumor DNA-based blood test also could therefore be potentially used to monitor tumor progression and to determine whether patients are responding or not to treatment after just one month of therapy,\" Ellis said.\n\nEllis also is a McNair Scholar at Baylor.\n\nRead all the details of this study, the full list of contributors and their financial support in Clinical Cancer Research.", "question": "Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The release didn\u2019t make it clear that more research is needed following the phase 2 trial.

Her mother knew she had a gifted child, but those gifts would not come without challenges.\n\n\u201cI think I knew from very early on that she was different, but she was my first child, so I figured anything that I saw, there was a chance that she would grow out of it,\u201d Amy Oakes told FoxNews.com. \u201cShe would wake up in the middle of the night with night terrors at a very young age, she stopped napping around 15 months \u2026 any type of change in our schedule could set off an epic tantrum.\u201d\n\nOakes didn\u2019t know it then, but her daughter Mallory was one of more than 10 percent of American children living with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\n\n\u201cShe was diagnosed in first grade after there were some difficulties in the classroom,\u201d Amy said. \u201cBut there were other components to it -- there was oppositional defiant disorder, there were some [autism] spectrum-like behaviors, and difficulty later on socializing with other children.\u201d\n\nOppositional defiant disorder is one of the most common conditions linked to ADHD in children and is characterized by anger, tantrums, opposition to authority and, sometimes, aggressive behavior.\n\nFor Mallory, the disorder led to a pattern of epic meltdowns which left Amy reeling\u2014 and willing to try anything to control them.\n\n\u201cInitially, I tried a number of different things -- different kinds of therapies; art therapies. I took her to somebody who supposedly could heal through touch,\u201d she said. \u201cWe tried some medication therapies that ended up being really a nightmare for us, and making matters worse.\u201d\n\nMedication is often the first line of defense in conventional medicine for kids with ADD and ADHD, with doctors prescribing everything from stimulants to antipsychotics and even antidepressants to help control the symptoms. The spectrum of ADHD and related disorders is broad, and there is no one-size-fits-all treatment.\n\n\u201cThere were times I remember saying to my husband that her behaviors are holding our family hostage because it could be one meltdown a day, it could be five meltdowns a day,\u201d Amy said. \u201cShe couldn't do anything to stop it, and I really began to realize that her brain wouldn't let her, even if she wanted to be good, her brain wasn't allowing her to.\u201d\n\nMallory\u2019s oppositional behavior reached a fever pitch when the family moved from their home in Hoboken, N.J. to the suburb of Glen Rock, N.J. in 2014.\n\n\u201cShe wasn't able to attend mainstream school anymore and the school that we ended up putting her in was an end-of-the-road school \u2026 in my mind, it was not a place where she belonged,\u201d Amy said.\n\nDesperate for a solution, Amy started searching for success stories about kids like Mallory who had been helped by different therapies. That\u2019s when she found the Brain Balance Achievement Center in Allendale, N.J.\n\n\u201cWe went in for the assessment and her behaviors at the assessment were really terrible,\u201d Amy said. \u201cI thought we weren't going to get accepted to the program, and they told us they could help us and we never looked back.\u201d\n\nThe specialized learning centers, of which there are now 80 throughout the country, were developed by Dr. Robert Melillo, a neurology researcher and author of the book \u201cDisconnected Kids,\u201d to help balance the brains of kids with learning disorders, like Mallory.\n\n\u201cWhat thinking really is is really coordinating different networks in the brain so that we can bring all of those networks together at one time,\u201d Melillo told FoxNews.com. \u201cAnd if [kids] have poor coordination in their body, they often have poor coordination in their brain -- poor coordination between their networks -- so they can't bring all these networks together to learn in the most optimal way.\u201d\n\nThe program uses a combination of sensory motor (physical) exercises and academic learning to help stimulate and strengthen the parts of the brain responsible for certain disorders.\n\n\u201cIf you get a child who has really strong left brain and delayed right brain, those are kids that may be labeled with attentional problems or behavioral problems or social issues,\u201d Melillo said. \u201cThe easiest way to get their brain to become coordinated is by making their body coordinated, so a large part of what we're doing is this sensory motor interaction, building their muscle tone, building their strength, building their body spatial awareness.\u201d\n\nThe program also incorporates what Melillo calls \u201cbionutritional\u201d guidelines to make sure children are getting the proper nutrition for optimal learning. Parents are a big part of the learning experience and are tasked with at-home exercises to do with their kids.\n\nMallory attended the Brain Balance Achievement Center three times a week after school for three months at a time, starting in November 2014.

The rest of us want to know how much we have to exercise to see health benefits. Now we have some answers: You may want to go just a tad longer and harder than you'd thought.\n\nCurrent government guidelines advise adults to get the equivalent of at least 2 1/2 hours of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of higher-intensity exercise every week, plus some strength training. In effect, those guidelines say there's no particular benefit from working out harder, other than saving time.\n\nTo find out if that's true, researchers at Queen's University in Ontario studied different combinations of exercise intensity and duration in a group of 300 sedentary adults with abdominal obesity. (That's generally defined as a waist circumference of more than 35 inches for women who aren't pregnant and more than 40 inches for men.) People with abdominal obesity are at higher risk of heart disease and early death than people with slimmer waistlines.\n\nAll the exercisers were told to work out under supervision five times per week for 24 weeks. One group worked out at low intensity, about 50 percent of maximum oxygen uptake (VO max, a measure of cardiovascular fitness), for about 31 minutes per session \u2014 enough to burn 180 calories for women and 300 for men. That exercise prescription was about the same as in the government guidelines. The intensity was about equivalent to walking slowly, said study author Robert Ross, a kinesiologist at Queen's University.\n\nAnother group exercised at the same low intensity but almost twice as long \u2014 about 58 minutes on average, or five hours a week, until the women had burned 360 calories and the men 600.\n\nAnd a third group exercised at a higher but still moderate intensity, 75 percent of VO max, until they'd burned the same number of calories as the second group. That took about 40 minutes a day, or 3.3 hours a week. That intensity was equivalent to brisk walking for the previously sedentary participants, Ross told Shots. (Note that we're not talking about the all-out sprints of high-intensity interval training.)\n\nA fourth group was told to do no exercise.\n\nAll the participants were told to keep a food diary and to eat a healthful diet but to keep their calorie intake constant. They also wore accelerometers to track their physical activity during the rest of the day, to make sure the more intense exercisers weren't compensating with more time on the sofa.\n\nAt the end of the study, members of all three exercise groups lost an average of about 2 inches from their waist circumference. There weren't differences between the three groups. The average exerciser also lost 5 to 6 percent of body weight.\n\n\"The take-home message here is that if you're consuming a healthful diet and engaging with exercise consistent with the guidelines, you're going to see a benefit in your waistline and on the bathroom scale,\" said Ross. The results were published Monday in Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nBut there was also a benefit from going just a bit faster: Only participants in the higher-intensity group saw an improvement in glucose tolerance, a risk factor for heart disease. (It's unclear whether the 9 percent improvement seen will be enough to cut their risk of heart disease, though.)\n\nThe result makes sense, since there's some previous evidence suggesting that higher-intensity exercise is tied to improving how the body processes sugar, said Neal Pire, an exercise physiologist who puts together medically based training programs at HNH Fitness in Oradell, N.J., a program of Holy Name Medical Center. Strength training can also improve glucose tolerance, which is why it's part of the government guidelines, he told Shots.\n\nCardiovascular fitness also improved in all three groups, but the lower-intensity exercisers who went longer did better than those who went shorter, and the higher-intensity group did better still.\n\nBottom line: All the exercisers improved, but the folks who did the best walked briskly for about 40 minutes five times a week. (Ross suggests you walk as if you're late for a bus.) \"It doesn't take a lot,\" said Ross. \"That's why our participants were so surprised. They didn't have to climb Mount Everest.\"", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Walking and other forms of exercise are widely available for most.

I was taken aback by their response. They basically laughed at the idea that the flu shot was particularly effective.\n\nThis posed a conundrum. It seemed like there were two groups saying very different things. But after reviewing the research, I think I understand what's going on here. It's true that flu vaccines don't work spectacularly well, at least according to the best evidence we have (and most of the evidence on flu vaccines is of poor methodological quality). But the downsides to getting a vaccine are extremely minimal, and flu shots may still be helpful in reducing some illness and saving lives, which is why public health experts say you should get vaccinated anyway.\n\nWhy the flu vaccine isn't always effective\n\nThe flu vaccine has been our main strategy for warding off seasonal flu for more than 60 years. Seasonal influenza, which surfaces as a respiratory illness, is caused by influenza A and B viruses. The flu shot is designed to protect people against three or four strains of the A and B viruses that researchers believe will be most common that year, leading to the nasty fevers, headaches, coughs, and runny noses that make many people miserable in the fall and winter.\n\nThe challenge, however, is that the flu virus is highly unstable, mutating all the time. So this means drug companies can't just make one kind of vaccine that'll last a lifetime. Every year, public health agencies essentially make educated guesses on what strains and mutations will make the rounds. And that's not easy. In February, the World Health Organization offers a prediction \u2014 based on surveillance and laboratory and clinical studies \u2014 and then each country uses that prediction to approve vaccines in its jurisdiction. (In the US, the Food and Drug Administration makes that final call.) The potential for error here can dramatically alter the effectiveness of the flu shot in a given season. If vaccine makers prepare for one combination of viruses and different ones end up circulating widely, the vaccine won't work that well.\n\nThis may help explain why the evidence on the effectiveness of flu shots is relatively mixed. The Cochrane Collaboration, an independent nonprofit that reviews the evidence on medical questions, has conducted two major meta-analyses (looking at the results of lots of individual studies) on whether the shot prevents flu in healthy children and adults.\n\nIn kids, the highest-quality evidence \u2014 a randomized controlled trial \u2014 suggests the vaccine works well enough: On average, if you give six kids under the age of 6 a flu shot, you can expect to prevent one case of the flu. For children under age 2, the benefits are less clear; the evidence, the researchers found, was scant, and of the research that was available, it seemed the efficacy of the shot was similar to placebo.\n\nIn adults, however, the vaccine's effects are more modest. \"Depending on the season,\" explained Tom Jefferson, an author on these Cochrane reviews, \"you need to vaccinate anywhere between 33 and 100 people to avoid one set of symptoms.\" In a good year, when the WHO guesses correctly and the flu shot matches the strains in circulation, you need to give 33 adults flu shots, on average, to prevent one case of illness. In a year when the WHO guesses badly, you need to vaccinate 100 people to prevent one flu case.\n\nJefferson pointed out that his Cochrane review on adults also found that flu vaccination rates have barely any effect on the number of sick days taken and no major impact on rates of hospitalization. So, yes, the flu vaccine can prevent illness, but it's hard to detect major effects on public health in the data.\n\nOn the other hand, the evidence suggests that there's no harm in getting a flu shot, either. The meta-analyses found no evidence of serious side effects beyond the odd case of soreness at the injection site.\n\nThat seems to be the same conclusion that other studies have drawn \u2014 the flu vaccine is modestly helpful, and doesn't hurt. In 2012 researchers analyzed 15 meta-analyses on the flu shot and concluded, \"Most influenza vaccines have been shown to confer some protection against naturally acquired infection and no evidence for major harms has emerged.\"\n\nOne key caveat here is that the evidence, overall, is pretty poor quality. Most of these analyses rely overwhelmingly on observational studies, where researchers observe and gather data on people who take the flu shot compared with those who don't. Because these aren't experiments \u2014 ideally we'd have randomized controlled trials \u2014 they're more prone to bias and therefore less reliable.\n\nIn the case of the elderly, the situation is particularly troublesome. As this Lancet study points out, because annual flu shots were recommended for the elderly since the 1960s, it has been unethical to conduct high-quality randomized controlled trials where you give only one group the shot in order to compare it with another group that didn't get the vaccine. So, as this Cochrane review notes, it's impossible to draw firm conclusions on the effectiveness of the flu vaccine for those over 65 because the data is so biased and poor.\n\nAgain, though, this doesn't mean we should throw away the vaccine. Stanford researcher John Ioannidis told me how he makes sense of this issue after reviewing the evidence: \"Overall the flu vaccine is effective, and it does save lives. I cannot put an exact figure to how many, but it may well be millions of lives. Generally it is safe and rather cheap, so even if the effectiveness is less than optimal sometimes, overall it is a good deal.\"\n\nWhy people still bother to get the shot\n\nDespite the limited evidence of effectiveness, there are still good reasons why public health experts recommend the shot.\n\nFor one, in those years when the WHO guesses correctly which strains will circulate, the shot tends to be a lot more helpful than some of these averages suggest. And the vaccine is overwhelmingly safe. There's also little by way of alternatives. Beyond public health measures (making sure you have good hand hygiene and avoiding the office when you're sick), the flu shot is the best medical intervention we have for preventing infection. So there's little downside with at least some potential benefit. I personally continue to get the flu shot for this reason.\n\nAs Roger Baxter, the co-director of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center, told me, \"Flu vaccines are not a panacea, and do not prevent all cases of flu, even in the best years, when there are no manufacturing problems and the match is perfect.\" He continued: \"However, the vaccines provide moderate protection, and can prevent huge numbers of cases of this serious illness. Many studies have shown that the vaccines are very safe, so the benefit-to-risk ratio is high and the cost is relatively low.\"\n\nWelcome to Dear Julia, a column where readers can submit everyday health questions.

Surgeons replace the raw bone ends with smooth, artificial surfaces that restore at least some of the joint's normal function. They anchor these prosthetics to the remaining bone with screws and cement.\n\nWrist replacement is much more complicated than hip and knee replacement. More than a dozen bones lie beneath the skin and muscles of the hand and wrist, compared with two or three for those larger joints. The wrist procedure replaces some of the small carpal bones altogether and sends as many as three screws into the hand.\n\n\"Our hand is our working instrument,\" said Dr. Evan D. Collins, an orthopedic surgeon with the Methodist Center for Sports Medicine. \"It twists on all planes, it goes up, down, sideways and it rotates.\"\n\nSome form of wrist replacement surgery has been available but seldom used for decades. More commonly, surgeons perform fusion procedures that relieve pain but immobilize the wrist. Replacement, by contrast, preserves some range of motion.\n\n\"The cost is that you don't have the ability to lift heavy objects,\" Collins said. \"What you trade against that is range of motion.\"\n\nAfter replacement surgery and months of physical therapy, patients can lift no more than 15 or 20 pounds, he said.\n\nOlder prosthetics used in wrist replacement required removing significant amounts of bone, which made later fusion problematic if the surgery failed, Collins explained.\n\n\"Some of the newer implant designs save a lot of the bone stock,\" said Collins, who performs about 10 wrist replacements a year. \"If it does fail, revising it may not as difficult as it has been in the past.\"\n\nFusion may remain more appropriate for some people with very active lifestyles or jobs that require lifting heavy objects or using bone-jarring tools.\n\nUnder low-wear conditions, doctors expect joint prosthetics to last 10 to 15 years, another reason replacement might not be considered for younger people.\n\nPotential patients must be evaluated for other causes of pain, Collins noted, because problems with thumbs or other hand parts can make the wrist hurt. Occasionally, other conditions must be addressed in addition to joint damage. Collins performed a carpal tunnel procedure while replacing Chambers' wrist joint, but he said such combination surgery isn't common.\n\nChambers spent two nights in the hospital after her operation in April.\n\nShe wore a cast for two months, a splint for another two and continued physical therapy through July.\n\nShe still can't lift more than 11 pounds, but the pain has greatly subsided.\n\n\"It's just about gone.

The painkiller's anti-inflammatory properties and effects in damping down precancerous polyps may be involved.\n\nAnd the latest study, published in The Lancet, suggests aspirin could provide protection against a wide variety of tumors. They range from pancreatic cancer to the type of lung cancer that strikes nonsmokers.\n\nFor some of these cancers, the reduction in death was remarkable. Twenty years after people had started taking aspirin regularly (and kept it up for at least five years), their deaths from esophageal cancer were reduced by 60 percent compared to study subjects who got a placebo.\n\nDeaths from adenomatous lung cancer were cut 30 percent, those from colorectal cancer 40 percent, and those from prostate cancer 10 percent.\n\nStill, none of the big guns in cancer and prevention -- the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, or the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force -- are ready to advise healthy people to start taking aspirin to prevent cancer.\n\nBut the latest batch of evidence deserves a closer look. It encompasses eight earlier studies that compared cancer deaths among more than 25,000 people randomly assigned to get aspirin (of different doses) or placebo. And the researchers were able to gather more information about cancer deaths for up to 20 years after those studies ended about nearly 13,000 people.\n\nFor cancer prevention experts, the British study is provocative and significant. \"This is definitely the first time that research has shown that long-term aspirin use can reduce the risk of deaths due to cancer,\" Dr. Asad Umar of the National Cancer Institute's division of cancer prevention tells Shots.\n\nIn fact, Umar says, no drug has been shown before now to prevent cancer deaths. \"This is definitely hypothesis-generating for future studies,\" Umar says.\n\nMassachusetts General Hospital's Dr. Andrew Chan, who studies the effect of aspirin on gastrointestinal cancers, says the new study will feed a growing sense among experts \"that there is likely some potential anticancer effect of aspirin.\"\n\nDr. Peter Rothwell, an Oxford University neurologist who led the study, tells Shots that aspirin's effect on cancer is \"quite a lot bigger\" than its benefit in preventing heart attacks and strokes -- the reason millions of Americans already swallow a baby aspirin every day.\n\n\"So I think in the fullness of time, preventing cancer will be seen to be the main reason for taking aspirin in healthy individuals,\" Rothwell says.\n\nHe started taking a daily dose of aspirin a couple of years ago as the results of his study emerged. \"It was looking as though there was something going on, and I thought it was a sufficiently large benefit to be worth doing something about,\" says the 46-year-old researcher.\n\nRothwell says the \"sensible time\" to start taking aspirin \"would be before the risk of cancer starts to rise, at about 45.\" He says prophylactic aspirin is \"worth thinking about\" for people with a family history of early cancers.\n\nBut aspirin carries risks. The biggest is stomach bleeding, although it also raises the risk of brain hemorrhage. Daily aspirin doubles a person's gastrointestinal bleeding risk to about 2 in every 1,000 people a year. But Rothwell says this bleeding hazard is \"drowned out\" by the cancer benefit.\n\nProf. Peter Elwood of the University of Cardiff, who wasn't involved in the new study, agrees. \"There's a small risk of any of us having a gastric bleed,\" Ellwood said at a Lancet press conference Monday. \"But when you inspect the data\u2026you find that the mortality from the bleed is not increased. In other words, aspirin seems to be increasing the less-serious bleeds,\" he said.\n\nTo be sure, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's currently recommends against taking aspirin to prevent colorectal cancer, the type of cancer for which there is the largest body of scientific work. The benefits of daily low-dose aspirin can exceed the risks for many middle-aged and older people when it comes to preventing heart attacks and strokes, the task force says.\n\nSo for those already taking prophylactic aspirin for this reason, the possible anticancer effects are just icing on the cake. Other healthy people interested in taking aspirin to prevent cancer should consult their doctors, experts say, and possibly await further evidence.\n\nA final word about dose: The new study didn't find any additional anticancer benefit for aspirin doses above 75 milligrams a day -- the British dose for a \"baby\" aspirin. In the United States, a baby aspirin weighs in at 81 milligrams. However, experts say more information is needed on the optimum dose for cancer prevention.\n\n\"There's a little controversy about whether a baby aspirin dose is enough,\" says Harvard's Chan. \"We think that probably a standard adult aspirin dose of 325 milligrams is more likely to be effective.\"", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The availability of aspirin is widely known.

Experts attribute the pelvic pain to prostaglandins, a hormone-like substance that contributes to the contraction and relaxation of muscles and blood vessels.\n\nVitamin D3 apparently helped hamper prostaglandin production in study participants, easing their pain, said Dr. Jill Rabin, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y. The vitamin is also known to have anti-inflammatory effects, Rabin added.\n\n\"The bottom line is, it looked like it worked,\" said Rabin, also head of urogynecology at the hospital. \"It was a very well-done study, but my comment is, it was one study. It asks more questions than it answers, which is the sign of a good trial.\"\n\nThe 300,000 IU dose of vitamin D3 given in the study also far exceeds the daily intake of 600 IUs recommended for American women of reproductive age, both Graham and Rabin said. And since the study period lasted only two months, there was no way to tell whether such a high dose produced any toxic long-term effects.\n\nCurrently used methods of controlling menstrual cramps include NSAIDs and -- among those with severe pain -- birth control pills. But both have potential risks: NSAID users can experience stomach or kidney troubles, for example, while birth control pills are linked to blood clots in certain women. The cost of vitamin D supplements would be roughly comparable with both of these remedies.\n\nVitamin D use has also been widely studied as a possible preventive for many other conditions, including heart disease, certain cancers and autoimmune disorders.\n\nThe Italian study participants all had blood levels of vitamin D measuring in the lowest 25 percent of normal at the study's outset, although the researchers didn't report the womens' blood levels afterward. Experts wondered if women with higher blood levels would experience such dramatic cramp relief as observed in the study.\n\nGraham and Rabin agreed that much larger trials should be done before they would recommend vitamin D3 use to any of their patients for cramp relief.\n\n\"From a symptomatic standpoint, it's something to be considered, but more studies are needed to see the risks and benefits,\" Graham said. \"Studies like this are starting to show that vitamin D is ubiquitous in receptors in our bodies . . . but it needs further explanation.\"\n\nTo find out more about painful menstrual periods, head to the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story could have done a better job on this point.

Optimistic people are likely to have better diets, they\u2019re exercising more, and they\u2019re getting better sleep.\u201d\n\nHowever, even after the researchers accounted for these factors, the results still suggest that optimism itself is linked to a longer life.\n\n\u201cSo it could be that optimism directly impacts our biological functioning,\u201d Hagan said. \u201cOptimism is linked with lower inflammation and healthier biomarker levels and lipid levels, so there could be an independent effect on optimism.\u201d\n\nShe said her team plans to focus more on the potential impact of optimism on biological functioning in future research.\n\nThe authors point out that since the study was only done in women, who were mainly white, the results might not be generalizable to other populations. However, they note, \u201cthere is no clear basis for believing that the effects of optimism on health differ by sex or race.\u201d\n\nFinally, the researchers emphasize that while some people may think they\u2019re just not optimistic, it is something that is modifiable. They suggested a number of steps people can take to improve their level of optimism.\n\n\u201cOne is called \u2018best possible self,\u2019\u201d Eric Kim, who also co-led the study, told CBS News. \u201cSo you think about your different domains of life, whether it\u2019s your personal relationship, your spouse, your career, your friendships, and in each of those domains you think about the best possible outcome.\u201d\n\nHagan had some suggestions, too. \u201cSimple things like thinking about what you\u2019re grateful for every day or writing down what things make you happy or what things you\u2019re looking forward to can help someone to increase their optimism, which can improve health outcomes as we\u2019ve seen here,\u201d she said.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Optimism\u00a0may not be FDA-approved, but we\u2019ll optimistically assume all readers know that it\u2019s widely available.

The patients (some of whom had been given a low-dose aspirin regimen, while others were not) were tracked for up to 20 years after.\n\nThe authors determined that while the studies were still underway, overall cancer death risk plummeted by 21 percent among those taking low-dose aspirin. But the long-term benefits on some specific cancers began to show five years after the studies ended.\n\nAt five years out, death due to gastrointestinal cancers had sunk by 54 percent among those patients taking low-dose aspirin.\n\nThe protective impact of low-dose aspirin on stomach and colorectal cancer death was not seen until 10 years out, and for prostate cancer, the benefits first appeared 15 years down the road.\n\nTwenty years after first beginning a low-dose aspirin program, death risk dropped by 10 percent among prostate cancer patients; 30 percent among lung cancer patients (although only those with adenocarcinomas, the type typically seen in nonsmokers); 40 percent among colorectal cancer patients; and 60 percent among esophageal cancer patients.\n\nThe potential impact of aspirin on pancreatic, stomach and brain cancer death rates was more problematic to gauge, the authors noted, due to the relative paucity of deaths from those specific diseases.\n\nThey also found that higher doses of aspirin did not appear to boost the protective benefit. And while neither gender nor smoking history appeared to affect the impact of low-dose aspirin, age definitely did: the 20-year risk of death went down more dramatically among older patients.\n\nAnd while cautioning that more research is necessary to build on this \"proof of principle,\" the authors suggested that people who embark on a long-term, low-dose aspirin regimen in their late 40s and 50s are probably the ones who stand to benefit the most.\n\nDr. Alan Arslan, an assistant professor in the departments of obstetrics and gynecology and environmental medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, described the findings as \"very significant.\"\n\n\"[This] is the largest study to show that people who take aspirin for a long period of time have a reduced risk of death from many cancers, especially gastrointestinal cancers,\" he noted.\n\n\"The take-home message for patients is that if someone is taking low-dose or regular aspirin, it may put them at a reduced risk of death from cancer,\" Arslan added. \"However, if someone is not already taking aspirin they should talk with their physician before starting.

About half of the participants received the clot-busting drug at the hospital, and half received it while still in the ambulance.\n\nThis preliminary study showed that three months after stroke, 182 out of every 1,000 patients treated before arriving at hospital were less disabled, including 58 patients who had zero disability, compared to people who received treatment after reaching the hospital.\n\n\"Time is brain in acute stroke after vascular collaterals fail, and faster treatment yields better outcomes,\" said May Nour, M.D., Ph.D., lead researcher, interventional neurologist and director of UCLA's Mobile Stroke Rescue Program. \"Our study shows pre-hospital clot-busting is a promising, evolving approach to providing tPA stroke therapy. Its better outcomes could offset the increased costs of a mobile stroke unit.\"\n\nPast research showed the sooner that a clot-busting tPA drug is given after an ischemic stroke - one in which a clot is blocking blood flow - the better patients fare. But tPA is not indicated and could hurt a patient's chances if they are having a hemorrhagic stroke, in which a blood vessel ruptures. That is why patients need a CT scan to confirm the type of stroke before receiving tPA.\n\nEvery second counts, in the current standard of care, patients who experience stroke-like symptoms and call 9-1-1 arriving to the hospital by ambulance are assessed by clinical examination and imaging (CT or MRI scan) in the Emergency Department.

But tailoring those guidelines to better fit individuals could prevent many more heart attacks and strokes, say developers of a computer model that makes those calculations.\n\nTheir study, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, estimated the effects of using \u201cindividualized guidelines\u201d to make decisions on treating high blood pressure.\n\nIt found that the tailored approach could prevent 43 percent more heart attacks and strokes than the simpler, general recommendations used now.\n\nCurrently, U.S. guidelines recommend treatment if blood pressure rises above 140/90 mm Hg, or above 130/80 mm Hg if a person has diabetes or chronic kidney disease.\n\nDoctors generally add their own judgment to that decision as well. If, for instance, a person has slightly elevated blood pressure but is otherwise at low risk for heart problems, then lifestyle changes might be enough.\n\nBut the new study looked at a more sophisticated way of estimating individual patients\u2019 needs. Researchers used a computer-based \u201crisk calculator\u201d that took into account a person\u2019s age, cholesterol levels, family history of heart disease and any diabetes diagnosis.\n\nIt also factored in what\u2019s known about different types of patients\u2019 responses to various blood pressure medications.\n\nThe researchers then used data from a long-term study of 15,800 Americans to estimate the effects of applying the individualized guidelines.\n\nOverall, they found, the tailored method could prevent 43 percent more heart attacks and strokes than national guidelines, if healthcare costs were kept the same.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the number of heart attacks and strokes prevented were kept the same, the individualized guidelines would accomplish that result at a 67 percent cost savings versus the national guidelines.\n\nThe goal of using the risk calculator \u201cis the same as the physician\u2019s desire to take into account the \u2018whole patient\u2019 when discussing treatment options with patients,\u201d said lead researcher Dr. David M. Eddy.\n\nThe problem with the old-fashioned way, he told Reuters Health in an email, is that there are many pieces of information about a patient to consider.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible for the human brain to digest it all and estimate accurately the patient\u2019s risks or how they would benefit from treatments,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Eddy, risk calculators like the one in the study could, eventually, help doctors give patients real numbers. A doctor might tell you, for example, what your risk is of developing diabetes in the next 20 years, and how much you could cut that risk if you lose a certain amount of weight (and keep it off).\n\nEddy is a founder of Archimedes, Inc., a San Francisco-based company that has developed a computer-based mathematical model to aid in healthcare decisions. The calculator used in this study is a simplified version of that model.\n\nEddy said that the calculator, or others like it, could be integrated into electronic health records. A patient\u2019s information could be automatically fed to the calculator, and the results would then be displayed on a computer for the doctor and patient to discuss.\n\nA researcher not involved in the work said it was a \u201cnice study\u201d that is a first step toward showing that tailored guidelines could have benefits.\n\n\u201cThis shows that there might be better ways for physicians to choose who gets treated and who does not,\u201d said Dr. Douglas K. Owens of the VA Palo Alto Health Care System in California, who wrote an editorial published with the study.\n\nGeneral guidelines, like those for treating high blood pressure, are kept fairly simple so they are easy to remember, Owens told Reuters Health in an interview. Doctors, ideally, then adapt those guidelines to individual patients\u2019 situations.\n\nHowever, Owens said, \u201cit\u2019s hard to do all of that in your head. This gives them a tool.\u201d\n\nNow the looming questions are how to implement risk calculators in doctors\u2019 practices \u2014 and, Owens said, whether that benefits patients\u2019 health in the real world.\n\n\u201cThe general theme is that we can do better, and we may have an opportunity to improve patients\u2019 health outcomes,\u201d Owens said. \u201cThat\u2019s the hope.\u201d\n\nHe said he thinks electronic health records will be key to putting individualized guidelines into practice.\n\nAnd right now, there is a way to go before most doctors will have those systems in place.\n\nA recent government survey found that the percentage of U.S. doctors using electronic health records is on the rise, but still fairly low.\n\nAbout one-quarter of surveyed doctors said they had \u201cbasic\u201d electronic medical record systems in their offices.

In some cases however, patients maintained a clinical response after stopping the TNFi altogether.\n\n\"The optimal management of RA involves achieving the lowest possible disease activity - ideally remission, and then maintaining this level of control,\" said lead author, Dr. James Galloway, Department of Rheumatology, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UK. \"Findings from our study have shown that adopting a TNFi dose reduction strategy can still meet this objective, with no compromise on symptom control for the patient and offering a more cost-effective option by substantially reducing the high drug costs associated with TNFi maintenance therapy.\"\n\nRA is a chronic inflammatory disease characterised by joint inflammation and damage, functional disability and significantly increased mortality. Early intervention using a conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) such as methotrexate is critical in preventing structural joint damage and progressive loss of function. For those patients who either fail to respond, or who develop an inadequate response to these drugs over time, a biologic DMARD is an effective add-on treatment option.2 The first choice of biologic therapy is usually a TNFi2 and currently identical dosing regimens of TNFi are used both to induce and then maintain a clinical response.1\n\nOver the first six months of the study, flares (exacerbations of symptoms and signs) occurred in 14% of patients who stayed on the same TNFi dose, compared to a similar figure of 13% in those patients for whom the dose was reduced by one-third. A two-thirds dose reduction increased the odds of a flare occurring by four times compared with a one-third dose reduction, with flares occurring in 37% of patients. Post-dose reduction flares resolved when the original dose of TNFi was restarted.

These limited screening criteria also missed more racial and ethnic minorities, most notably Asians.\n\nFailing to screen high-risk adults could lead to delayed treatments to prevent type 2 diabetes or manage the condition for those who already have it, possibly contributing to a worsening of the diabetes epidemic. Prediabetes and diabetes affect half of U.S. adults with an estimated cost of $327 billion per year.\n\nThe United States Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) currently recommends that physicians screen patients for dysglycemia (prediabetes or type 2 diabetes) when they are 40 to 70 years old and are overweight or obese. By following this recommendation, 53 percent of patients who had prediabetes or type 2 diabetes would not be screened. The study showed that screening patients using an expanded set of risk factors, which the USPSTF suggests but does not formally recommend, would identify most cases of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.\n\nOnly 23 percent of patients with prediabetes or diabetes would be missed if expanded screening criteria were used to make screening decisions, the study found. The expanded criteria include a family history of diabetes, history of gestational diabetes or polycystic ovarian syndrome or non-white race or ethnicity.\n\n\"This seems like a no-brainer to screen patients who have any of these additional risk factors,\" said lead author Dr. Matthew O'Brien, assistant professor of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. \"By demonstrating how well these expanded criteria work in identifying patients with prediabetes and diabetes, we're proposing a better path for the USPSTF to strengthen its screening guidelines.\"\n\nThe study was published today, Friday, April 13, in the Journal of General Internal Medicine. O'Brien will be presenting his findings today at the Society for General Internal Medicine conference in Denver, Colorado. This is the first study to report how these expanded screening criteria would perform in practice among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults.\n\nThe USPSTF has come under scrutiny for other screening recommendations, most notably for breast cancer. But there has been little attention focused on this group's most recent diabetes screening guideline.\n\nIntensive lifestyle programs and some medications have been proven to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes among adults with prediabetes. A large volume of research over the last three decades has demonstrated that treating type 2 diabetes prevents life-threatening complications such as heart attacks, strokes and kidney failure.\n\n\"The earlier patients are diagnosed with these conditions, the sooner they can begin to combat them,\" O'Brien said.\n\nAfrican-Americans and Latinos develop type 2 diabetes at younger ages, so waiting until they are 40 years old to screen them is problematic, O'Brien said. In the study, 50 percent of whites with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes were identified using the limited criteria compared to only 48 percent of African-Americans and only 44 percent of Latinos.\n\nAsians are at high risk of developing diabetes even at a healthy weight. By following the limited guidelines and only screening patients who are overweight or obese, approximately 30 percent of Asians with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes would be identified. That would leave 70 percent of Asians with prediabetes or diabetes undiagnosed until their next screening test, which could occur years later.\n\nThe study also touches on the financial implications of these guidelines. Under a provision in the Affordable Care Act, all services recommended by the USPSTF must be fully covered by insurers. But O'Brien said it is unclear whether insurers will be required to pay for diabetes screening if patients only meet the expanded criteria.\n\n\"This could be a particular problem for people of low socioeconomic status who are at high risk of developing diabetes and may be unable to pay for a screening test,\" O'Brien said.\n\nThe study was conducted collaboratively with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), using data collected every year from a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. It builds on findings from a previous study O'Brien conducted that incorporated electronic health record data from 50,515 adult primary care patients at community health centers in the Midwest and Southwest between 2008 and 2013.\n\nOther Northwestern authors are senior author Dr. Ronald Ackermann and co-authors Mercedes Carnethon and Dr. Namratha Kandula.

(TSE:6501, \u201cHitachi\u201d) today announced that Johns Hopkins Medicine has selected Hitachi to provide its proton beam therapy (PBT) system at Sibley Memorial Hospital located in Washington, D.C. This collaboration, which includes a 10-year maintenance service, marks the first multi-room PBT application in the nation\u2019s capital. This will be Hitachi\u2019s fifth PBT system in North America.\n\nThe next-generation system \u201cPROBEAT\u201d, which comes with IMPT (Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy) and cone-beam CT, will have improved spot scanning capability in all 3 gantry-type treatment rooms, along with a fixed irradiation room dedicated to cancer research.\n\nToshiaki Higashihara, President & COO of Hitachi, Ltd. stated that, \u201cWe are greatly honored that Johns Hopkins selected Hitachi as their proton partner. As one of the leaders in cancer research and treatment, the Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center\u2019s philosophy of being at the leading edge of cancer treatment through research and development is very similar to our Social Innovation concept which supports a healthy and secure society through innovative technologies, systems, solutions and services. The proton center at Sibley Memorial Hospital will be an impressive demonstration of industry and academic medicine collaborating to bring a new technology and new cancer treatment modality to Washington, D.C. and the surrounding communities. Thus, we foresee an exciting, long term relationship that will benefit cancer patients and cancer research.\u201d\n\nIn December 2007, Hitachi was the first company in the U.S. to clear FDA Premarket Notification Special 510(k) for the \u201cPROBEAT\u201d system with its spot scanning irradiation technology. Hitachi has delivered the first hospital based spot scanning system in May 2008 and has treated over 1,500 patients to date. The same spot scanning system has already been installed at Nagoya Proton Therapy Center and Hokkaido University in Japan. In fiscal year 2015 (ending March 2016), one of Hitachi's new PBT site is planning to start treatment of patients. Hitachi has shown great stability in the proton market through continued investment in research and development, track record for high clinical availability of over 98%, along with a commitment to a long term partnership with all of its clients.\n\nGiven the growing demand for technical and clinical advancements in the treatment of cancer, interest in proton therapy is on the rise, with more and more hospitals and cancer treatment facilities venturing into this area. Hitachi will continue to globally expand the healthcare business where proton therapy is its flagship solution, and contribute to cancer treatment around the world.\n\nProton Beam Therapy (PBT) is an advanced type of cancer radiotherapy. Protons from a hydrogen atom are extracted and accelerated up to 70% the speed of light. Its energy is concentrated directly on the tumor while avoiding radiation dose to the surrounding healthy tissues. PBT improves the quality of life for cancer patients since the patient experiences no pain during treatment and the procedure has very few side effects compared with that of traditional radiotherapy. In most cases, patients can continue with their normal daily activities while undergoing treatment. Because there are fewer side effects, PBT is expected to expand, especially for pediatric treatment.\n\nUnlike conventional scattering technology, spot scanning technology delivers narrow beams to the tumor and the complex tumor shape can be irradiated through repetitive beam delivery with quick position change. Spot scanning technology has been achieved by advancing the uniform quality beam extraction technology from the accelerator and beam control technology with high accuracy. Three primary benefits are: (1) more accurate irradiation which reduces the side effects to healthy tissues surrounding the tumor compared with irradiation from conventional double scattering irradiation; (2) patient-specific collimators and boluses become obsolete, shortening set up times for patients; and (3) high proton beam usage factor reducing unnecessary secondary radiation.\n\nHitachi, Ltd. (TSE: 6501), headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, delivers innovations that answer society\u2019s challenges with our talented team and proven experience in global markets. The company\u2019s consolidated revenues for fiscal 2014 (ended March 31, 2015) totaled 9,761 billion yen ($81.3 billion).

The third in a series of studies from the Andersen lab involving PD and low-dose lithium, the results add to mounting evidence that low-doses of the psychotropic drug could benefit patients suffering from the incurable, degenerative condition.\n\nThis study, published online in Brain Research, involved Parkinsonian mice that were given Carbidopa/Levodopa (sold as Sinemet\u00ae), a drug used to boost levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is lost in PD. While the medication remains the single most effective agent in the management of PD symptoms, long-term use causes its own side effects, among them abnormal involuntary movements or AIMS. Buck professor and senior scientist Julie Andersen, PhD, says AIMS become problematic for 30 percent of patients after four to six years of treatment with Sinemet, with 90 percent of patients suffering from the complication after nine years of chronic use. \"For patients these side effects are just as devastating as the freezing that is associated with PD.\" \"In our mice we saw significant behavioral improvement.\"\n\nIn this study, Andersen and her team dosed the mice with an amount of lithium equivalent to about a quarter of what humans receive for the treatment of psychiatric diseases. Researchers found that lithium boosted the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase which increases dopamine synthesis via the inhibition of calpain-1, an enzyme that normally reduces dopamine synthesis.\n\nIn earlier studies, Andersen's team found that low-dose lithium was protective in two different mouse models of PD. Treatment in mice with a human mutation for PD began when the animals reached late middle-age, the human equivalent of about 60, which is the average age of onset of Parkinson's in humans. \"We clearly saw a prevention of the motor difficulties we would expect to see in the animals,\" said Andersen. \"The treatment also protected the area of the brain that is normally damaged by Parkinson's.\"\n\nPlans for a clinical trial of low-dose lithium for PD patients are in early stages. \"This study suggests potential therapeutic benefit in PD,\" said David K. Simon, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Simon chairs the Scientific Review Committee for the Parkinson's Study Group, a not-for-profit network of Parkinson's Centers. \"One caveat is that other agents that have shown clear efficacy in this model of PD have subsequently failed to show benefit in clinical studies in PD (e.g. CoQ10, creatine, and pioglitazone). However, this study provides additional evidence on top of prior work from Dr. Andersen's lab and others that lithium may have therapeutic potential in PD, which is a hypothesis that should be tested in clinical trials,\" he said.\n\nLithium is a naturally occurring element, not a 'developed' molecule like most medications. It was approved by the FDA for the treatment of bipolar disorder in 1970 and has shown to be effective for treating mood disorders and suicidal thoughts. Previous studies suggest that at low doses lithium has a protective effect in other neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's and Huntington's.\n\nCitation: The combination of lithium and L-Dopa/Carbidopa reduces MPTP-induced abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) via calpain-1 inhibition in a mouse model: relevance for Parkinson's disease therapy.\n\nThis work was supported by grants from National Institutes of Health 5P20GM103653-02; RL!

In the United States, physicians diagnose more than 10,000 cases each year. While more than 4,000 American women die of the disease each year, the mortality rate has dropped more than 50 percent in the past four decades, largely due to the advent of well-organized screening and diagnostic programs.\n\nWhile the Pap smear can be performed by a non-specialist, colposcopy requires visualization of the cervix, relying on highly trained professionals and expensive equipment that is not easily accessible to underserved populations. These factors make cervical cancer more prevalent in women living in low socioeconomic communities.\n\nIn a new paper published on May 31 in the journal PLOS One, researchers from Duke believe they have found a better way.\n\n\"The mortality rate of cervical cancer should absolutely be zero percent because we have all the tools to see and treat it,\" said Nimmi Ramanujam, the Robert W. Carr, Jr., Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Duke. \"But it isn't. That is in part because women do not receive screening or do not follow up on a positive screening to have colposcopy performed at a referral clinic. We need to bring colposcopy to women so that we can reduce this complicated string of actions into a single touch point.\"\n\nCurrent standard practices for cervical cancer screening require three things: a speculum, a colposcope and a trained professional to administer the test.\n\nThe speculum is a metal device designed to spread the vaginal walls apart. The colposcope is a magnified telescopic device and camera designed to allow medical professionals to look through the speculum to see the cervix, which is located three to six inches inside the vagina. Colposcopes and people who know how to use them are difficult to find in many low-income regions, both domestically and internationally.\n\nRamanujam believes she can replace at least two of these requirements. Her laboratory has developed an all-in-one device that resembles a pocket-sized tampon with lights and a camera at one end. Health providers -- or even women themselves -- are able to capture images of the cervix using the rounded tip of the device to manipulate its position if necessary. The device also includes a channel through which contrast agents used for the cervical cancer screening procedure can be applied.\n\n\"We recruited 15 volunteers on Duke's campus to try out the new integrated speculum-colposcope design,\" said Mercy Asiedu, a graduate student working on the project in Ramanujam's lab. \"Nearly everyone said they preferred it to a traditional speculum and more than 80 percent of the women who tried the device were able to get a good image. Those that couldn't felt that they just needed some practice.\"\n\nRamanujam and Asiedu are now working on clinical trials to see how their design stacks up against the traditional colposcopy used with a speculum. By using both methods to visualize the cervix, the researchers will be able to make a direct comparison.\n\nAsiedu is also working to automate the screening process. By using image processing and machine learning to teach computers how to spot signs of precancerous and cancerous cells, Asiedu hopes to remove the need for a trained physician at any point in the screening process and shift the task to midwives, community health workers and even the women themselves.\n\n\"There have been a few other attempts to come up with a better solution, but none of them have succeeded,\" said Asiedu. \"One design using an inflatable cylinder proved just as uncomfortable as a traditional speculum. Another using directed airflow is just as bulky and expensive as a modern colposcope.

For expectant mothers hospitalized with flu, early treatment with the influenza antiviral drug oseltamivir may shorten their time in the hospital, especially in severe cases, suggests a new study published in The Journal of Infectious Diseases and available online. The findings also underscore the importance of flu vaccination for this risk group.\n\n\"Treating pregnant women who have influenza with antiviral drugs can have substantial benefit in terms of reducing length of stay in the hospital,\" said Sandra S. Chaves, MD, MSc, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and senior author of the study. CDC recommends treatment of suspected cases of flu among pregnant women with antiviral drugs as soon as possible, without waiting for test results to confirm influenza. \"The earlier you treat, the better chances you have to modify the course of the illness.\"\n\nPast studies have suggested that flu antiviral therapy is safe and beneficial for pregnant women. The current study, based on data from a nationwide flu surveillance network including 14 states, focused on pregnant women hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed flu over four recent flu seasons, from 2010 to 2014. During the study period, 865 pregnant women were hospitalized with flu. Sixty-three of these patients, or about 7 percent, had severe illness.\n\nAfter adjusting for underlying medical conditions, vaccination status, and pregnancy trimester, the researchers found that early treatment with the antiviral drug oseltamivir was associated with a shorter hospital stay. Among pregnant women with severe flu illness who were treated early -- within two days of the start of symptoms -- the median length of stay was about five days shorter compared to hospitalized pregnant women with severe flu illness who were treated later (2.2 days vs. 7.8 days). Pregnant women hospitalized with less severe illness who were treated early also had a shorter hospital stay than those treated later, but the difference was not as great.\n\nIn the study, pregnant women hospitalized with severe flu illness were half as likely to have been vaccinated as women hospitalized with milder illness (14 percent vs. 26 percent). CDC recommends annual flu vaccination for everyone 6 months of age and older, including pregnant women during any trimester of their pregnancy.

All compared people taking at least 200 milligrams of Vitamin C each day with people taking placebos. The researchers added up how often people in those studies got colds, and how long those colds tended to last. And the results, just published by The Cochrane Library, are likely to disappoint people who swear by vitamin C.\n\nAccording to their analysis, daily vitamin C basically had no effect on the incidence of the common cold in the general population, except for very specific groups of people, all of them small groups. It did reduce the severity and duration of colds slightly, but the researchers say the difference was so slight it ended up being pretty meaningless, and not worth the effort or expense of taking all that vitamin C.\n\nPeople apparently protected from colds by vitamin C, Senay said, are those who subject their immune systems to extraordinary amounts of physical stress, such as people who run marathons, or do serious trekking in the winter. The researchers found that these people were 50 percent less likely to catch cold if they took vitamin C daily. But they were the exceptions.\n\nThe message from the researchers, Senay observed, is that, if your activity profile doesn't match that of people like these, vitamin C won't keep colds away.\n\nBut, she emphasized, this doesn't mean vitamin C is useless, not by a long shot.\n\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, vitamin C has several important benefits. Preventing colds just isn't one of them. Vitamin C is an important building block for the growth and repair of tissues throughout your body, including skin, tendons, ligaments and blood vessels. If you suffer an injury, vitamin C is a vital part of the healing process. Vitamin C is also an antioxidant, which means it's believed to help prevent or minimize conditions that include cancer, heart disease, and inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. So, even if it doesn't fight colds, you do need a certain amount of it daily for other aspects of your health.\n\nFor adult males, the recommended amount is 90 milligrams per day. For women, it's 75 milligrams. Citrus fruits and juices, strawberries and broccoli are among the many foods that are rich in vitamin C.\n\nSo, where does this research leave us in the fight against the common cold?\n\nIt makes us look toward other methods, aside from vitamin C, Senay concluded. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the best bit of cold prevention involves not taking a pill, but doing simple, if boring, things such as washing your hands, thoroughly and often.\n\nUntil a magic pill is found, keeping your hands clean, and not sharing items such as drinking cups and utensils with someone who has a cold, are still considered the most practical ways to avoid getting sick.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Vitamin C supplements are widely available.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "DUARTE, Calif. -- A City of Hope-led study found that the use of low-dose aspirin (81mg) reduces the risk of breast cancer in women who are part of the California's Teacher's Study. This study -- which is the first to suggest that the reduction in risk occurs for low-dose aspirin -- was proposed by City of Hope's Leslie Bernstein, Ph.D., professor and director of the Division of Biomarkers of Early Detection and Prevention, and published online in the journal, Breast Cancer Research.\n\nBernstein and her colleagues saw an overall 16 percent lower risk of breast cancer in women who reported using low-dose aspirin at least three times per week. Such regular use of low-dose aspirin reduced the risk by 20 percent of estrogen or progesterone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer, which is the most common breast cancer subtype.\n\n\"The study found an interesting protective association between low-dose aspirin and breast cancer,\" said lead author Christina A. Clarke, Ph.D., M.P.H., from the Cancer Prevention Institute of California. \"We did not by and large find associations with the other pain medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. We also did not find associations with regular aspirin since this type of medication is taken sporadically for headaches or other pain, and not daily for prevention of cardiovascular disease.\"\n\nThis study differed from other studies that have looked at aspirin and cancer risk because it focused on the dose levels of the aspirin women had taken and tracked the frequency of the use of low-dose aspirin as opposed to regular aspirin. It was also able to look in detail at subtypes of breast cancer.\n\n\"We already knew that aspirin is a weak aromatase inhibitor and we treat women with breast cancer with stronger aromatase inhibitors since they reduce the amount of estrogen postmenopausal women have circulating in their blood,\" said Bernstein. \"We thought that if aspirin can inhibit aromatase, it ought to reduce the likelihood that breast cancer would develop and it could also be an effective way to improve breast cancer patients' prognosis once they no longer take the more potent aromatase inhibitors.\" Bernstein added, \"Aspirin also reduces inflammation, which may be another mechanism by which aspirin taken regularly can lower risk of breast cancer developing or recurring.\"\n\nAs part of the study, researchers analyzed data recorded in questionnaires submitted by 57,164 women in the California's Teacher's Study. In 2005, participants answered questions regarding family history of cancer and other conditions, use of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), menstrual and reproductive history, use of hormones, weight and height, living environment, diet, alcohol use and physical activity. In the ensuing years before 2013, 1,457 of these participants developed invasive breast cancer.\n\nThe team of researchers chose to focus on low-dose \"baby\" aspirin, because not only is it inexpensive and readily available as potential means of prevention, but because there are already a lot of people already taking it for prevention of other diseases such as heart disease and even colon cancer.\n\nNow that we have some data separating low-dose from higher-dose aspirin, more detailed research can be undertaken to understand the full value of low-dose aspirin for breast cancer prevention,\" said Clarke.\"\n\nOther collaborating authors include Alison J.

The study led by Professor Roy Taylor, from Newcastle University, and Professor Mike lean from Glasgow University, found that 45.6% of those who were put on a low calorie diet for three to five months and were able to stop their Type 2 diabetes medications. Importantly, long-term support by routine General Practice staff was given to help the paticipants maintain their weight loss. The trial, called DiRECT (Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial) and funded by Diabetes UK, recruited 298 people between the Newcastle and Glasgow University and builds on Professor Taylor\u2019s earlier pilot work. Professor Taylor, lead researcher of the DiRECT trial, said: \u201cThese findings are very exciting. They could revolutionise the way Type 2 diabetes is treated. \u201cThe study builds on the work into the underlying cause of the condition, so that we can target management effectively. \u201cSubstantial weight loss results in reduced fat inside the liver and pancreas, allowing these organs to return to normal function. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing from DiRECT is that losing weight isn\u2019t just linked to better management of Type 2 diabetes: significant weight loss could actually result in lasting remission.\"\n\nRemission was defined as having blood glucose levels (HbA1c) of less than 6.5% (48mmol/mol) at 12 months, with at least two months without any Type 2 diabetes medications. Of the 298 people recruited to take part in DiRECT, half received standard diabetes care from their GP, whilst the other half received a structured weight management programme within primary care. The programme included a low calorie, nutrient-complete diet for three to five months, food reintroduction and long-term support to maintain weight loss. Type 2 diabetes remission was found to be closely related to weight loss. Over half (57%) of those who lost 10 to 15kg achieved remission, along with a third (34%) of those who lost five to 10kg. Only 4% of the control group achieved remission. The findings have been presented at the International Diabetes Federation Congress in Abu Dhabi today by the lead researchers, Professor Taylor and Professor Mike Lean. Professor Lean said: \u201cPutting Type 2 diabetes into remission as early as possible after diagnosis could have extraordinary benefits, both for the individual and the NHS. DiRECT is telling us it could be possible for as many as half of patients to achieve this in routine primary care, and without drugs. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that people were really interested in this approach \u2013 almost a third of those who were asked to take part in the study agreed. This is much higher than usual acceptance rates for diabetes clinical trials.\"\n\nDiRECT is a two-year trial which aims to find an effective and accessible way to put Type 2 diabetes into remission for the long-term. The trial is delivered through GP practices across Tyneside and Scotland to find out if the benefits of a structured weight management programme can be felt in a real-life primary care setting. DiRECT also aims to understand why significant weight loss results in remission, to understand which groups might benefit in the future. Type 2 diabetes is a life-changing condition that progresses over time, which can have devastating consequences. Finding ways to put it into lasting remission could significantly reduce the cost of delivering diabetes care and treating serious complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney disease or stroke. Remission could transform the lives of millions of people living with or at risk of Type 2 diabetes. Isobel Murray, 65, from North Ayrshire, took part in DiRECT from 2014 to 2016. She was on the low calorie diet programme for 17 weeks and put her Type 2 diabetes into remission after the first four months. Over the two year trial, Isobel lost more than three and a half stone and no longer needs to take any diabetes medication. Isobel said: \u201cIt has transformed my life, I had Type 2 diabetes for two to three years before the study. \u201cI was on various medications which were constantly increasing and I was becoming more and more ill every day. When the opportunity came to go on the DiRECT study, I had absolutely no hesitation. \u201cWhen the doctors told me that my pancreas was working again, it felt fantastic, absolutely amazing. \u201cI don\u2019t think of myself as a diabetic anymore, I get all my diabetes checks done, but I don\u2019t feel like a diabetic. I am one of the lucky ones to have gone into remission.\u201d Diabetes UK has committed more than \u00a32.8 million to the DiRECT study. Recently, \u00a3300,000 has been committed so participants who wish to continue can be followed for up to three years and the full cost-effectiveness of this programme can be evaluated. The funding will provide further understanding around the longer term benefits, to see if a treatment of this kind could be offered to people with Type 2 diabetes in the future. Dr Elizabeth Robertson, Director of Research at Diabetes UK, said: \u201cThese first year findings of DiRECT demonstrate the potential to transform the lives of millions of people. \u201cWe\u2019re very encouraged by these initial results, and the building robust evidence that remission could be achievable for some people. \u201cThe trial is ongoing, so that we can understand the long-term effects of an approach like this. It\u2019s very important that anyone living with Type 2 diabetes considering losing weight in this way seeks support and advice from a healthcare professional.\u201d Whether putting Type 2 diabetes into remission can protect against diabetes-related complications later in life is not yet known, which is why it is important that those who achieve remission continue to receive health checks. More research is also needed to find out who could benefit most from treatments like this in the future, taking into account factors like ethnicity and duration of Type 2 diabetes.

It can be assumed that readers are familiar with the concept.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "Fat was the food villain these past few decades but sugar is quickly muscling in to take its place. As rates of sugar-related disorders such as diabetes, obesity and heart disease climb, many experts believe that when Americans rid themselves of fat, they simply replaced it with sugar in all its forms.\n\nBut that the rise of the chronic diseases was actually linked to higher sugar consumption is a challenge. Dr. Robert Lustig, from the department of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco, who has made a name for himself publishing books and research addressing the question of sugar\u2019s effects on the body, wanted clearer answers. Now, in a paper published Tuesday, he and his colleagues believe they have come up with the definitive evidence that sugar, as Lustig says, \u201cis toxic.\u201d\n\nIn most lab studies, the doses of sugar that scientists test are quite high; they want to see what the effect is quickly and, depending on the research, they may not have time to wait to study the more gradual effects that might emerge. And in studies where people reduce the amount of sugar they eat, for instance, those people end up eating fewer calories overall, so it\u2019s difficult to know whether any changes are due to the removal of sugar or to the drop in calories.\n\nLustig and his colleagues think they\u2019ve produced the \u201chard and fast data that sugar is toxic irrespective of its calories and irrespective of weight.\u201d\n\nMORE: FDA Wants Nutrition Labels to Include More Detail on Added Sugars\n\nLustig\u2019s confidence comes from the unique study, described in , of 43 Hispanic or African-American children aged eight to 18 years old. He collected detailed food questionnaires from each of the adolescents to get an idea of the average amount of calories they ate per day, then designed a special menu for each of them for nine days that matched the total numbers of calories they would normally eat. The only difference in the nine-day diet was that most of the sugar the children ate was replaced by starch \u2014 the overall number of calories remained the same. The children weighed themselves daily, and if they were losing weight, they were told to eat more of the provided food in order to keep their weight the same throughout the study.\n\n\u201cEverything got better,\u201d says Lustig. Some of the children went from being insulin resistant, a precursor state to developing diabetes, in which the body\u2019s insulin levels can no longer keep up with the pace of breaking down sugar that\u2019s coming in from the diet, to insulin sensitive.\n\nMORE: Artificial Sweeteners Aren\u2019t the Answer to Obesity: Here\u2019s Why\n\n\u201cWe took chicken teriyaki out, and put turkey hot dogs in. We took sweetened yogurt out, and put baked potato chips in. We took pastries out and put bagels in,\u201d says Lustig. \u201cSo there was no change in [the children\u2019s] weight and no change in calories.\u201d\n\nAfter nine days of having their total dietary sugar reduced to 10% of their daily calories, however, they showed improvements in all of these measures. Overall, their fasting blood sugar levels dropped by 53%, along with the amount of insulin their bodies produced since insulin is normally needed to break down carbohydrates and sugars. Their triglyceride and LDL levels also declined and, most importantly, they showed less fat in their liver.\n\nMORE: 7 Amazing Things That Happen to Your Body When You Give Up Soda\n\nBecause some of the children lost weight, to convince themselves that the effects weren\u2019t due to the small amount of weight that some of the children lost, Lustig and his team compared those who lost weight to those who didn\u2019t during the study, and found similar improvements in both groups.\n\n\u201cUp until now, there have been a lot of correlation studies linking sugar and metabolic syndrome,\u201d says Lustig. \u201cThis is causation.\u201d\n\nThe diet he provided the children isn\u2019t considered ideal from a health perspective \u2014 starches are still a considerable source of calories and can contribute to weight gain. But Lustig relied on the starches to prove a point in a scientific study \u2014 that the effect sugar has on the body goes beyond anything connected to its calories and to weight. \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting in any way, shape or form that we gave them healthy food,\u201d he says. \u201cWe gave them crappy food, shitty food, processed food \u2014 and they still got better. Imagine how much even better they would have gotten if we didn\u2019t substitute and took the sugar out. Then they would have gotten even better yet. That\u2019s the point.\u201d\n\nMORE: The Trouble With Sugar Free Kids\n\nNot everyone is convinced that the results definitely prove sugar, and not weight loss, is the culprit, however. Susan Roberts, professor of Nutrition, USDA Nutrition Center at Tufts University notes that because some of the children lost weight, it\u2019s still possible that shedding the pounds helped their metabolic measures to improve. She also points out that the children self-reported their initial diet, which can often be inaccurate. \u201cWe know that a healthy diet and weight loss cause good metabolic changes, and although this study tries to attribute its effects to low fructose, in fact it is impossible to do that because of the study design.\u201d\n\nSome experts are concerned for other reasons. They\u2019re worried that the findings may shift attention away from what they consider to be the more fundamental issue \u2014 that overall, we\u2019re eating too much. \u201cToo much calorie intake is still the biggest problem,\u201d says Dr. Mark Corkins, professor of pediatrics at University of Tennessee Health Science Center and member of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on nutrition. He notes that the study involved children who were obese already and consuming too many calories. \u201cIt\u2019s an important study, and the facts coming out of it are very important. It means we need to look at sugars, and at the type of sugars and sugar intake. But I worry that people are going to hang everything on this when we still need to reduce consumption.\u201d\n\nLustig hopes that won\u2019t happen as more data emerges that details how sugar is altering the body in unhealthy ways outside of its caloric contribution. That wasn\u2019t the subject of the current paper, but he promises follow up studies based on this work that will address that. This study does hint however, at what might be happening. While there has been a lot of attention on the presence of belly fat and its connection to metabolic syndrome, the fact that the children saw improvements in the amount of fat in their liver suggests that might be an important way that sugar is contributing to chronic disease. Obese children and those with diabetes often suffer from fatty liver, a condition normally associated with alcohol abuse but increasingly common among non-drinkers who gain excessive amounts of weight.\n\nThis new view of sugar could change the advice that doctors and government health officials give about eating the sweet stuff.

Nabel, director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, which is sponsoring the study.\n\nAlthough the reason for the increased risk remains a mystery, Nabel and other experts stressed that the benefits of blood sugar control have been well established for diabetics and said patients should not make any changes in their care without consulting their doctors.\n\nBut the findings cast doubt on a major hope about diabetes treatment -- that pushing levels below current targets would be beneficial -- and would force experts to rethink how to treat one of the nation's leading health problems.\n\n\"It's profoundly disappointing,\" said Richard Kahn, chief scientific and medical officer for the American Diabetes Association. \"This presents a real dilemma to patients and their physicians.

We have to really ask the question: 'How low do you go?' \"\n\nAn estimated 21 million Americans suffer from Type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the disease, and the number has been increasing because of the obesity epidemic. Diabetes patients' blood sugar levels become abnormally high, causing a host of serious complications including nerve damage, the need for amputations, blindness, and increased risk of heart attacks and strokes.\n\nMany earlier studies had shown that tightly controlling blood sugar significantly reduced the risk of many complications. The new study -- known as the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes, or Accord, trial -- was designed to convincingly test whether various aggressive treatment strategies reduced the risk of heart disease -- the main cause of death among diabetics.\n\nThe study involves 10,251 patients ages 40 to 82 at 77 sites in the United States and Canada at high risk for heart disease for any reason, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol or obesity. About half were placed on a regimen combining diet and exercise with commonly used drugs designed to lower their blood sugar levels to those of the average person with diabetes, while the other half were put on a more intensive regimen designed to drive levels closer to those of someone without diabetes. The patients were further divided into those who also received blood-pressure-lowering medication or drugs to improve their cholesterol levels.\n\nOver about four years, about half of the patients getting intensive treatment achieved blood sugar levels close to normal, and about half the patients in the standard treatment group achieved levels close to the average diabetic.\n\nBut a special 10 member panel that was monitoring the study alerted the organizers that 257 patients r eceiving intensive treatment had died, compared with 203 receiving standard treatment, a difference of 54 deaths -- or 3 per 1,000 participants per year, officials said. About half the excess deaths were from heart disease.\n\n\"We obviously were surprised,\" Nabel said. \"We were hoping for a positive outcome.\"\n\nLetters were mailed to all participants Monday notifying them of the results so they could consult with their doctors about switching to the less intensive therapy.\n\nNabel stressed that while the death rate was higher in the intensive group, the rate in both groups was still lower than would be expected in patients at high risk receiving standard treatment.\n\n\"Although there appear to be some benefit of an overall lower death rate in both groups, the [special panel] recommended stopping the trial,\" Nabel said. \"The harm of the very intensive treatment outweighed the potential benefit.\"\n\nThe researchers stressed that the findings would not alter current guidelines or treatment for most diabetics, many of whom can control their blood sugar without drugs.\n\n\"Few patients with high cardiovascular risk like those studied in Accord are treated to blood sugar levels as low as those tested in this study,\" said Judith Fradkin of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.\n\nDriving blood sugar levels very low might still prove beneficial for other patients, such as those who are younger, were diagnosed more recently or are not at high risk for heart disease.\n\n\"It is not yet known whether controlling glucose to near normal levels will prevent heart disease and extend life in other groups,\" Fradkin said.\n\nOfficials defended the study, saying previous research had suggested that intensive blood sugar lowering would be beneficial.\n\n\"Accord is an important study intended to find new answers to help people with Type 2 diabetes reduce their high risk of heart disease,\" said Denise G. Simons Morton, the project's director.\n\nDespite an intensive analysis, researchers were unable to determine the cause of the excess deaths. Because some of the patients were taking the drug Avandia, which has been the focus of concern that it might increase the risk of heart attacks, the researchers specifically examined whether that was a factor.

It pays clinicians for time spent related to the study, a relationship that could give clinicians an incentive to steer patients to the test \u2014 and give the company access to insurance reimbursement for those patients.\n\nPatients also cannot find out for themselves if their doctor stands to gain financially by recommending a personalized medicine test. A public federal database created in 2014 to disclose financial relationships between the health care industry and physicians excludes most genetic tests.\n\n\u201cIt is the Wild West,\u2019\u2019 said Mildred Cho, associate director at the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics, who says there is little published evidence on the effectiveness of drug response tests.\n\nEric Lander, a leader of the Human Genome Project and founding director of the Broad Institute in Cambridge, goes further, saying in a New England Journal of Medicine article earlier this year that the mental health testing company claims are \u201cnot harmless and may be quite dangerous.\u201d\n\nIn psychiatry, a field hampered by a lack of definitive tests for conditions and treatments alike, the idea of a genetic test to identify the drugs most likely to be effective is particularly appealing as a way to cut down on the trial-and-error approach to medications that many patients face.\n\nAnd the tests do hold promise. The basic science behind them is built on years of solid research \u2014 analyzing an individual\u2019s genetic make-up to determine how they may respond to drugs. GeneSight\u2019s test was developed using technology from the respected Mayo Clinic and Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center.\n\nOfficials at Assurex Health, the Ohio-based company that makes GeneSight, stand behind their product. They make no guarantee that GeneSight will lead doctors to pick the right medicine for patients, but they point to company studies that show it more than doubles the odds they will. Plus, the officials note, the test underwent close review by a Medicare contractor before the agency agreed to pay for the tests.\n\n\u201cPatients do better,\u2019\u2019 said Bryan M. Dechairo, senior vice president of medical affairs and clinical development for Assurex. \u201cWe continue to do more studies\u201d to show the test\u2019s value.\n\nThe amount of money at stake is enormous. Psychiatric conditions affect 1 in 4 adults every year and 1 in 5 teens, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Finding a test to more precisely target treatment could help troubled people find help more quickly, cut down on side effects, and save money. It can also make hundreds of millions of dollars for the test makers, which helps explain why at least 15 companies are now ramping up mental health testing.\n\n\u201cIt is so much more than just getting the medications right,\u2019\u2019 said Rachel Scott, vice president of clinical research and operations for Pennsylvania-based test maker Genomind. \u201cIt is giving patients the opportunity to step outside the stigma of mental illness, for them to see this is their biology \u2014 and give their clinician some objective information.\u201d\n\nBut psychiatric genetics remains in its infancy. Aggressive marketing and a lack of regulation of tests that have a thin scientific foundation have raised concerns for some bioethicists.\n\n\u201cThe claims of these companies are weak,\u2019\u2019 said Robert Klitzman, a psychiatrist and bioethicist at Columbia University in New York who had a commentary published last week in a mental health journal calling for vigilance in the marketing of genetic mental health tests.\n\n\u201cConflicts of interest in the field are major problems,\u201d he said.\n\nLast fall, the owners of the New England Center for Mental Health in Littleton, an adult and child clinic, were asked to be part of a research study.\n\nCalifornia-based Proove Biosciences wanted the center to join a national study, aimed in part at better understanding how its tests benefited adults with mental health conditions.\n\nThe company would provide the center with a full-time research assistant stationed in an office behind the reception desk. If a clinician and patient decided a Proove drug metabolism test, which analyzes 69 genetic variants, would be useful, the assistant would take the patient\u2019s DNA with a cheek swab, collect insurance information for Proove to be reimbursed, and administer extensive questionnaires to track how the test worked out over time.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to offer our patients a test that could really help them,\u2019\u2019 said Jessica X. Hennessey, director of operations and management at the Center for Mental Health.\n\nThe center received a one-time payment of $600 from Proove for training and is allowed to bill $150 for each hour of clinical research service and services rendered by Littleton staff members related to the study, according to Ernie Corrigan, a spokesman for the center. The Center for Mental Health has billed Proove a little more than $5,600 since then, Corrigan said.\n\nProove officials and Hennessey said clinicians are never compensated based on the type or number of tests they order, and clinicians do not promote the swab test in any way.\n\n\u201cThe tests are only ordered if they are medically necessary,\u201d said Brian Meshkin, Proove\u2019s founder and CEO.\n\nBut the close arrangement raises eyebrows among bioethicists because it can lead to the appearance of clinicians ordering the test to receive compensation for the study.\n\n\u201cThere is a big set of ethical concerns here,\u2019\u2019 said Columbia\u2019s Klitzman, after being told about the Littleton study. He said those concerns are especially pronounced if doctors have financial incentives and \u201corder tests that have no clear proven benefit.\u201d\n\nFederal officials are growing increasingly concerned about such research-physician arrangements in the genetic testing field. Late last year, a large study that included psychiatric drug response by New Orleans-based Renaissance RX was shut down after Medicare halted payments and began a review. A Rhode Island doctor also sued the company, charging, in part, that Renaissance RX enrolled ineligible people in order to bill insurance.\n\nMeanwhile, the Office of the Inspector General for the US Department of Health and Human Services last year singled out compensation agreements related to research studies in a special fraud alert, noting there were growing cases of doctors receiving improper incentives regarding referrals.\n\nThe GeneSight test has gotten the most outside scrutiny among the tests because it faced review by Medicare before the agency agreed to cover it for certain patients with depression.\n\nMedicare contractors were swayed by company-funded studies showing that when these patients took the medications recommended by the test, they had fewer symptoms after eight weeks compared with patients who did not use the test.\n\n\u201cUse of the test to aid in [drug selection] has improved patient responses to treatment by 73 percent . . . these findings support the value of the GeneSight test,\u2019\u2019 according to the coverage decision.\n\nExcitement built in the mental health world that perhaps there was finally a scientific test that could help patients.\n\nBrown heard about the test from his psychiatrist, Susan Gerretson, of the Community Health Centers of the Rutland Region, and found out his federal insurance would pay for it.\n\nWhile his medications of lithium for bipolar disorder and the antidepressant Effexor were holding him steady, he was hardly in a happy place.\n\n\u201cI figured, Why not try it?\u201d he said.\n\nOf the five medications the test suggested he would respond best to, Brown had never tried two of them. After several months of discussion, Gerretson put him on one of those drugs, Fetzima.\n\nEven without the new drug, Brown says it was a challenging time: He turned 40, his old girlfriend called, and he quarreled with his mother.\n\nBut Fetzima \u201cwas a factor\u2019\u2019 in his breakdown, he believes. He paused during an interview this summer at the Brattleboro Retreat, a mental health treatment center, and gave a wry smile. \u201cIt sure didn\u2019t help.\u201d\n\nGerretson declined to talk specifically about Brown\u2019s case, citing privacy concerns. But she said in an e-mail that she believes GeneSight can be helpful as long as a doctor fully understands a patient\u2019s history and conducts his or her own research.\n\n\u201cI never believe what sales representatives try to sell me,\u2019\u2019 she wrote.\n\nYet critics of these tests say it\u2019s impossible for doctors \u2014 or anyone else \u2014 to truly evaluate many of the tests. GeneSight\u2019s proprietary formula for interpreting genetic information has never been independently assessed. The test examines genes well-known to play a role in antidepressant response, but it adds others not suppported by the same level of evidence, some researchers say.\n\nRobert Howland, associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh, wrote a paper last year concluding that the makers of the GeneSight test have overstated the findings of their studies, making outside review more urgent.\n\n\u201cIndependent assessment . . . of the GeneSight test is necessary to overcome the appearance of bias,\u2019\u2019 said Howland.\n\nBut Assurex\u2019s Dechairo said if the company didn\u2019t do the research, no one would. The company has 12 ongoing studies not only for depression, he said, but for bipolar disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia and other medical issues.\n\nTo reach patients, the company markets its tests to the psychiatry world, in part by paying psychiatrists and nurses to talk favorably about their test to peers. The practice is not new in medicine, but, unlike the drug industry, most genetic test makers need not disclose which doctors they pay because they\u2019re not FDA-regulated.\n\nCatherine Poulos, a psychiatric nurse practitioner at East End Mental Health in Hampton Bays, N.Y., advertises the GeneSight test on her website, saying it allows her practice \u201cto use the right drug at the right dose.\u201d But nowhere does it say on the site that she is paid to speak favorably to peers about the test; a patient would have to look at her Linkedin profile to see that. Poulos declined to speak on the record to NECIR.\n\nBut some consultants who use the tests say they do so because they believe in it, not because they get paid.\n\n\u201cIt adds clarity,\u2019\u2019 said Chris Bojrab, a psychiatrist and president of Indiana Health Group, a large behavioral health practice and a GeneSight consultant. He discloses his financial relationship with GeneSight on his website.\n\nThe FDA loophole that allows unregulated tests on the market dates back more than three decades to when the FDA began regulating diagnostic tests. At the time, the agency exempted what was then a small group of tests that were developed, manufactured, and used in a single lab, such as in a hospital.\n\nStarting in the mid-2000s, for-profit companies have used the exemption to develop thousands of complex genetic tests now in the marketplace without FDA review.\n\nThe FDA announced plans last year to regulate these tests over the next nine years. However, there is no timeline to finalize the rules, according to an FDA spokeswoman, and the process is likely to take years.\n\nCommercial labs and academic institutions are pushing back against regulation, arguing the rules will stifle innovation and delay life-saving tests getting to patients. Regardless of the outcome of the fight, many academic scientists say this new era in testing needs independent study. They question if the tests are adding unnecessary costs to health care.\n\n\u201cThese companies look at a very small subset of a very large number of factors\u2019\u2019 that go into treating patients, said Bruce Cohen, a psychiatry professor at Harvard Medical School and director of the program for neuropsychiatric research at McLean Hospital in Belmont. \u201cPeople are making decisions based on unproven tests.\u201d\n\nBrown\u2019s decision was to go back to old medications. For him, the GeneSight test felt more like \u201ca cool piece of science fiction\u201d than a breakthrough. Still living in his mother\u2019s house, he remains determined to rebuild his life.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to figure it out another way,\u201d he said.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story makes clear that many of these tests are currently available.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Antidepressant drugs really do work, a major new international study has proven.

The research was an early-stage study, conducted to test the side effects and best dosage of a potential new combined therapy, and the findings were published today in the journal Cancer Discovery.\n\nPembrolizumab, which is marketed under the brand name Keytruda, works by blocking a protein called PD-1, which interferes with immune system function. Blocking PD-1 with pembrolizumab enables the immune system cells to better attack the cancer. While pembrolizumab has been a significant advancement for treating people with a variety of advanced or metastatic cancers, a majority of metastatic melanoma tumors are still resistant to the drug.\n\n\"We have found that the reason patients with metastatic melanoma do not initially respond to immunotherapy with an anti-PD-1 is that their immune system was not ready,\" said Dr. Antoni Ribas, the study's lead author, a professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and director of the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center Tumor Immunology Program. \"So we thought, 'What if we change that by injecting the therapy drug into the metastatic lesions and change the microenvironment of the cancer?'\n\n\"It's like having a pile of wood but not having a match to light it. With this new approach, SD-101 is the match that starts the fire.\"\n\nThe researchers found that SD-101 not only directs T cells to cancer cells, but it also makes the microenvironment more hospitable for the T cells, so that they can better kill the cancer cells.\n\nAll 22 people in the study had an advanced stage of inoperable or metastatic melanoma. Nine were receiving an immunotherapy treatment for the first time as part of the study. Seven of those nine had a positive response to the drug combination, including two for whom the tumors disappeared completely.\n\nThe other 13 people in the study had previously received a type of immunotherapy before the study. Of them, two had a partial response, meaning parts of the tumors shrank, but the tumors did not go away completely. Five more showed some reduction in the tumors, but the other participants did respond to the therapy.\n\nThe results of the study suggest that the combination of pembrolizumab and SD-101 could provide an alternative treatment for people with melanoma whose tumors have not responded or would be unlikely to respond to other therapies.\n\n\"For all patients with advanced cancer, immunotherapy using PD-1 inhibitors has really changed the face of cancer treatment. Unfortunately, this therapy still only works in a subset of patients,\" said Dr. Deborah Wong, assistant clinical professor of medicine at the Geffen School of Medicine and an oncologist at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, who was also an author of the paper.\n\n\"This particular combination has been especially gratifying because not only does the SD-101 therapy drug induce tumor shrinkage at the actual site where it's injected, but it's working in conjunction with pembrolizumab to shrink tumors outside of the ones we're directly injecting.\"\n\nThe study highlights the need for more research into combination therapies like this one, because many people with cancer do not respond to immunotherapy or experience a reoccurrence of their tumors after treatment.\n\n\"We are really starting to understand the science of how immunotherapies work in patients,\" said Ribas, who is also the director of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy Center at UCLA. \"By understanding that, we can find more ways to make that therapy more active.

The new drug stabilizes dopamine signaling in areas of the brain that control movement and coordination.\n\nAccording to the study authors, this is the first drug shown to improve patients' loss of ability to move their muscles voluntarily. The only drug currently approved for Huntington's is tetrabenazine, which treats only involuntary movements and can cause serious side effects.\n\nThe results of the phase 3 clinical trial, conducted by Spanish researchers led by Dr. Justo Garcia de Yebenes, of the department of neurology, Hospital Ramon y Cajal in Madrid, appear in the Nov. 7 online edition of The Lancet Neurology.\n\nThe study included 437 Huntington's disease patients from eight European countries. The participants took either pridopidine (45 milligrams once daily or 45 mg twice daily) or a placebo for 26 weeks.\n\nAfter six months of treatment, patients taking the higher dose of pridopidine showed improvements in motor function -- specifically in eye and hand movements, involuntary muscle contractions (dystonia), and gait and balance -- compared with patients taking the placebo.\n\nMore than 70 percent of the patients taking the higher dose of the drug showed a significant benefit, according to the researchers. Side effects among patients taking the drug were similar to the placebo group.\n\n\"Pridopidine has the potential to complement available treatments by improving a different range of motor deficits. Its lack of severe side-effects . . . suggests that pridopidine might be useful even for those patients who are treated at sites that are not centers of excellence for Huntington's disease,\" the researchers concluded.\n\nOne U.S. neurologist agreed that the drug seems promising against a disease with few treatment options.\n\n\"There has been a great deal of attention for this drug, as it is one of the few molecules that in preliminary studies was found to have some efficacy in Huntington's disease,\" said Dr. Alessandro Di Rocco, professor in the department of neurology and chief of the division of movement disorders at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City.\n\n\"However, this is the first large study to show evidence of a positive result in treating the motor symptoms of this devastating disease. And, though the compound is apparently well tolerated without significant side effects, the benefit is modest and limited to the motor symptoms of the disease and it is unknown how long the improvement observed could last,\" he added.\n\nStill, pridopidine does not get at the underlying cause of Huntington's disease, Di Rocco said.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Huntington's is a progressive disease and this drug is not a treatment of the disease itself but only improves some of its symptoms,\" he explained. \"Nevertheless, it is a welcome addition because there is very little else yet available to treat the symptoms. The challenge for scientists and clinicians is to discover therapies that actually slows or halts the progression of the disease.\"\n\nAnother expert agreed that new treatment options for patients are sorely needed.\n\n\"A well-tolerated drug that produces even small benefits for patients with Huntington's disease would be a very welcome addition to the currently available treatments for this debilitating disorder,\" Andrew Feigin, from The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in New York City, wrote in an accompanying commentary.\n\nThe study was funded by European pharmaceuticals company NeuroSearch A/S.\n\nWe Move has more about Huntington's disease.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story mentions that study results are from a phase III clinical trial, but it does not clearly comment on the availability of pridopidine, or the class of dopidine drugs in general.

It is expected to be available as an inexpensive, over-the-counter product.\n\nOutdoor air pollution is a global health crisis that kills over 3 million people a year and it has long been linked to lung and heart disease and strokes. But research is also uncovering new impacts on health, including degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s, mental illness and, this week, diabetes.\n\nThe impact of air pollution costs $5tn a year, according to a World Bank report published last week. In the UK, at least 40,000 people a year die prematurely from air pollution, with a cross-party committee of MPs calling it a \u201cpublic health emergency\u201d.\n\nBut the government\u2019s plans to tackle the issue were heavily criticised this week, just as alerts were issued for extreme air pollution across much of northern England. A day later, it was announced that more ambitious plans for London from Mayor Sadiq Khan were overwhelmingly backed by the public.\n\nVehicles are a key contributor to air pollution but, a year after the VW emissions scandal broke, most new diesel cars still emit far more toxic nitrogen oxides on the road than the official lab-based limit.\n\nAction to clean up air is urgently needed across the world, but cutting emissions for vehicles and other sources will take years, meaning ways to reduce the harm in the meantime could be vital. The new inhaler has been developed by German medical devices company Bitop and is based on a molecule called ectoine, discovered in the 1980s in a desert bacterium which uses the compound to conserve water in 60C heat.\n\n\u201cIt is quite an inert molecule that does one main thing, which is bind water, which stabilises cell membrane tissues against physical or chemical damage,\u201d said Dr Andreas Bilstein, at Bitop. \u201cIt supports the natural barrier.\u201d\n\nWhen inhaled, this helps prevent the damage caused by air pollution particles that can lead to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer, Bilstein said: \u201cDamage cannot occur as strongly and there is less inflammatory response, and so disease progression is reduced. The perfect situation is that the patient inhales in the morning and evening at home.\u201d\n\nThe inhaler has been tested in three small groups of patients particularly at risk from air pollution, due to asthma, COPD and bronchitis, with the positive results due to be published soon, Bilstein said.\n\nEctoine does not interact with cell receptors, so it is classed as a medical device rather than a drug. This means large clinical trials are not required for official approval and the inhaler could be on sale soon, at an estimated cost of \u00a317 a month, after Bitop selects a marketing partner. A version of the product for use in nebulisers will be available this year in Germany and Poland, while an ectoine-based nasal spray for allergy relief is already available.\n\nBilstein said the inhaler could be useful around the world, as particulate air pollution is not just a European problem: \u201cEspecially in Asia \u2013 China in particular \u2013 the demand for such a product is even higher. I was in New York last week, and the air was also not very clean.\u201d\n\nThe protective effect of ectoine was discovered by Prof Jean Krutmann and colleagues at the Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine, while investigating whether the molecule could protect skin against sun damage. Bitop funded a series of studies, now published in prominent scientific journals.\n\n\u201cThe point that it can prevent the lung inflammation induced by ultrafine particles is established \u2013 there is no more doubt,\u201d Krutmann said. Antioxidants can also provide some protection but there has been controversy over the effectiveness of such food supplements, he said: \u201cPersonally, I think it is much better to eat lots of vegetables and fruit rather than taking any supplements.\u201d\n\nDr Richard Russell, a consultant respiratory physician in the NHS and medical advisor to the British Lung Foundation, who was not involved in the research, said the inhaler was both credible and promising: \u201cEctoine is a beautifully elegant molecule and it clearly works by helping water to stabilise, giving you a film of water in times of stress.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe work that has been published thus far, in credible, internationally recognised journals, show that this stuff has positive properties, protecting against triggered inflammation,\u201d he told the Guardian. Russell, who also lectures at Imperial College and Oxford University, said it might also be useful for the treatment of asthma, COPD and other lung diseases, not only prevention. \u201cIt could potentially do so much more.

Some days the pain is so bad, she says, \"By 11 o'clock in the morning, I'm on the couch in a darkened room with my head packed in ice.\"\n\nOver the years, Bradford, who is 50 years old and lives in Bedford, Mass., has searched desperately for pain relief. She's been to the doctor countless times for countless tests. \"Everything I've had, I've had twice,\" she says. \"I've had two spinal taps; I've had so many nerve blocks I've lost count.\"\n\nBradford is not alone. It's estimated that every year 12 million Americans go to the doctor seeking help for headaches. Nearly one quarter of the population suffers from recurrent severe tension headaches or migraines.\n\nPeople who go to the doctor for headaches are increasingly likely to be sent for advanced testing and treatment, a study finds. That testing is expensive, it may not be necessary and it could even be harmful, says lead researcher Dr. John Mafi, of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.\n\nMafi looked at the rates of advanced imaging like CT scans and MRIs in people with headaches, as well as referrals to other doctors, presumably specialists. He found that from 1999 to 2010, the number of diagnostic tests rose from 6.7 percent of all doctor visits to 13.9 percent. At the same time, referrals to other doctors increased from 6.9 percent to 13.2 percent. In other words, almost double what it was a decade ago.\n\nMafi says this isn't because more people are suffering headaches. The headache rate has remained virtually the same over the past decade. But what has changed is supply and demand. Today there are a lot more advanced diagnostic machines than there were a decade ago, and more patients are asking to be tested.\n\n\"Patients are more assertive than ever before,\" Mafi says. \"They do research online, are more informed and sometimes go to the doctor demanding, 'I think I need an MRI.' \"\n\nAnd while an informed patient is a good thing, Mafi says sometimes the patient gets it wrong. \"I think there's a subconscious perception that more is better, and that fancier, more expensive tests are better and that equals better care.\"\n\nMafi's study did not include patients with tumors or other serious problems that can cause headaches. He only looked at otherwise healthy patients who suffered chronic headaches. And in these cases, repeated diagnostic testing can lead to further unnecessary procedures like biopsies.\n\nOn top of that, exposure to radiation in tests like CT scans adds up over time and can increase the risk of certain cancers.\n\nFor Terri Bradford, the years of searching for effective treatment proved futile. \"I've been to four neurologists. A lot of them have given up on me because I haven't gotten any better,\" she says.\n\nEventually Bradford ended up at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where neurologist Carolyn Bernstein directs the Comprehensive Headache Center. Bernstein says she sees lots of desperate patients like Bradford. \"The majority of them have really been suffering a number of years and they're really miserable with the pain,\" Bernstein says. They say, \" 'I hope you have a magic pill,' and of course there is no magic pill.\"\n\nThere is just no single reason why people get chronic headaches, although we do know that migraines have a genetic component and usually a trigger. \"If you are a migraine sufferer and I expose you to the right trigger, you're going to have a migraine,\" Bernstein says.\n\nBut the triggers are different for different people. They can include poor diet, too much sugar or certain types of alcohol. Problems sleeping, stress, lack of exercise or a combination of any number of these things can cause chronic headaches.\n\nAt the headache center, patients receive a thorough medical history that includes headache patterns, disability and mood assessments. Then the center works with patients to try to identify what triggers their headaches and how they can avoid those triggers in the future.\n\nSome people find relief through exercise. \"I write an exercise prescription probably as often as I write a prescription for medication,\" Bernstein says. She acknowledges it's sometimes difficult to encourage a patient with cracking head pain to get up and exercise. But even a little can help, and according to Bernstein it doesn't have to be jogging for miles and miles. It can be yoga, tai chi or even just a little stretching.\n\nA big lifestyle adjustment worked for Terri Bradford. She started exercising and changed her diet, giving up gluten, dairy and sugar. And she learned how to meditate to reduce stress. All these changes, she says, have made a huge difference. She has far fewer headaches and when she does have them, they're far less severe. \"I'm finally healing,\" she says.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "If the concept is that lifestyle changes are effective at treating migraines, then it is assumed that people can change their diets or exercise more no matter where they live.

Now he and his colleagues are testing to see whether hip patients also can benefit from it.\n\nIt is much less invasive than a knee or hip replacement, and typically is performed on an outpatient basis, Vasileff said.\n\nThe procedure involves a smaller incision than joint replacement surgery, so there's less risk of infection, and a quicker recovery time that means fewer of the side effects associated with being bedridden, Vasileff said.\n\nHowever, subchondroplasty is only feasible in a narrow range of patients. Those with full-blown bone-on-bone arthritis or joint pain caused by damage to the cartilage and ligaments will get little to no relief from the procedure, Vasileff said.\n\n\"People who have significant arthritis where the cartilage itself is damaged and thinned, this isn't going to fix the arthritis,\" Vasileff said. \"But there are some people who may have some issues with the bone and mild arthritis. In these patients who might otherwise have needed a knee or hip replacement to deal with that, this could be an alternative.\"\n\nSoftware engineer Ben Wallace underwent subchondroplasty in November to help shore up a damaged hip.\n\n\"The end of September I noticed I was really struggling to move around my left leg very well,\" said Wallace, who lives in Columbus, Ohio. Imaging scans revealed a hip in very bad shape, with a misshapen femur.\n\nA five-hour surgery cleaned up the femur and bolstered the bone with cement.\n\n\"It's been going really great. I'm better than what they expected. One week after surgery I was off the crutches, walking on my own,\" Wallace said.\n\n\"I figured I'm going to have a fake hip in there at the age of 30, which was very depressing,\" Wallace explained. \"The fact I was able to keep all my bones and joints in there was quite a surprise.\"\n\nSubchondroplasty has shown solid potential, but orthopedic surgeon Dr. Matthew Hepinstall is concerned that it might be \"oversold\" to desperate patients who want to avoid joint replacement surgery.\n\n\"The claims that are being made are not evidence-based yet, although they are intellectually appealing,\" said Hepinstall. He is associate director of the Center for Joint Preservation & Reconstruction at Lenox Hill Hospital, in New York City.\n\n\"It's just important not to oversell this,\" he added.\n\nThe best candidates for the procedure are patients who still have some cartilage protecting their joint, but have somehow \"overloaded\" and injured the bone, causing swelling and pain, Hepinstall said.\n\n\"If you inject this substance into the bone, you're basically providing internal support, a scaffold protecting the bone. That can theoretically reduce bone pain,\" Hepinstall noted.\n\n\"The appealing thing about it is instead of going in and resurfacing a damaged joint, you're injecting something to help the bone, but keeping the patient's own anatomy,\" Hepinstall continued.\n\n\"But there's a very narrow window of patients who are good ideal candidates for this, who basically have a real overload of their bone causing severe enough pain to warrant a surgical procedure, but also have healthy enough cartilage that doing something about the bone swelling is going to alleviate the majority of their pain,\" he stressed.\n\n\"We don't want to send the message to people who have bone-on-bone, with big bone spurs and limited range of motion that they're all of a sudden going to get relief from injecting a little bit of cement into their bone,\" Hepinstall said. \"This is for people who have basically a normal joint that has normal range of motion and normal stability, just a little thinning of the cartilage.\"\n\nFor more on knee pain, visit the Arthritis Foundation.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Bone cement procedures seem to be widely available for vertebral compression fractures, but it is not clear from this story or an internet search whether access to a bone cement procedure for knee and/or hip pain is still very limited or relatively accessible.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "DALLAS, Aug. 22, 2018 -- Breastfeeding is not only good for babies, there is growing evidence it may also reduce the risk for stroke in post-menopausal women who reported breastfeeding at least one child, according to new research in Journal of the American Heart Association, the Open Access Journal of the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association.\n\nStroke is the fourth leading cause of death among women aged 65 and older, and is the third leading cause of death among Hispanic and black women aged 65 and older, according to the study.\n\n\"Some studies have reported that breastfeeding may reduce the rates of breast cancer, ovarian cancer and risk of developing Type 2 diabetes in mothers. Recent findings point to the benefits of breastfeeding on heart disease and other specific cardiovascular risk factors,\" said Lisette T. Jacobson, Ph.D., M.P.A., M.A., lead author of the study and assistant professor in the department of preventive medicine and public health at the University of Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita.\n\nThis is among the first studies to examine breastfeeding and a possible relationship to stroke risk for mothers, as well as how such a relationship might vary by ethnicity.\n\nResearchers analyzed data on 80,191 participants in the Women's Health Initiative observational study, a large ongoing national study that has tracked the medical events and health habits of postmenopausal women who were recruited between 1993 and 1998. All women in this analysis had delivered one or more children and 58 percent reported ever having breastfed. Among these women, 51 percent breastfed for one-six months, 22 percent for seven-12 months and 27 percent for 13 or more months. At the time of recruitment, the average age was 63.7 years and the follow-up period was 12.6 years.\n\nAfter adjusting for non-modifiable stroke risk factors (such as age and family history), researchers found stroke risk among women who breastfed their babies was on average:\n\u2022 19 percent lower in women who had breastfed for up to six months. A longer reported length of breastfeeding was associated with a greater reduction in risk.\n\n\"If you are pregnant, please consider breastfeeding as part of your birthing plan and continue to breastfeed for at least six months to receive the optimal benefits for you and your infant,\" Jacobson said.\n\n\"Our study did not address whether racial/ethnic differences in breastfeeding contribute to disparities in stroke risk. Additional research should consider the degree to which breastfeeding might alter racial/ethnic differences in stroke risk,\" Jacobson said.\n\nBecause the study was observational, it couldn't establish a cause-and-effect relationship between breastfeeding and lower stroke risk, meaning that it is possible some other characteristic that distinguishes between women who breastfeed and those who don't is the factor changing the stroke risk. However, because the Women's Health Initiative is large, researchers were able to adjust for many characteristics, and the effects of breastfeeding remained strong, Jacobson said.\n\n\"Breastfeeding is only one of many factors that could potentially protect against stroke. Others include getting adequate exercise, choosing healthy foods, not smoking and seeking treatment if needed to keep your blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar in the normal range,\" Jacobson said.\n\nThe study was also limited by the relatively small number of strokes that occurred during the follow-up period (just 3.4 percent of the women experienced a stroke during the study period and 1.6 percent reported having had a stroke prior to the study) and by the Women's Health Initiative's exclusion of women who had already had severe strokes at the time of recruitment.\n\nCurrently, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend exclusive breastfeeding for six months, with continuation of breast feeding for one year or longer. For babies health, the American Heart Association recommends breastfeeding for 12 months with transition to other additional sources of nutrients beginning at about four - six months of age to ensure sufficient micronutrients in the diet.\n\nFrontiers: The Heartland Institute for Clinical and Translational Research and the Wichita Center for Graduate Medical Education-Kansas Bioscience Authority funded the study.

In contrast, the historical OS rate with standard of care concurrent chemotherapy and traditional radiation was 16 months at the time when the study was designed.\n\nThe findings are the final results of the single institution, Phase II study and represent the longest follow-up to date of stage 3 lung cancer patients who have received proton therapy, said Joe Y. Chang, M.D., professor, Radiation Oncology and the study's corresponding author.\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women in the U.S. According to the American Cancer Society, more than 222,500 people will be diagnosed and 155,870 will die from the disease in 2017, with the majority of patients still being diagnosed when the disease is in an advanced stage.\n\n\"Advanced lung cancer patients with inoperable disease traditionally have been treated with concurrent chemotherapy and conventional photon radiation therapy. However, the therapy can be very difficult for patients due to associated toxicities and because many patients are also dealing with comorbidities,\" explained Chang.\n\nProton therapy is an advanced type of radiation treatment that uses a beam of protons to deliver radiation directly to the tumor, destroying cancer cells while sparing healthy tissues. Protons enter the body with a low radiation dose and stop at the tumor, matching its shape and volume or depth. They deposit the bulk of their cancer-fighting energy right at the tumor, thereby reducing the dose to cardiopulmonary structures, which impacts the toxicity, functional status, quality of life and even survival for patients, explained Chang.\n\n\"With our study, we hypothesized that proton therapy would offer a survival benefit to patients and reduce treatment-associated toxicities, which can be very serious,\" he said.\n\nThe study opened at MD Anderson in 2006; in this research, Chang and his colleague report on the study's five-year results.\n\nFor the prospective Phase II trial, 64 patients with inoperable, Stage III non-small-cell lung cancer were enrolled. The study's primary endpoint was OS. The researchers hypothesized that the median OS would increase from historical data of 16 months on standard therapy to 24 months. Secondary endpoints included distant metastasis and local and regional recurrence rates. Toxic effects of treatment in both the acute and late settings also were analyzed.\n\nMedian follow up was 27.3 months for all patients, and 79.6 months for alive patients. At five years, the median OS was 26.5 months, and the corresponding five-year OS was 29 percent. Median progression-free survival was 12.9 months, with a five-year progression-free survival of 22 percent.\n\nIn sum, 39 patients experienced a relapse, with distant sites representing 62 percent of all recurrences. Local and regional recurrence rates were low, 16 percent and 14 percent, respectively.\n\nAmong the acute and late toxic effects diagnosed in patients were: esophagitis, pneumonitis and cardiac arrhythmia. Of note, said Chang, no patients developed the most severe, or grade five, toxicities, as seen in patients who receive standard of care.\n\nChang noted his study is not without limitations. Of greatest significance: the study was designed more than a decade ago. While the study's survival, recurrence rates and toxic effects are still favorable when compared to rates associated with the most advanced traditional photon radiation therapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), technology to diagnose and stage the disease, as well all treatment modalities have significantly improved.\n\n\"When the study opened, PET imaging had just been approved for lung cancer staging. The image quality was poor and didn't include a CT component in most facilities across the country,\" said Chang. \"Obviously, the technology has improved dramatically over the last decade and has made a significant impact on diagnosis and staging. Also, delivery of both the conventional intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and proton therapy (IMPT), have improved, thereby reducing side effects for both treatment modalities.\"\n\nFor example, MD Anderson proton therapy patients with advanced lung cancer now can receive IMPT. The technique uses an intricate network of magnets to aim a narrow proton beam at a tumor and \"paint\" the radiation dose onto it layer by layer. Healthy tissue surrounding the tumor is spared, and side effects are even more reduced than earlier proton delivery, said Chang.\n\nChang also noted the advancements in cancer biology and immunotherapy and that both are important areas of research focus in combination with proton therapy.\n\nIn addition to Chang, other authors on the all-MD Anderson study include: Stephen Hahn, M.D., Ritsuko Komaki, M.D., Pamela K.

The NHS, however, needs to get the support of surgeons, many of whom rarely carry out the less invasive procedure.\n\nPartial replacements, also known as unicompartmental replacements, are suitable for people who have arthritis in just one side of the knee, usually the inner. They can be carried out with a smaller incision using minimally invasive surgery, but they are only suitable for people whose ligaments inside the knee are strong.\n\n\n\nResearchers from the Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS) publishing in the BMJ Open journal found that the less invasive procedure was being used less than it could be.\n\nThe main reason for the surgery is osteoarthritis. About half of all patients should be suitable for a partial replacement, but an analysis of data routinely collected by the National Joint Registry showed that of 98,147 knee replacements undertaken in 2016, only 9% were partial.\n\n\u201cThe main strength of this study is that we were able to use real data, from very large numbers of people, about their actual operations, their GP visit, and their own reported quality of life outcomes in a way that is not always possible,\u201d said Dr Rafael Pinedo-Villanueva, the co-lead researcher and NDORMS senior health economist, who is funded by the National Institute of Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre and the Medical Research Council.\n\n\u201cThis has allowed us to provide strong proof that partial knee replacements are both better for patients and cheaper for the NHS.\u201d\n\nWhether people had a partial or total replacement varied by surgeon, as did the success of the operation, the researchers discovered.

All participants had maintained their current weight for six months leading up to the study and did not exercise regularly. One group of men followed the diet, which reduced calorie consumption by about one-third of their individual needs, for 16 weeks straight. The experimental group stuck to the eating plan for two weeks, before ditching the diet for two weeks. They repeated the cycle until they had also dieted for 16 weeks; however, in their case, each bout of restriction was followed by a period of eating enough calories for weight maintenance.\n\nAt the end of the study, the men following the intermittent diet plan lost 47 percent more weight than the control group. And while it\u2019s common to regain a few pounds after returning to previous eating habits, the two-week dieters kept the pounds off, maintaining a nearly 18-pound loss six months after the study.\n\nKrista Varady, an outside researcher who studies intermittent fasting (not the same as intermittent dieting) and weight loss at the University of Illinois, believes the results were significant.\n\n\"I was really impressed that they still saw almost a two kilogram weight loss during that last period at the end of the four months,\" she tells Newsweek. \"At that point we see almost zero weight loss,\" she explains of her own research. \"Somehow they\u2019re kind of keeping the body on its toes.\"\n\nThis trick may help combat the dreaded weight loss plateau that plagues dieters looking to lose those last five pounds.

While the procedure cannot cure mesothelioma, it can help control the buildup of fluid, improve breathing and lessen cancer pain. Dr. Vigneswaran and colleagues administered a cancer quality-of-life survey known as the EORTC QLQ-C30 to 114 mesothelioma patients who underwent PD surgery. The median age was 70, with a range of 50 to 88. Prior to surgery, 31 percent of the patients had a performance status score of 0 (fully functional); 65 percent had a performance status score of 1 (able to do light house work or office work); and 4 percent had a performance status of 2 (ambulatory and capable of self-care, but unable to work). Following surgery, all patients were surveyed at 1 month, 4-5 months, 7-8 months and 10-11 months.\n\nThe quality of life survey measured overall functioning (physical, emotional, cognitive, etc.); general symptoms (fatigue, nausea/vomiting and pain); individual items (shortness of breath, diarrhea, insomnia, constipation and financial difficulties) and overall health.\n\nImproved quality of life was observed in the first month after surgery and was maintained at late follow-up in all patients. Quality of life was not adversely affected by surgery at any time in patients who, prior to surgery, had performance status of 1 or 2; a tumor volume greater than 600 ml. or a type of tumor cell called non-epithelioid.\n\n\u201cThe net benefit of pleurectomy and decortication justifies the procedure in the majority of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma,\u201d Dr. Vigneswaran concluded.\n\nThe study is titled \u201cQuality of Life in Patients Undergoing Pleurectomy and Decortication for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma.\u201d The surgeries were performed by Dr. Vigneswaran at University of Chicago Medicine, where he practiced before recently joining Loyola.", "question": "Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "We rated this as satisfactory, but just barely.

This may be especially true for people with serious mental illness, a study finds. When people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder were asked who or what helped them manage the condition, many said it was pets that helped the most.\n\n\"When I'm feeling really low they are wonderful because they won't leave my side for two days,\" one study participant with two dogs and two cats, \"They just stay with me until I am ready to come out of it.\"\n\nAnother person said of their pet birds: \"If I didn't have my pets I think I would be on my own. You know what I mean, so it's \u2014 it's nice to come home and, you know, listen to the birds singing and that, you know.\"\n\nMany people with serious mental illness live at home and have limited contact with the health care system, says Helen Brooks, a mental health researcher at University of Manchester in the United Kingdom and the lead author on the study, which was published Friday in the journal BMC Psychiatry. So they're doing a lot of the work of managing their conditions.\n\nBrooks says, \"Many felt deep emotional connections with their pet that weren't available from friends and family.\"\n\nBrooks and her colleagues interviewed 54 people with serious long-term mental illnesses. Twenty-five of them considered their pets to be a part of their social network. The scientists asked who they went to when they needed help or advice, where they gained emotional support and encouragement and how they spent their days.\n\nThe participants were then given a diagram with three consecutive circles radiating out from a square representing the participant. They were asked to write the people, places and things that gave them support into the circles, with the circles closest to the center being the most important.\n\nSixty percent of the people who considered pets to be a part of their social networks placed them in the central, most important circle \u2014 the same place many people put close family and social workers. 20 percent placed pets in the second circle.\n\nThe interviews with participants are poignant, and reveal the struggle and isolation that can come with mental illness.\n\n\"I think it's really hard when you haven't had a mental illness to know what the actual experience is [like],\" said one participant. \"There's like a chasm, deep chasm between us ... [Other people are] on one side of it, and we're on the other side of it. We're sending smoke signals to each other to try and understand each other but we don't always \u2014 we don't always understand.\"\n\nPeople with mental illnesses often see their social groups shrink and find themselves alienated from their friends. For many of these people, says Brooks, animals can break through the isolation. They give affection without needing to understand the disorder.\n\n\"[Pets] don't look at the scars on your arms,\" one participant said. \"They don't question where you've been.\"\n\nThe pets provided more than just emotional support and companionship, participants said. The animals also could distract them from their illness, even from severe psychosis.\n\nOne study participant placed birds in his closest social circle. When he was hearing voices, he said that they \"help me in the sense, you know, I'm not thinking about the voices, I'm just thinking of when I hear the birds singing.\"\n\nAnother participant said that merely seeing a hamster climbing the bars on the cage and acting cute helped with some difficult situations.\n\nAnd having to take care of pets keeps people from withdrawing from the world. \"They force me, the cats force me to sort of still be involved,\" said one participant.\n\nAnother said that walking the dog helped them get out of the house and with people. \"That surprised me, you know, the amount of people that stop and talk to him, and that, yeah, it cheers me up with him. I haven't got much in my life, but he's quite good, yeah.\"\n\n\"The routine these pets provide is really important for people,\" says Brooks. \"Getting up in the morning to feed them and groom them and walk them, giving them structure and a sense of purpose that they won't otherwise have.\"\n\nMany of the study participants are unemployed because of their illness, she notes. Having a pet that was well taken care of was a source of pride for them.\n\nMark Longsjo, the program director of adult services at McLean Southeast, an inpatient mental facility in Middleborough, Mass., says that the interviews in the study reflect his professional experiences. \"We have so many patients come through, and we always ask them about their support system. Sometimes its family members, sometimes its friends, but it's very common to hear about pets.\"\n\nWhen he does patient intake surveys, Longsjo says that he includes pets in their risk assessments. Patients with pets often say the animals help keep them from following through on suicidal thinking, because they know their pets depend on them.\n\nThe social workers at McLean also incorporate pets into their aftercare planning, encouraging patients to make walking and grooming their pets a part of their routine. \"I think there's significant value in considering the common everyday pet to be as important as the relationships one has with one's family in the course of their treatment,\" says Longsjo. He feels this study is important because, although there's a lot of work looking at the benefits of trained therapy animals, they can be expensive and out of the reach of many patients.\n\nBrooks hopes that more health workers will consider incorporating pets into care plans for people with mental illness. Many of her participants said that sometimes it felt like their pets could sense when they needed help the most, and were able to provide it \u2014 just like the owners took care of them.\n\nAs one person in the study said, \"When he comes up and sits beside you on a night, it's different, you know. It's just, like, he needs me as much as I need him.\"", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "We\u2019re going to act under the assumption that readers are familiar with the idea of pet ownership.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "After three years, teens with severe obesity who underwent stomach reduction surgery to lose weight also significantly improved their heart health.\n\nA study published Monday in Pediatrics shows that blood pressure, cholesterol, inflammation and insulin levels all improved, particularly among those who lost the most weight.\n\n\"The potential impact of such risk reduction translates into a reduced likelihood of developing significant heart disease later in life, including atherosclerosis, heart failure and stroke,\" says study author Marc Michalsky, surgical director of the Center for Healthy Weight and Nutrition at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, in an email. \"This study serves to reinforce the benefits of bariatric surgery as a safe and effective treatment strategy that should be considered sooner rather than later.\"\n\nYounger adolescents in the study showed bigger improvements in their cholesterol and inflammation levels than the older teens. Even participants who had normal-range blood pressure, triglycerides or cholesterol levels before surgery saw improved measures.\n\nNearly a third of all children and teens are overweight or obese in the U.S., and an estimated 4 to 7 percent have severe obesity. The greater a person's obesity, the greater their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and organ damage.\n\nThe findings are important because many of the participants in this study likely already had some level of cardiac damage, such as thickened arteries or heart walls, says Geetha Raghuveer, a pediatric cardiologist at Children's Mercy Kansas City in Missouri who was not involved in the study.\n\n\"If you have very high blood pressure or lipids [cholesterol] or diabetes, you do see cardiovascular changes even at a very young age,\" Raghuveer says. \"They may not be having a heart attack or stroke in their teens and 20s, but they're closer to having those in their 30s and 40s.\"\n\nAmong 242 teens in the study, 161 of them underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure, 67 underwent a vertical sleeve gastrectomy and 14 received an adjustable gastric banding. The study authors had no part in which procedures the teens received. They collected data from the five participating medical centers for their observational study, and decisions about procedures depended on each center's clinical practices.\n\nThe teens, ages 15 to 18 when the study began, had a body mass index (BMI) between 34 and 88, with half over 51. Medical providers use BMI, the ratio of a person's weight to height, to estimate body fat. A BMI over 25 is considered overweight; over 30 is obese. The obesity classification with the highest risks of health problems is a BMI of 40 or higher.\n\nThe risk factors measured in the study included elevated blood pressure (above 120/80 mg/Hg), high cholesterol, high insulin levels in the blood and abnormally high levels of C-reactive protein, an indicator of inflammation in the body. The higher a person's insulin levels are, the more likely they are to have or develop insulin resistance, which can increase blood sugar levels and diabetes risk. High insulin levels may also contribute to increased blood pressure and increase the risk of atherosclerosis, when fat clogs the arteries.\n\nThree years after surgery, teens who underwent a gastric bypass had a 27 percent drop in their BMI, similar to the 26 percent drop in those who had the sleeve gastrectomy. Those with the gastric band had an 8 percent drop in BMI.\n\nBefore surgery, only 3 percent of the teens had no cardiac risk factors at all, but three years later, just over half of them (52 percent) had no risk factors. Just 5 percent had all four cardiac risk factors before their surgeries, but none had all of them three years later. In fact, the majority of the participants \u2014 83 percent \u2014 had only one or no risk factors three years after their surgeries. The proportion of participants with two or three risk factors also dropped substantially.\n\n\"One of the surprises was that almost all patients benefited as a result of the surgery,\" says M. James Lenhard, the medical director of Christiana Care Health System's Diabetes & Metabolic Diseases Center in Wilmington, Del., who was not involved in the study. The average BMI three years after surgery was 39, still considered very obese, he says. \"And yet they still had significant improvements in cardiovascular risk factors,\" Lenhard says. \"The results were impressive.\"\n\nThe study's biggest limitation is its very selective population. Most of the participants were female, most were white, and most received the gastric bypass. Children of color have the greatest risk of obesity, heart disease and Type 2 diabetes, but it's not clear whether they would see the same improvement with these procedures. Lenhard expects the \"odds are very good\" that they would, and Raghuveer \"would be cautiously optimistic\" that the findings would be similar regardless of sex or ethnicity.\n\nThe population also included only teens with the greatest obesity who were also unsuccessful trying other weight loss methods.\n\n\"Severe obesity is notoriously difficult to treat with anything other than surgery,\" Lenhard says. \"The results of this study suggest that performing surgery at a BMI even lower than 52 would provide even better outcomes.\"\n\nAn estimated 1,600 adolescents undergo metabolic or bariatric surgeries each year, the study notes, but families should only consider such procedures after exhausting other treatment options.\n\n\"This is not a procedure you would consider for any obese patient who walks through the door,\" Raghuveer says. \"It would be considered for the highly obese and those not responding to any behavioral modifications, physical activity or calorie restriction.\"\n\nBefore undergoing bariatric surgery, teens and their families receive extensive counseling, Michalsky says.\n\n\"Teens considering bariatric surgery should have a frank discussion with their family and primary care provider and seek detailed information from well-established bariatric surgery centers that are specifically dedicated to treating adolescents,\" he adds.\n\nAll three procedures carry the same risks as any surgical procedure, such as infections, blood clots and bleeding, Lenhard said, and a common risk of sleeve gastrectomy is bleeding where the stomach is reconnected. People who have a gastric bypass often have nutritional and vitamin deficiencies, Lenhard said. And gastric banding has low effectiveness and a risk of the band slipping down the stomach.\n\nGetting longer term data is important, too. Three years is a good follow-up time for this type of study, and it has many more participants than similar studies.\n\n\"However, three years is not a long time overall in the life of a child,\" Raghuveer says. \"I'd be curious what happens to these kids at 10 years, 15 years later.\"\n\nMichalsky says the study is ongoing, and they expect to continuing gathering information for years to come.\n\nIdeally, public health efforts should aim for better obesity prevention, including parent education and interventions when children are toddlers and preschoolers, according to Raghuveer. \"A generational divide\" has left fewer families knowing how to fix meals, she says, and more families need to learn to cook and avoid packaged foods and microwave dinners.\n\n\"The big question is, how do we prevent obese kids from getting to this point where they would need an invasive surgical procedure?\" Raghuveer says. \"The bigger message should be that we should get to a point in society where we are not managing obesity, but we are preventing obesity.\"\n\nTara Haelle is the co-author of The Informed Parent: A Science-Based Resource for Your Child's First Four Years.

But serious side effects were more common among the briakinumab users.\n\n\"Very high levels of response\" were observed and maintained throughout the study period, said lead researcher Dr. Kristian Reich, a professor of dermatology at the University of Gottingen and a managing partner at Dermatologikum Hamburg, both in Germany.\n\nResults of the study are published in the Oct. 27 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. The study was funded by the drug's manufacturer, Abbott Laboratories.\n\nPsoriasis affects about 5 million Americans, according to the U.S. National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS). The disease causes patches of thick, red, inflamed skin that have silvery scales. Psoriasis can affect any part of the body, including the skin, nails, genitals and inside the mouth, according to NIAMS.\n\nThe current study included 317 people with moderate to severe psoriasis. The study volunteers had had psoriasis for at least six months, and the condition affected at least 10 percent of their bodies.\n\nNearly half of the study participants were randomly selected to receive injections of briakinumab at a dose of 200 milligrams (mg) for the first and fourth week of the study, and 100 mg at week eight and every four weeks thereafter. The study lasted one year. The remaining volunteers were given between 5 mg and 25 mg of oral methotrexate weekly.\n\nAfter six months, nearly 82 percent of those in the briakinumab group had at least a 75 percent improvement in the psoriasis area-and-severity index (PASI), a commonly used measurement to assess the severity of psoriasis. Slightly less than 40 percent of those on methotrexate had a 75 percent improvement in their PASI score, according to the study.\n\nAfter a year, about 66 percent of those taking briakinumab had a 75 percent improvement in their PASI score compared to almost 24 percent for those on methotrexate, according to the study.\n\nBriakinumab works by dampening the immune system response that causes psoriasis, said Bruce Bebo, director of research and medical programs for the National Psoriasis Foundation, based in Portland, Ore.\n\nMore serious infections were seen in people taking briakinumab (2.6 percent) vs. those taking methotrexate (1.8 percent). There were also two cases of cancer in people taking briakinumab and none in the methotrexate group. However, the researchers said these differences weren't statistically significant.\n\n\"Cancer risk is extremely hard to define, and this study was not powered to detect any difference in the risk of developing a malignancy,\" said Bebo.\n\nHe said that in an earlier trial of briakinumab, some unexplained major adverse cardiac events occurred. At the time, Abbott withdrew its application for approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration pending further research. In the current study, no serious cardiovascular events were reported.\n\nOf the increased infections and cancers, Reich said, \"Although these differences were not statistically significant, they lead to questions regarding a favorable risk-benefit profile of the drug.\"\n\nResearch on briakinumab is continuing.

Even with this trio of medicines, Mr. Brown\u2019s LDL cholesterol level hovered around 200.\n\nThe two PCSK9 inhibitors approved by the FDA last year were developed as a result of research done by UT Southwestern geneticists Dr. Helen Hobbs and Dr. Jonathan Cohen. Using data from the Dallas Heart Study, a population-based study that gathered extensive medical data on 6,000 Dallas residents, the two researchers showed that certain mutations to the gene that codes for the protein PCSK9 lead to low levels of cholesterol in the blood.\n\nFurther,Dr. Hobbs and Dr. Cohen found a woman who had inherited not one, but two of these mutations in the PCSK9 gene \u2013 one mutation from each parent. This woman had stunningly low levels of LDL cholesterol. While anything below 100 is considered good, her LDL cholesterol level was just 14. Crucially, this woman was in good health, suggesting that therapies aimed at blocking PCSK9 would not only be effective, but also safe.\n\nTheir research led to the development by drug companies of evolocumab and alirocumab, the two approved PCSK9 inhibitors, which are delivered by monthly or semimonthly injections.\n\nDr. Hobbs, Director of the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development, holds the Eugene McDermott Distinguished Chair for the Study of Human Growth and Development, the Philip O\u2019Bryan Montgomery, Jr., M.D. Distinguished Chair in Developmental Biology, and the 1995 Dallas Heart Ball Chair in Cardiology Research.

Now, new research reported in the journal Pediatrics finds, the combination of camphor, menthol and eucalyptus oils actually does ease cold symptoms and help children suffering from upper-respiratory infections sleep.\n\nIn the study, funded by an unrestricted research grant from Procter & Gamble, makers of Vicks, researchers took 138 children between the ages of 2 and 11, with symptoms like cough, congestion, runny nose and restless sleep that lasted seven days or more. Only children with moderate cough and severe stuffy nose were eligible, and those were divided into three groups.\n\nSome were treated with Vicks, some with a placebo consisting of petroleum jelly and others got no treatment at all. Parents were surveyed the day before treatment about the severity of their child's symptoms. That night, 30 minutes before bedtime, Vicks or petroleum jelly was rubbed onto the child's chest and neck. The next day parents were questioned about their child's symptoms overnight.\n\nChildren in all three groups got better, but those treated with the VapoRub saw the greatest improvement, and parents in this group also had improved sleep, the study found.\n\n\"The American Academy of Pediatrics says the currently available oral cough and cold medications are not effective for children and have the potential for side effects, \" said Dr. Ian Paul, principal investigator and associate professor of pediatrics and public health sciences, Penn State College of Medicine. \"This was based in part on some of the studies that we have conducted at Penn State.

Four years after the procedure, patients over 65 who had coronary artery bypass surgeries (called CABG or \"cabbages\") were almost 20 percent less likely to die.\n\nPut another way, 21 percent of stented patients had died after four years compared with 16 percent of surgery patients.\n\nIs that a big difference? Well, the study's lead author tells Shots that it might be enough to \"tip the balance a little bit, but not overwhelmingly so.\"\n\nThe National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, which funded the study with new \"stimulus\" money from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, is more bullish on the implications.\n\n\"We would hope a study as powerful as this one will inform decision-makers to rethink the direction they're going in,\" the NHLBI's Dr. Michael Lauer told Shots.

The study also appears online in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nIt draws on data from more than 86,000 patients across the nation who underwent CABG operations and nearly 104,000 patients who had coronary stenting.

[Brown University] -- To the tantalizing delight of chocolate lovers everywhere, a number of recent studies employing various methods have suggested that compounds in cocoa called flavanols could benefit cardiovascular health. Now a systematic review and meta-analysis of 19 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of cocoa consumption reveals some further pieces of supporting evidence.\n\nThe meta-analysis in the Journal of Nutrition, an assessment of the combined evidence from all 19 RCTs, focused on whether consumption of flavanol-rich cocoa products was associated with improvements in specific circulating biomarkers of cardiometabolic health as compared to consuming placebos with negligible cocoa flavanol content. In all, 1,139 volunteers were involved in these trials.\n\n\"Our meta-analysis of RCTs characterizes how cocoa flavanols affect cardiometabolic biomarkers, providing guidance in designing large, definitive prevention trials against diabetes and cardiovascular disease in future work,\" said corresponding author Dr. Simin Liu, professor and director of the Center for Global Cardiometabolic Health at Brown University who worked with epidemiology graduate student and lead author Xiaochen Lin. \"We found that cocoa flavanol intake may reduce dyslipidemia (elevated triglycerides), insulin resistance and systemic inflammation, which are all major subclinical risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases.\"\n\nLiu noted some limitations in the trials. All studies were small and of short duration, not all of the biomarkers tracked in these studies changed for the better, and none of the studies were designed to test directly whether cocoa flavanol consumption leads to reduced cases of heart attacks or type 2 diabetes.\n\nBut taking into account some of these heterogeneities across studies, the team's meta-analysis summarizing data from 19 trials found potential beneficial effects of flavanol-rich cocoa on cardiometabolic health. There were small-to-modest but statistically significant improvements among those who ate flavanol-rich cocoa product vs. those who did not.\n\nThe greatest effects were seen among trial volunteers who ate between 200 and 600 milligrams of flavanols a day (based on their cocoa consumption). They saw significant declines in blood glucose and insulin, as well as another indicator of insulin resistance called HOMA-IR. They also saw an increase in HDL, or \"good,\" cholesterol. Those consuming higher doses saw some of the insulin resistance benefits and a drop in triglycerides, but not a significant increase in HDL. Those with lower doses of flavanols only saw a significant HDL benefit.\n\nIn general, Lin said, where there were benefits they were evident for both women and men and didn't depend on what physical form the flavanol-rich cocoa product was consumed in --dark chocolate vs. a beverage, for example.\n\n\"The treatment groups of the trials included in our meta-analysis are primarily dark chocolate -- a few were using cocoa powder-based beverages,\" Lin said. \"Therefore, the findings from the current study apparently shouldn't be generalized to different sorts of chocolate candies or white chocolates, of which the content of sugar/food additives could be substantially higher than that of the dark chocolate.\"\n\nThe authors therefore concluded, \"Our study highlights the urgent need for large, long-term RCTs that improve our understanding of how the short-term benefits of cocoa flavanol intake on cardiometabolic biomarkers may be translated into clinical outcomes.\"\n\nIn addition to Lin and Liu, the study's other authors are Isabel Zhang, Alina Li from Brown University, JoAnn Manson, Howard Sesso and Lu Wang from Brigham and Women's Hospital.\n\nThe authors acknowledge funding from the National Institutes of Health including the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, the American Heart Association, and Pfizer.

One group of 105 patients was offered a three-month regimen of self-care advice on diet, exercise and psychological support.\n\nThe second group, of 85, was offered the same advice in the same time frame along with 10 half-hour weekly sessions of \"traditional\" acupuncture.\n\nAll of the participants kept hot flash diaries. At the end of the three-month period (and for up to six months thereafter) daily hot flash experiences were assessed for changing severity and frequency.\n\nThe result: by the end of the treatment period, those in the acupuncture group were found to have hot flash scores that were 50 percent lower than those in the non-acupuncture group. The finding continued to hold up for a half-year after the acupuncture sessions ended.\n\nThose in the acupuncture group also seemed to have a generally higher overall quality of life in terms of both physical and mental health, with no serious side effects, the study authors said.\n\nSo why does acupuncture seem to work?\n\nRazzini cited several reasons, including acupuncture's ability to prompt blood vessel dilation in the patient's nervous system, while stimulating the release of endorphins -- a neurotransmitter that interacts with brain cells involved in the regulation of pain and emotion. It also triggers the release of the stress hormone norepinephrine, as well as the mood regulator serotonin.\n\nRazzini didn't know how much American patients might have to pay for such treatment, but added, \"Compared to other effective treatments such as antidepressants, (acupuncture) should be less expensive, and, for sure, more safe and feasible.\"\n\nDr. Courtney Vito, a breast oncologic surgeon at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., was pleased that a serious issue in breast cancer treatment is getting a closer look.\n\n\"Anyone who treats breast cancer struggles with this problem in their practice, because the hot flashes that some women experience with anti-hormonal treatment can be profound,\" she said.\n\n\"Almost all women experience them. For some it's a moderate situation, but for others it's a really significant problem. Some women -- I would say probably about 15 percent -- have such severe hot flashes that they even refuse to take medications that can cut their risk for cancer or cancer recurrence by 50 percent, simply because they can't handle the hot flashes,\" Vito explained.\n\n\"And I've actually had patients who have had acupuncture with good success, so I'm not surprised by the finding,\" she added. \"But it is heartening that we now have scientific proof that this can work.

Losing weight is one of the best ways to find relief without having to rely on medication.\n\nQuitting smoking, limiting alcohol and avoiding carbonated drinks are also important protective measures. Smoking and alcohol can loosen tension of the upper esophageal sphincter and cause symptoms of reflux like hoarseness, postnasal drip and shortness of breath by irritating the mouth, larynx and trachea, Dr. Aviv reports.\n\nEating big meals, lying down before a meal is digested, and exercising too soon after eating can also trigger symptoms. Reflux sufferers are often advised to eat five or six small meals a day rather than one or two big ones, and to avoid eating within three hours of bedtime. For further protection, the head of the bed can be raised by six inches or more.\n\nBut while certain common foods \u2014 like raw onions, garlic, citrus juices, coffee and chocolate \u2014 are likely to cause reflux in most people with the condition, Dr. Aviv and other experts emphasize that everyone is different, and trial and error is the most effective way to determine an individual\u2019s trigger foods and drinks.

Accordingly, the 28-day \u201chealing\u201d diet he suggests consists almost entirely of natural, unprocessed foods, especially lean protein foods like light-meat poultry, fish, egg whites and low-fat dairy, beans (combined with whole grains), and nonacidic vegetables and fruits.\n\nHigh-fiber foods are very helpful, \u201csecond only to eliminating acidic foods,\u201d Dr. Aviv said. Fiber enhances digestion, reducing pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter, and can aid in weight loss and maintenance, among other benefits like reducing inflammation. Try to eat a pound of vegetables each day, half of which are cooked and the other half eaten raw, as well as half a pound of raw fruit. Good sources include broccoli, carrots, beets, green leafy vegetables, apples, berries, bananas, avocados and pears.

Ketamine infusion therapy, the controversial treatment for depression, has been resisted by many physicians due to concerns about short-lived benefits, risks of addiction, and the lack of large scale studies. In contrast, this retrospective study of over three years of clinical experience, shows lasting benefits for many patients, with no apparent risk of addiction. Through a handful of ketamine infusions directed by Theodore Henderson, MD, PhD, refractory depression symptoms can be relieved significantly and persistently. Evidence points to the regeneration of brain cells as a critical mechanism for the relief of depression, as published in peer-reviewed journal Neural Regeneration Research, February 2016 issue.\n\nThe study, \"Practical application of the neuroregenerative properties of ketamine: real world treatment experience,\" addresses key points in the controversy surrounding the use of intravenous ketamine for the treatment of depression. Its findings stand in direct contrast to warnings from the American Psychiatric Association (APA).\n\nWhile controversial in academic settings, Dr. Henderson said his direct experience supports a different strategy for multiple-infusion treatment regimens and his clinical experience shows ketamine can invoke long-lasting effects often with less than six infusions.\n\n\"The wealth of clinical experience from treating hundreds of patients with ketamine has supplanted the preliminary data that emerged from the initial open-label and small double-blinded studies,\" said Dr. Henderson, who is a board certified psychiatrist, specializing in diagnosing and treating complex conditions, based in Denver, Colorado. He is also the co-founder of Neuro-Luminance Ketamine Infusion Centers.\n\nPatients in the study completed the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-SR), among other scales, and 80% showed persistent positive response to the ketamine infusions treatments.\n\nKetamine is a dissociative anesthetic in use since 1970's. Intravenous administration over a prolonged period of time is key to its persistent antidepressant benefit.\n\nDepression is associated with neuron loss, reduced synapse numbers, and dearborization of dendrites. Ketamine appears to potently induce mechanisms which reverse these neuro-degenerative processes. Citing over 60 published scientific research studies, the new research article also reviews the molecular mechanisms by which ketamine invokes a robust activation of the brain's own repair mechanisms. Another conclusion Dr. Henderson highlights is ketamine infusions can relieve refractory depression symptoms persistently, perhaps for years.\n\n\"Activation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) appears to have an important role in the antidepressant effects of ketamine. BDNF induces synaptogenesis, dendritic arborization, improved neuronal health, and neurogenesis. These processes likely underlie the persistent benefits of ketamine.\"\n\nDr. Henderson's findings challenge the oft-held beliefs that ketamine must be given frequently to have any benefit and that ketamine has no long-lasting benefit.\n\nDr. Henderson stated, \"Misconceptions about ketamine abound among psychiatrists, particularly related to possible chemical dependence problems. However, the neurobiological basis of its benefit for depression has nothing to do with causing addictive risk. Our patients get better after a few infusions and from there treatments can be discontinued.\" The study also challenges concerns about neurotoxicity and a recent hypothesis that patients must experience hallucinations during ketamine infusion in order to have an anti-depressant benefit.\n\nPlease visit Neuro-Luminance or call (855) 978-0808 for more information.", "question": "Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Other than to note that the author of the study is co-founder of an unspecified number of ketamine infusion centers, the news release does not address where to access the treatment.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "WEDNESDAY, June 1, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- If you find yourself hospitalized, you've got a one in five chance of needing a urinary catheter -- raising your risk for a urinary tract infection.\n\nNow, researchers report that a new program shows it might be possible to reduce both catheter use and its associated infections.\n\n\"Catheter-associated urinary tract infections are common and costly patient safety problems,\" said lead researcher Dr. Sanjay Saint.

It is also the first clinical trial investigating the efficacy, tolerability and safety of intranasal-administered oxytocin in young children with autism.\n\nAutism is a group of complex brain developmental disorders characterized by impairments in social interaction, communication, and stereotypical and repetitive behaviours. The diagnosed incidence is estimated to be one in 68 children and effective interventions remain limited.\n\nBehavioural therapies can improve social, emotional and behavioural impairments but these are typically time consuming (40 hours per week), remain costly and show mixed outcomes.

This amount of zinc is equivalent to what biofortified crops like zinc rice and zinc wheat can add to the diet of vulnerable, nutrient deficient populations.\n\nThe study, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, was led by CHORI Senior Scientist Janet King, PhD. King and her team are the first to show that a modest increase in dietary zinc reduces oxidative stress and damage to DNA.\n\n\"We were pleasantly surprised to see that just a small increase in dietary zinc can have such a significant impact on how metabolism is carried out throughout the body,\" says King. \"These results present a new strategy for measuring the impact of zinc on health and reinforce the evidence that food-based interventions can improve micronutrient deficiencies worldwide.\"\n\nZinc is ubiquitous in our body and facilitates many functions that are essential for preserving life. It plays a vital role in maintaining optimal childhood growth, and in ensuring a healthy immune system. Zinc also helps limit inflammation and oxidative stress in our body, which are associated with the onset of chronic cardiovascular diseases and cancers.\n\nAround much of the world, many households eat polished white rice or highly refined wheat or maize flours, which provide energy but do not provide enough essential micronutrients such as zinc. Zinc is an essential part of nearly 3,000 different proteins, and it impacts how these proteins regulate every cell in our body. In the absence of sufficient zinc, our ability to repair everyday wear and tear on our DNA is compromised.\n\nIn the randomized, controlled, six-week study the scientists measured the impact of zinc on human metabolism by counting DNA strand breaks. They used the parameter of DNA damage to examine the influence of a moderate amount of zinc on healthy living. This was a novel approach, different from the commonly used method of looking at zinc in the blood or using stunting and morbidity for assessing zinc status.\n\nAccording to King, these results are relevant to the planning and evaluation of food-based solutions for mitigating the impact of hidden hunger and malnutrition.

But they also recommend that patients seek the best colonoscopists by, for example, asking pointed questions about how many polyps they find and remove. They also say patients should be scrupulous in the unpleasant bowel cleansing that precedes the test, and promptly report symptoms like bleeding even if they occur soon after a colonoscopy.\n\nThe American Cancer Society says that even if the test is less effective than many had believed, it has no plans to change its recommended intervals between screenings \u2014 the test still prevents most cancers, but the expense and risk of the test argue against doing it more often.\n\nThe cancer society and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also are focusing on developing measurements of quality so that doctors who do colonoscopies can assess themselves and improve.\n\nBut gastroenterologists say that, if nothing else, the study points up the paucity of evidence for the common suggestion that anyone who had a clean bill of health from a colonoscopy is almost totally protected for at least a decade.\n\n\u201cWe have to not overpromise,\u201d said Dr. Ransohoff, who wrote an editorial accompanying the colonoscopy paper. \u201cWe need to look at the evidence, and we shouldn\u2019t go beyond it.\u201d\n\nThe new study matched each of 10,292 people who died of colon cancer to five people who lived in the same area and were of the same age, sex and socioeconomic status. The researchers asked how many patients and control subjects had had colonoscopies and whether the doctors had removed polyps. Then the researchers compared the groups and asked how much the colon cancer death rate had declined in people who had had the screening test.\n\nThe results were \u201ca shock,\u201d said Dr. Nancy N. Baxter, the lead author of the paper and a colorectal surgeon at the University of Toronto. When she saw them, she said, \u201cI asked my analyst to rerun the data.\u201d\n\nNow, researchers say, the challenge is to find out why the test missed so many cancers, in particular, those on the right side of the colon, and whether the problem can be fixed.\n\nAbout 148,000 people will learn they have colon cancer this year, the American Cancer Society reports, and nearly 50,000 will die of it.\n\nIt might be that Canadian doctors were not sufficiently skilled. About a third of the colonoscopies were done by general internists and family practitioners who might not have had the experience to do the test well.\n\nBut, said Dr. Douglas K. Rex, director of endoscopy and professor of medicine at Indiana University, that cannot be the entire explanation because at least one study, as yet unpublished, involving California Medi-Cal patients also found the test missed many cancers on the right side of the colon.\n\nThat leaves several other possibilities.\n\nPerhaps patients did not sufficiently cleanse their bowels of fecal material, a particular problem for the right side of the colon.\n\n\u201cAfter the prep has been completed, mucus and intestinal secretions start rolling out of the small intestine and colon,\u201d Dr. Rex explained. The secretions, he added, pour from the base of the appendix into the right side of the colon and are \u201cvery sticky\u201d and can obscure polyps.\n\nOne solution, supported by six studies, is to be sure there is just a short time between when patients finish taking the strong laxative that cleanses their bowel and the colonoscopy, Dr. Rex said. That usually means taking half of the laxative the night before the screening test and the rest in the morning, something that often is not done, he added, but that he and others recommend.\n\nCancer may also be different in the right colon, researchers said.\n\nFlat and indented polyps tend to cluster in the right colon. And so do another kind, serrated lesions, which, some studies indicate, might turn into cancer much more quickly than typical polyps.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that we will never get as good a result\u201d in the right colon, said Robert Smith, director of screening for the American Cancer Society.\n\nStill, he said, that does not mean that patients should have more frequent colonoscopies. The tests are \u201chugely expensive,\u201d he said, and insurers may not pay for more frequent colonoscopies. The test also carries a small risk of perforating the bowel. Even if colonoscopies miss some cancers, colon cancer remains a rare disease and, after a colonoscopy, \u201cthe likelihood that you have cancer is very, very low,\u201d Dr. Smith said.\n\nDr. Harold C. Sox, editor of the Annals of Internal Medicine, is choosing another option. He is having a stool test, the fecal occult blood test, between colonoscopies. It looks for blood in the stool, which can arise from colon cancer.\n\nDr. Smith does not advocate that strategy, saying that the stool test can have false positives from things like red meat or broccoli that have nothing to do with colon cancer. He worries that frequent stool tests will lead to frequent false alarms and frequent colonoscopies without making much of a dent in the colon cancer death rate.\n\nCT colonoscopies, so-called virtual colonoscopies, are not a solution, some screening experts said.\n\n\u201cThe issues are prep quality, flat lesions, serrated lesions and people not being careful enough in the inspection process,\u201d Dr. Rex said. There is no evidence, he added, that a virtual colonoscopy will help with the inspection process. And, he said, \u201cit almost certainly is not as effective a technology as colonoscopy for flat and serrated lesions.\u201d\n\nInstead, patients should be compulsive about their bowel prep and be sure the test is done by one of the best colonoscopists in their area, gastroenterologists said. Doctors should find polyps in at least 25 percent of men and 15 percent of women. They should take at least eight minutes to withdraw an endoscope from the colon. And they should do a high volume of screening. Dr. Smith said a high volume was at least three or four colonoscopies a day.\n\nAfter the test, patients can ask whether the doctor got to the right side of the colon and how that was documented.\n\nColon cancer experts said people should realize that even if colonoscopies prevent just 60 percent of colon cancer deaths, that still is a lot. Mammograms, for example, prevent 25 percent of breast cancer deaths, and the PSA test for men has not been shown to prevent prostate cancer deaths.\n\n\u201cIf I was to provide one main message, it would be that colonoscopies are the way that colon cancer mortality gets reduced,\u201d Dr. Ransohoff said. \u201cColonoscopy is a good test, but it isn\u2019t completely effective.

We ought to be happy with that.\u201d", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Clearly colonoscopy is available.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "But in many cases it is just not known whether what is seen on a scan is the cause of the pain. The problem is that all too often, no one knows what is normal.\n\n\u201cA patient comes in because he\u2019s in pain,\u201d said Dr. Nelda Wray, a senior research scientist at the Methodist Institute for Technology in Houston. \u201cWe see something in a scan, and we assume causation. But we have no idea of the prevalence of the abnormality in routine populations.\u201d\n\nNow, as more and more people have scans for everything from headaches to foot aches, more are left in a medical lurch, or with unnecessary or sometimes even harmful treatments, including surgery.\n\n\u201cEvery time we get a new technology that provides insights into structures we didn\u2019t encounter before, we end up saying, \u2018Oh, my God, look at all those abnormalities.\u2019 They might be dangerous,\u201d said Dr. David Felson, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Boston University Medical School. \u201cSome are, some aren\u2019t, but it ends up leading to a lot of care that\u2019s unnecessary.\u201d\n\nThat was what almost happened with Mrs. Weinstein, an active, athletic 64-year-old who lives in New London, N.H. And it was her great fortune to finally visit a surgeon who told her so. He told her bluntly that her pain was caused by arthritis, not the torn cartilage.\n\nNo one had told her that before, Mrs. Weinstein said, and looking back on her quest to get a scan and get the cartilage fixed, she shook her head in dismay. There\u2019s no surgical procedure short of a knee replacement that will help, and she\u2019s not ready for a knee replacement.\n\n\u201cI feel that I have come full circle,\u201d she said. \u201cI will cope on my own with this knee.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Mrs. Weinstein was also lucky because her problem was with her knee. It\u2019s one of only two body parts \u2014 the other is the back \u2014 where there are good data on abnormalities that turn up in people who feel just fine, indicating that the abnormalities may not be so abnormal after all.\n\nBut even the data on knees comes from just one study, and researchers say the problem is far from fixed. It is difficult to conduct scans on people who feel fine \u2014 most do not want to spend time in an M.R.I. machine, and CT scans require that people be exposed to radiation. But that leaves patients and doctors in an untenable situation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a concern, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Jarvik, a professor of radiology and neurosurgery at the University of Washington. \u201cWe are trying to fix things that shouldn\u2019t be fixed.\u201d\n\nAs a rheumatologist, Dr. Felson saw patient after patient with knee pain, many of whom had already had scans. And he was becoming concerned about their findings.\n\nOften, a scan would show that a person with arthritis had a torn meniscus, cartilage that stabilizes the knee. And often the result was surgery \u2014 orthopedic surgeons do more meniscus surgery than any other operation. But, Dr. Felson wondered, was the torn cartilage an injury causing pain or was the arthritis causing pain and the tear a consequence of arthritis?\n\nThat led Dr. Felson and his colleagues to do the first and so far the only large study of knees, asking what is normal. It involved M.R.I. scans on 991 people ages 50 to 90. Some had knee pain, others did not.\n\nOn Sept. 11, Dr. Felson and his colleagues published their results in The New England Journal of Medicine: meniscal tears were just as common in people with knee arthritis who did not complain of pain as they were in people with knee arthritis who did have pain. They tended to occur along with arthritis and were a part of the disease process itself. And so repairing the tears would not eliminate the pain.\n\n\u201cThe rule is, as you get older, you will get a meniscal tear,\u201d Dr. Felson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a function of aging and disease. If you are a 60-year-old guy, the chance that you have a meniscal tear is 40 percent.\u201d\n\nIt is a result that paralleled what spine researchers found over the past decade in what is perhaps the best evidence on what shows up on scans of healthy people. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to look at a spine, you need to know what that spine might look like in a normal patient,\u201d said Dr. Michael Modic, chairman of the Neurological Institute at the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nAfter Dr. Modic and others scanned hundreds of asymptomatic people, they learned abnormalities were common.\n\n\u201cSomewhere between 20 and 25 percent of people who climb into a scanner will have a herniated disk,\u201d Dr. Modic said. As many as 60 percent of healthy adults with no back pain, he said, have degenerative changes in their spines.\n\nThose findings made Dr. Modic ask: Why do a scan in the first place? There are some who may benefit from surgery, but does it make sense to routinely do scans for nearly everyone with back pain? After all, one-third of herniated disks disappear on their own in six weeks, and two-thirds in six months.\n\nAnd surgeons use symptoms and a physical examination to identify patients who would be helped by operations. What extra medical help does a scan provide? So Dr. Modic did another study, this time with 250 patients. All had M.R.I. scans when they first arrived complaining of back pain or shooting pains down their leg, which can be caused by a herniated disc pressing on a nerve in the spine. And all had scans again six weeks later. Sixty percent had herniated disks, the scans showed.\n\nDr. Modic gave the results to only half of the patients and their doctors \u2014 the others had no idea what the M.R.I.\u2019s revealed. Dr. Modic knew, though.\n\nIn 13 percent of the patients, the second scan showed that the herniated disk had become bigger or a new herniated disk had appeared. In 15 percent, the herniated disk had disappeared. But there was no relationship between the scan findings at six weeks and patients\u2019 symptoms. Some continued to complain of pain even though their herniated disk had disappeared; others said they felt better even though their herniation had grown bigger.\n\nThe question, though, was whether it helped the patients and their doctors to know what the M.R.I.\u2019s had found. And the answer, Dr. Modic reported, is that it did not. The patients who knew recovered no faster than those who did not know. However, Dr. Modic said, there was one effect of being told \u2014 patients felt worse about themselves when they knew they had a bulging disk.\n\n\u201cIf I tell you that you have a degenerated disk, basically I\u2019m telling you you\u2019re ugly,\u201d Dr. Modic said.\n\nScans, he said, are presurgical tools, not screening tools. A scan can help a surgeon before he or she operates, but it does not help with a diagnosis.\n\n\u201cIf a patient has back or leg pain, they should be treated conservatively for at least eight weeks,\u201d Dr. Modic said, meaning that they take pain relievers and go about their normal lives. \u201cThen you should do imaging only if you are going to do surgery.\u201d\n\nThat message can be a hard sell, he acknowledged. \u201cA lot of people are driven by wanting to have imaging,\u201d Dr. Modic said. \u201cThey are miserable as hell, they can\u2019t work, they can\u2019t sit. We look at you and say, \u2018We think you have a herniated disk. We say the natural history is that you will get better. You should go through six to eight weeks of conservative management.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAt the Partners Healthcare System in Boston, spine experts have the same struggle to convince patients that an M.R.I. scan is not necessarily desirable, said Dr. Scott Gazelle, director of radiology there.\n\n\u201cThe consensus is that you are a surgical candidate or not based on your history and physical findings, not on imaging findings,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Gazelle had a chance last year to test his own convictions. He had the classic symptoms of a herniated disk \u2014 shooting pains down his left leg, a numb foot and difficulty walking.\n\nDr. Gazelle went to see his primary-care doctor but, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t get an M.R.I.\u201d That decision, he added, \u201cwas the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nAbout three months later, he had recovered on his own.\n\nIn 1998, two medical scientists, writing in The Lancet, proposed what sounded like a radical idea. Instead of simply providing patients and their doctors with the results of an X-ray or an M.R.I. scan, he said, radiologists should put the findings in context. For example, they wrote, if a scan showed advanced disk deterioration, the report should say, \u201cRoughly 40 percent of patients with this finding do not have back pain so the finding may be unrelated.\u201d\n\nIt is an idea that only would work for back pain, because that is the one area where radiologists have enough data. But it made eminent sense to Dr. Jarvik. \u201cIt gives referring physicians some sort of context,\u201d he said.\n\nSo, a few years ago, with some trepidation, his radiology group starting including epidemiological data in their reports. \u201cWe thought, \u2018What\u2019s going to be the reaction among referring physicians?\u2019 \u201d Dr. Jarvik said.

She skis, she does aerobics, she was nowhere near ready for something so drastic.\n\nThen the surgeon told her that there was no point in repairing her meniscus because that was not her problem.

Its cause is still unknown, but over the years, researchers have identified various brain, immune system and energy metabolism irregularities involved. Some patients describe the syndrome as feeling like an \"unrelenting, unremitting flu.\"\n\nDoctors say some treatments can help. Arthur Barsky, a psychiatrist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and a professor at Harvard Medical School, says patients need to change how they experience symptoms \u2014 typically pain, insomnia and anxiety. When patients adopt a more positive attitude, Barsky points out, it often translates into greater confidence and more energy.\n\nA study published this year in the Lancet found that a form of talk therapy, as well as exercise, offered relief for some patients. Researchers from the United Kingdom looked at cognitive behavior therapy, or CBT.\n\nIn the study, over 600 patients with chronic fatigue syndrome were assigned to different treatments. All of them received medical care for symptoms like pain, insomnia or anxiety.\n\nOne group got counseled about how to pace activities. Another took part in an exercise program. And a third received the cognitive behavioral talk therapy. The therapy and the exercise group improved the most, reporting less fatigue, insomnia and anxiety.\n\nBarsky says his patients do best when cognitive behavior therapy is also combined with gradually increased exercise. \"People need to begin to push themselves in the face of their fatigue, because if you don't, you become deconditioned and you get caught in a cycle which ... makes fatigue worse,\" says Barsky.\n\nBut he cautions against overdoing it. People should start with mild, gentle exercise like clearing the table, doing the dishes, or taking the dog for a short walk. Then, slowly build up to longer and more frequent walks, he says.\n\nLucinda Bateman is a doctor at the Fatigue Consultation Clinic in Salt Lake City who specializes in chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\nShe's skeptical about the Lancet study, pointing out that patients improved only moderately, and not much more than those who were counseled about pacing themselves. Bateman suggests her patients pace themselves, and try to do only as many activities as they can manage.\n\nShe says some patients get caught in a \"push and crash\" cycle. When symptoms abate and they feel better, they may go all out, exercising, doing errands and socializing. But soon that level of activity often comes to a crashing end and patients can relapse dramatically, even becoming bedridden for several days or longer.\n\nBateman takes also issue with CBT's implication that chronic fatigue syndrome is psychosomatic.

Along with obesity, high levels of blood fats can lead to heart disease and other health problems, including diabetes.\n\nThe U.S. government currently recommends screening for high cholesterol in children with a family history of heart disease or high cholesterol (with at least one parent or grandparent who has suffered a premature heart event such as heart attack or stroke, or at least one parent with total cholesterol levels above 240 mg/dL). The guidelines also recommend that youngsters whose parents are not aware of their family history of heart disease be screened.\n\nIn the new study, led by Dr. William Neal of West Virginia University, scientists observed a group of more than 20,000 fifth-graders in West Virginia and found that 71% were eligible for cholesterol screening based on national criteria. Experts believe using family history is a good way to identify children who may be at greatest risk of high cholesterol \u0097 and therefore of future heart disease. Based on the results of the screen, doctors may then advise families to change their children's diet or exercise routines or prescribe medication to lower their cholesterol.\n\nBut because West Virginia has one of the nation's highest rates of death from heart disease, since 2000, the state has offered free, universal cholesterol screening to all fifth-graders enrolled in public schools. That allowed Neal and his team to determine how many children who actually had high cholesterol would have been missed if they had been screened based on federal guidelines.\n\nAmong the 5,798 children who would not have been screened, nearly 10% had elevated LDL cholesterol levels (above 130 mg/dL), according to the study, published in the August issue of Pediatrics. And 1.7% had levels high enough (above 160 mg/dL) to warrant cholesterol-lowering medications. Indeed, of all the children in the study whose LDL levels were above 160, one-third were in the group who would not have been screened.\n\nThe current guidelines were put in place in the 1990s, and at the time, experts predicted that high cholesterol would be missed in as many as 25% of children, says Neal. But doctors assumed that in most cases, these children would have only slightly elevated cholesterol levels that would eventually be detected when they became adults and would be lowered with diet and exercise.\n\nNeal's data show that may not be the case. Further, Neal says, the findings apply not only to heart-disease risk but also to the risk of diabetes, since high cholesterol at a young age is a strong predictor of prediabetes and diabetes. \"We worry about that because if these children don't change their ways, then they are going to have Type 2 diabetes,\" he says. \"It's something we would become more aware of if more children were screened.\"\n\nNot everyone agrees that universal screening is the answer. Rather than calling for all youngsters to have their cholesterol tested, which would entail considerable expense on the national level, Dr. Ralph Sacco, president of the American Heart Association (AHA), suggests looking more critically at current screening guidelines. \"Maybe the way we are doing family screening, with a very simplistic questionnaire about any parent having early heart disease or having high blood cholesterol, is not effective,\" he says. \"I think we need more effective screening tools. We need to assess these options before jumping to possible universal screening.\"\n\nSacco notes that both the AHA and the American Academy of Pediatrics now recommend cholesterol screening in children with risk factors for heart disease other than family history, such as obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes. \"The weight of the child, his waist circumference and whether he has siblings who are overweight would help to select a group that is at greater risk of having high cholesterol,\" he says. \"Now that we have this data, it does call into question these original guidelines from the government.\" The next update of the recommendations is expected in spring 2011.\n\nSee TIME's Pictures of the Week.\n\nSee the Cartoons of the Week.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "1clip_filelist.xml\" rel=\"File-List\"/>\n\n\n\nThe availability of cholesterol screening is not at issue.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "Newswise \u2014 SEATTLE (March 24, 2017) \u2013 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration yesterday granted accelerated approval to the checkpoint inhibitor Bavencio (avelumab) for the treatment of patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), including those who have not received prior chemotherapy. Avelumab is the first FDA-approved treatment for metastatic MCC and the first disease that the drug has ever been approved to treat.\n\nA rare and aggressive form of skin cancer, MCC, is 35 times less common than melanoma, but on average, it is about three times more likely to be deadly. Until now, there were no systemic therapies approved by the Food and Drug Administration for this cancer, and no approved therapies once the cancer had spread.\n\nTom Judd, who lives near Portland, Oregon, knows what it is like to be diagnosed with a deadly cancer for which there is no approved drug.

Then he enrolled in a clinical trial and received his first of many infusions of the new immunotherapy drug \u2013 avelumab. Within six weeks of that first infusion, more than one-third of the cancer throughout his body was gone, and today, more than 90 percent of his tumor mass has disappeared.\n\nBecause of the data from this clinical trial, avelumab (brand name Bavencio) has become the first systemic therapy approved by the FDA for MCC, and the first treatment of any kind approved for metastatic MCC.\n\nDr. Paul Nghiem, affiliate investigator of the Clinical Research Division at Fred Hutch, and the George F.

The drug also reduced the frequency of disease exacerbations that required treatment with antibiotics.\n\nThe caveat is that VX-770 is designed to counter one specific genetic mutation that accounts for about 4 percent of cases of cystic fibrosis. Vertex is working on another drug for the most common mutation, but that one is further behind in development.\n\nStill, the news is expected to be greeted favorably by doctors and patients and by Wall Street.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing clinical trials for 30 years in C.F. and these are amazing results,\u2019\u2019 Dr. Bonnie W. Ramsey, a lead investigator in the trial, said in an interview.\n\nDr. Ramsey, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington, was briefed on the results by Vertex.\n\nThe results were announced by a press release and have not been peer reviewed by experts.\n\nAbout 30,000 Americans and 70,000 people worldwide have cystic fibrosis, a disease caused by defects in a gene responsible for the transport of chloride ions across cell membranes. People with the disease tend to have very thick mucus in their lungs, which leads to infections and lung damage. Many do not live past age 40.\n\nTwo inhaled antibiotics and one drug that loosens mucus are approved to treat cystic fibrosis, but nothing that directly improves chloride ion transport.\n\n \n\n In the trial, those who received VX-770 gained 10.6 percentage points more on a lung function test after 24 weeks than those getting a placebo, a difference that statistically was highly significant. Patients continued to take either drug or placebo for another 24 weeks and the improvement was sustained. Lung function, the primary endpoint of the trial, was measured by how much a person could exhale in one second, a standard test.\n\nInvestors had been expecting around a 5 percentage point improvement. In a note to clients Tuesday evening, before the results were known, an analyst at ISI Group, Mark Schoenebaum, said that an improvement of 10 percent would be a \u201chome run\u2019\u2019 that could lead to $600 million in annual sales for the drug.\n\nDr. Ramsey, who has received research grants from Vertex, said that some patients could perceive a 10 percentage point change in lung function. She said other results of the trial were encouraging.\n\nThese included fewer exacerbations of the disease in those who got the drug, fewer self-reported respiratory symptoms, and a gain in weight, which is good for people with cystic fibrosis, who often have digestive problems. The saltiness of their sweat \u2014 a measure used to diagnose the disease \u2014 was markedly reduced, suggesting that the drug was having an effect on chloride ion transport.\n\nThe trial involved 161 people age 12 and older, all with at least one copy of the particular mutation, known as G551D. The main side effects, Vertex said, were headache, upper respiratory tract infections, nasal congestion, rash and dizziness.\n\nVertex said it hoped to apply in the second half of the year for approval of VX-770 in the United States and Europe. The company is awaiting results of a second trial of the drug, this one in younger children.\n\nVertex has not said how much it will charge for VX-770. But since there are only about 1,200 Americans who are candidates for the drug, the price is likely to be tens of thousands of dollars a year.\n\nVertex, based in Cambridge, Mass., was founded in 1989, coincidentally the same year the cystic fibrosis gene was discovered. It has not yet had a big commercial success and had a $2.5 billion net loss in the last five years.\n\nThe company is hoping that by late May it will win approval to sell a new type of drug for hepatitis C, which analysts expect will be a blockbuster.\n\nThe long time needed to develop a drug for cystic fibrosis is a lesson for those expecting a quick payout from the sequencing of the human genome, which was completed a decade ago. It is not enough to know the gene behind a disease. It can take years of research to determine how a mutation actually causes a disease and then to design a drug that corrects the problem.\n\nVertex received $75 million in financial support from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, one of the first nonprofit disease groups to give money to companies.\n\n\u201cThese results are highly encouraging,\u2019\u2019 Robert J.

It is less useful for some of the most common diseases, such as heart disease or diabetes, because they are influenced by vast numbers of genes-gone-wrong working together in complicated ways.\n\nOn Monday, researchers revealed a new way to measure millions of small genetic variations that add up to cause harm, letting them calculate someone's inherited risk for the most common form of heart disease and four other serious disorders. They estimated that up to 25 million Americans may have triple the average person's risk for coronary artery disease even if they haven't yet developed warning signs like high cholesterol.\n\n\"What I foresee is in five years, each person will know this risk number, this 'polygenic risk score,' similar to the way each person knows his or her cholesterol,\" said Dr. Sekar Kathiresan, who led the research team from the Broad Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.\n\nIf the approach pans out and doctors adopt it, a bad score wouldn't mean that you'd get a disease, just that your genetic makeup increases the chance \u2014 one more piece of information in deciding on care. For example, when the researchers tested the system using a DNA database from Britain, less than 1 percent of people with the lowest risk scores were diagnosed with coronary artery disease, compared with 11 percent of people with the highest risk score.\n\n\"There are things you can do to lower the risk,\" Kathiresan said \u2014 the usual advice about diet, exercise, cholesterol medication and not smoking helps.\n\nOn the flip side, a low-risk score \"doesn't give you a free pass,\" he added. An unhealthy lifestyle could overwhelm the protection of good genes.\n\nThe scoring system can also predict an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, breast cancer and an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation, the team reported in the journal Nature Genetics \u2014 noting that next steps include learning what might likewise lower those risks.\n\nIt doesn't require the most sophisticated type of genetic testing.

The drug, which consists of stem cells from donor bone marrow, gets injected into the vein. The cells then travel through the bloodstream and take up residence in the heart.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells have some natural homing capability, and injury serves as a homing beacon for them, Karp said.\n\nThe stem cells reduce the amount of scar tissue and increase the pumping strength of the heart in heart attack patients, Hare said. To a limited extent, they also grow new heart muscle.\n\nThe phase I results from 53 patients are not definitive proof that the treatment is effective, but do suggest so, Hare said. In accordance with clinical trial regulations set by the Food and Drug Administration, phase I is meant to show safety, while phase II and phase III trials are done on a larger group of subjects and evaluate how well the drug works.\n\nIn this trial, patients' doses ranged from 35 million cells to 350 million cells. There was no change or increase in side effects in treatments getting higher doses of cells, but it seemed that the treatment was more effective -- at least in terms of reducing electrical problems -- in the high dose group, he said.\n\nIn separate trials, researchers are looking at how the technique works in patients who have had heart attacks many month or years in the past, Hare said.\n\nThe study shows the results of a six-month follow-up with patients in 2007, and researchers are presently working with data from the two-year follow-up.\n\nMore broadly, besides bone marrow transplantations, there have not been any major successes in the stem cell field in terms of helping large numbers of patients, Karp said.\n\n\"Mesenchymal stem cells are poised to really be the next major success in cell therapy that could be used to treat tens of thousands of patients,\" he said.\n\nThere are several advantages to using mesenchymal stem cells for heart therapy. First, they are adult stem cells, so there are no ethical issues that surround research on embryonic stem cells. Secondly, at least from a safety perspective, mesenchymal stem cells do not require matching -- any donor can give cells to any other donor, and no immunosuppresant drugs are necessary, he said.\n\nStill, millions of cells are required in order for enough stem cells to reach the heart and have a therapeutic benefit, and it's costly to get the required numbers of cells for each patient, Karp said. An area of improvement would be making the stem cell treatment more efficient, he said.\n\n\"If we could increase the number of cells that could reach the heart, that would have significant advantages to this approach,\" Karp said.\n\nThis method of intravenous injection means that the procedure theoretically could be performed in a doctor's office or clinic, increasing the accesibility to patients, Karp said.\n\nA more invasive stem cell delivery technique has been showing positive results in other clinical trials, involving injecting patients' own stem cells directly into heart muscle.\n\nThe largest national stem cell study for heart disease, sponsored by Baxter Inc., uses this surgical method, and recently announced success in a 12-month phase II trial for patients with severe angina. Researchers found that participants had less pain and an improved ability to walk.\n\nBecause stem cells are delivered through a catheter in this method, there is a risk of perforation of about 1 percent, Dr. Douglas Losordo, cardiologist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, told CNN earlier this year. The drug, GCSF, which mobilizes stem cells, also carries a small risk of blood clotting.\n\nFor the Osiris trials, further research is ongoing determine whether patients would benefit more from more infusions of the stem cells, or if it's better for the stem cells to come from their own bodies instead of from a donor, Hare said.\n\nWhile there's less chance of a person's body rejecting his or her own stem cells than from a donor, there is a time delay, he said. Taking bone marrow and amplifying the stem cells in it could take up to five weeks, whereas donor cells could be made readily available, he said. On the other hand, it is unclear whether a donor could potentially transmit a disease to the recipient in the process.\n\nIf you are interested in enrolling in a clinical trial, you can find one at clinicaltrials.gov.

DeKosky, vice president and dean of the University of Virginia School of Medicine in Charlottesville.\n\n\"If you are older and thinking 'I'll try ginkgo to preserve brain health,' we have no evidence that it is useful,\" he said. \"I won't take it anymore.\"\n\nThe report, published in the Dec. 23-30 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, supports the findings of earlier, smaller studies.\n\nTo test ginkgo's effect on cognitive decline, DeKosky's group looked at results from the ginkgo Evaluation of Memory study, which included 3,069 community-dwelling adults 72 to 96 years of age. The participants, who were generally healthy when the study began, either took 120 milligrams of ginkgo or placebo twice a day and were routinely tested for cognitive abilities.\n\nOver more than six years of follow-up, the researchers found no evidence that ginkgo delayed or prevented normal declines in memory, language, attention, visuospatial abilities or executive functions, such as anticipating outcomes and adapting to changing situations and thinking abstractly.\n\nThese results remained the same regardless of sex, age, race or education, the researchers noted.\n\nHowever, ginkgo was safe and no serious side effects were noted, DeKosky added. \"The good news is it appeared that it was fairly safe; the bad news was it didn't seem to do anything at least as far as trying to slow down the cognitive changes of aging.\"\n\nEarlier results from the same study found that ginkgo did not prevent or slow the development of Alzheimer's or other dementias, DeKosky said.\n\nThe American Botanical council took issue with the findings, however.\n\n\"There are many significant limitations of this study,\" Mark Blumenthal, council founder and executive director said in a statement.\n\n\"First, the data being published this week are drawn from a previous clinical trial which was not designed to determine the decline in cognition. Second, about 40 percent of the subjects dropped out over the six-year duration of the trial; the statistics reported in the study include the dropouts for which no final data are available,\" Blumenthal said. \"Further, the subjects in the study were not monitored for certain cognitive parameters until several years after the trial began, creating difficulty in determining accurately whether they experienced a decline in cognition or not. Also, the age of the subjects is quite advanced, at an average of 79 years at the beginning of the trial. This age group is not typical of the age of both healthy people and those with mild cognitive impairment who use ginkgo for improving mental performance.\"\n\nAnother group, the Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN), which represents the dietary supplement industry, also had reservations about the study.\n\nIn a statement, Douglas MacKay, CRN's vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs, said that \"there is a large body of previously published evidence, as well as ongoing trials, which suggest that ginkgo biloba is effective for helping to improve cognitive impairment in older adults.\" He added that, \"as a former practicing naturopathic doctor, I have had the benefit of working with patients and have seen firsthand how ginkgo biloba can be effective in improving cognitive function.\"\n\nGinkgo biloba is believed to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that protect cell membranes and help govern the workings of the brain's chemical messengers, or neurotransmitters.\n\nDr. Lon S. Schneider, director of the state of California's Alzheimer's Disease Research and Clinical Center at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, said that these findings were \"straightforward and expected.\"\n\nNo measurable effect from ginkgo is seen on cognition, Schneider said. \"Regardless of whether people say 'I take it and I feel better,' you just don't see an effect,\" he said.\n\nStill, Schneider won't object if someone wants to try it. \"It is not in my position to deflate hope,\" he said. \"If someone really feels they need to take this and they need to try it, well go ahead and do it.

People don't even like to say the word out loud.\n\nThe good news, we're told, is that there are many things we can do \u2013 or not do \u2013 in our adult lives to lower our risk of developing different types of cancer. Want to avoid lung cancer? Don't smoke. Want to lower your risk of skin cancer? Stay out of the sun, or utilize a proper sunscreen.\n\nBut a new study published Monday in Cancer suggests that at least one decision our parents make FOR us may have an impact on our predisposition to certain types of cancer.\n\nResearchers at the University of Washington School of Medicine and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center looked at the association between circumcision and the prevalence of prostate cancer. They concluded that circumcision before first sexual intercourse is associated with a 15% reduction in the relative risk of developing prostate cancer.\n\nIt's important to note, right off the bat, that this study is not purporting to establish a cause and effect relationship. As is often the case, there are many additional factors at play.\n\nFirst, a bit of background. It has long been established that men who are uncircumcised are more prone to contracting sexually transmitted infections. As the study's authors point out, \"The mechanism(s) by which circumcision reduced acquisition of an STI [sexually transmitted infection] is thought to be related to the microenvironment of the thin, lightly keratinized mucosal lining of the inner foreskin.\"\n\nThis tissue is subject to small tears that allow potential access of pathogens into the bloodstream. Furthermore, \"The moist environment under the preputial skin may help pathogens survive for extended periods prior to direct infection.\" Circumcision, of course, removes this protective environment.\n\nWhy is this important? Infections are reported to cause almost 20% of cancers worldwide, either directly by infection, or indirectly via inflammation. Several STIs \u2013 such as gonorrhea, Chlamydia, HPV & HIV \u2013 have been found in the prostate.\n\nParticipants in the study were asked about their family\u2019s medical history, which may increase a man\u2019s risk of developing prostate cancer, and their PSA screening history, which can lead to overdiagnosis of the condition. Men were also asked to self-report their circumcision status, number of sexual partners, and their history of STIs.\n\nCircumcision was reported in 68.8% of the cases and 71.5% of the controls. Caucasian men more commonly reported circumcision (69%) than African American men (43%). For 91% who reported circumcision, the procedure was performed shortly after birth.\n\nA few potential caveats to note include the reliance on self-reporting when it comes to a man's history of STIs, as well as his sexual partners. A cursory review of the data suggests, for example, that the number of male sexual partners is greatly underreported. Male-to-male sexual activity has been shown to lead to an increased rate in STIs, including HIV.\n\nThis gives pause to make one wonder what other facts were underreported, though the numbers of circumcised vs. not circumcised do fall in line with national survey results.\n\nThe bottom line from the American Cancer Society: While this is an interesting finding, it's not likely to spur any change in recommendations or medical practice.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The availability of circumcisions is not in question.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "ViewRay, Inc. (Nasdaq: VRAY), maker of the world's first and only clinical MRI-guided radiation therapy system, announced today outcomes data presented during the recent 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO). This data highlighted compelling early results using the company's MRIdian system for the treatment of inoperable, locally advanced pancreatic cancer.\n\nUnlike any other system on the market today, MRIdian allows clinicians to see the tumor and nearby soft-tissue anatomy throughout radiation treatments using real-time diagnostic MR-visualization. As a result, MRIdian's on-table adaptive radiation therapy allows doctors to respond to subtle anatomical changes observed on a day-to-day basis and reshape the dose to better match the current contours of the tumor. By more accurately targeting the tumor, and reducing treatment radiation dose to surrounding organs such as the duodenum, small bowel, stomach and liver, a higher and potentially more effective radiation dose may be delivered without increasing the risks of side effects and complications for the patient.\n\nAs featured in the ASTRO Scientific Session poster titled \"High Dose Adaptive MRI Guided Radiation Therapy Improves Overall Survival of Inoperable Pancreatic Cancer,\" key data points and findings from the presentation include the following:\n\u2022 The study detailed a retrospective review of 42 locally-advanced pancreatic cancer patients treated with MRIdian at four institutions (University of California Los Angeles, University of Wisconsin, VU University Medical Center, Washington University).\n\u2022 The authors examined survival and toxicity rates for two unique cohorts of patients. One sample received a higher biologically effective dose (maxBED10 >90), primarily enabled by MRIdian MR-guided on-table adaptive radiotherapy. The other sample received a lower, more conventional biologically effective dose (maxBED10 <90), using non-adaptive therapy.\n\u2022 The cohort receiving a higher dose demonstrated a near doubling of median overall survival (Kaplan-Meier estimated median overall survival of 27.8 months compared to 14.8 months).\n\u2022 Patients treated with higher radiation doses reported no grade 3 or higher toxicities (0 percent). In comparison, those patients receiving lower doses via non-adaptive treatments experienced 15.8 percent grade 3 or higher toxicities.\n\n\"High-definition MR now enables oncologists to detect the slightest anatomical changes that occur from one day to the next and in real-time while the patient is being treated. Coupled with new adaptive radiation therapy software tools, we create new customized plans in minutes, all while the patient is on the treatment table,\" said Percy Lee, M.D., senior author and Associate Professor and Vice Chair of Education for the Department of Radiation Oncology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. \"The data presented at the 2017 ASTRO Annual Meeting suggests that higher radiation doses with adaptive MR guided radiation therapy may improve survival in pancreatic cancer while maintaining a very favorable toxicity profile. These outcomes warrant further investigations.\"\n\nThe early results highlighted above, along with other data obtained using MRIdian will be tested in a multi-center, prospective, single-arm clinical trial for inoperable, locally advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. The trial will be conducted by ViewRay's Clinical Cooperative Think Tank (C2T2), a group of MRIdian medical institutions focused on evidence gathering to support MR-guided radiation therapy.\n\nFor more information regarding this clinical trial, please visit http://go. .\n\nPresentations discussing the multi-institutional poster in ViewRay's ASTRO booth are available on the company's website at http://www. .\n\nViewRay\u00ae, Inc.

For one thing, it can be the factor that sends someone to get a genetic test in the first place. For another, people in many parts of the world don\u2019t have access to genetic tests at all.\n\nThat\u2019s inspired years of effort to train a computer to do the same thing. Software that analyzes a patient\u2019s face for signs of disease could help clinicians better diagnose and treat people with genetic syndromes.\n\nSome older attempts at facial analysis relied on large, clunky scanners \u2014 a tool better suited to a lab, not the field. Now, in the era of smartphones, such efforts have a whole new promise. Face2Gene, a program developed by Boston-based startup FDNA, has a mobile app that clinicians can use to snap photos of their patients and get a list of syndromes they might have.\n\nMeanwhile, Muenke and his colleagues at the NIH last month published an important advance: the ability to diagnose disease in a non-Caucasian face.\n\nIt\u2019s a promising preliminary sign. But if facial recognition software is to be widely useful for diagnoses, software developers and geneticists will need to work together to overcome genetics\u2019 systemic blind spots.\n\nThe algorithms in general work on the same principles: measuring the size of facial features and their placement to detect patterns. They\u2019re both trained on databases of photographs doctors take of their patients. The NIH works with partners around the world to collect their photos; FDNA accepts photos uploaded to Face2Gene.\n\nBut they differ in a key way: Whereas the algorithm the NIH uses can predict if someone has a given genetic disorder, the Face2Gene algorithm spits out not diagnoses, but probabilities. The app describes photos as being a certain percent similar to photos of people with one of the 2,000 disorders for which Face2Gene has image data, based on the overall \u201clook\u201d of the face as well as the presence of certain features. However, the app won\u2019t give clinicians a yes or no answer to the question of, \u201cDoes my patient have a genetic disorder?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s intentional. Face2Gene is meant to be more like a search engine for diseases \u2014 a means to an end.\n\n\u201cWe are not a diagnostic tool, and we will never be a diagnostic tool,\u201d said FDNA CEO Dekel Gelbman.\n\nDrawing that bright line between Face2Gene and \u201ca diagnostic tool\u201d allows FDNA to stay compliant with FDA regulations governing mobile medical apps while avoiding some of the regulatory burden associated with smartphone-based diagnostic tools.\n\nThe algorithm the NIH uses \u2014 developed by scientists at Children\u2019s National Health System in Washington, D.C., \u2014 seems to work pretty well so far: In 129 cases of Down syndrome, it accurately detected the disorder 94 percent of the time. For DiGeorge syndrome, the numbers were even higher: It had a 95 percent accuracy rate across all 156 cases.\n\nFace2Gene declined to provide similar numbers for their technology. \u201cSince Face2Gene is a search and reference informational tool, the terms sensitivity and specificity are difficult to apply to our output,\u201d Gelbman cautioned.\n\nBut there\u2019s one big stumbling block for both of them, a problem that has dogged medical genetics for decades: Data for non-white populations is sorely lacking.\n\n\u201cIn every single textbook, the ones we had [when I trained] in Germany and the major textbooks here in the US, there are photos of individuals of northern European descent,\u201d Muenke said. \u201cWhen I told this to my boss, he said there have to be atlases for children from diverse backgrounds. And there aren\u2019t. There just aren\u2019t.\u201d (Today there is that resource, based on Muenke and the NIH\u2019s work.)\n\nSo diagnosing diseases from a face alone presents an additional challenge in countries where the majority of the population isn\u2019t of northern European descent, because some facial areas that vary with ethnic background can often overlap with areas that signify a genetic disorder. Eventually, the software will also have to be able to tackle people with mixed ethnic backgrounds, too. \u201cWe have thought about it but haven\u2019t gone there yet,\u201d Muenke said.\n\nFor example, children with Down syndrome often have flat nasal bridges \u2014 as do typically developing African or African-American children. Across different races and ethnicities of children there were only two reliable identifiers that could be used to diagnose Down syndrome \u2014 the angles between landmark points on the child\u2019s nose and eye, according to a paper Muenke and Marius Linguraru at Children\u2019s National published with their colleagues earlier this year. All of the other \u201ctypical\u201d features weren\u2019t significantly more likely to show up when children were compared to ethnically matched controls.\n\nIn fact, using a Caucasian face as a reference can sometimes be the least representative choice. \u201cOne of the findings that I\u2019m very interested in [in] our recent study was that the population that we found to be most different from the others, in terms of facial patterns characteristic of DiGeorge syndrome, was the Caucasian population,\u201d Linguraru said.\n\nTo continue to fix this problem, both the NIH and Face2Gene need help from more researchers who can upload more patients\u2019 faces \u2014 but that\u2019s easier said than done. Confirming a suspected disorder with genetic tests is standard practice today, and there are no genetic labs based in Africa registered in the NIH\u2019s Genetic Testing Registry. Asia and South America are also relatively underserved.\n\nThose numbers also reflect the general patterns of distribution for medical geneticists. \u201cMost practitioners are located in North America and Europe,\u201d Gelbman said. Nigeria, for example, doesn\u2019t have a single medical geneticist in the entire country.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that might change, with time and effort. In addition to his work as a researcher, Muenke directs a program that brings health care professionals from developing countries to the US for a month-long crash course in medical genetics. (The program is funded by the NIH\u2019s Fogarty International Center; President Trump eliminated funding for the center in his 2018 \u201cskinny\u201d budget proposal announced in March.)\n\nFor now, both algorithms have shown that they can handle a diverse patient set. FDNA scientists published a paper in January showing that their algorithm could better identify Down syndrome after being trained with a more diverse set of faces, and Muenke and Linguraru have also published papers this year demonstrating their algorithm\u2019s ability to identify genetic disorders correctly in children across a variety of ethnic backgrounds.\n\nAs both groups work on recruiting more researchers, they are also working to push their tech forward. FDNA is working on establishing partnerships with pharmaceutical companies to start their commercial outreach. In theory, these partnerships could contribute to precision medicine efforts or help companies develop new therapies for rare diseases.\n\nMeanwhile, Linguraru has his eyes on eventual FDA approval for the algorithm the NIH has used.

Smoking cigarettes causes 480,000 premature deaths each year due mainly to a two-fold risk of cardiovascular disease and a 20-fold risk of lung cancer. In a commentary published in the current issue of the American Journal of Medicine, researchers from the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine at Florida Atlantic University reassure clinicians and their patients that varenicline, whose brand name is Chantix, is a safe and effective way to achieve smoking cessation and that failure to use this drug has caused preventable heart attacks and deaths from cardiovascular disease.\n\nIn 2006, varenicline was approved as a safe and effective means to quit smoking and achieved permanent quit rates of approximately 25 percent. In 2009, however, varenicline received a black box warning by the FDA based on their adverse event reports of neuropsychiatric symptoms like depression and thoughts of suicide.\n\nThere were plausible alternative explanations including that nearly half of the subjects had psychiatric histories, 42 percent were taking psychotropic drugs and about 42 percent were suffering from depression. Nonetheless, since then, there has been a 76 percent decline in the number of prescriptions dispensed from a peak of about 2 million in the last quarter of 2007 to about 531,000 in the first quarter of 2014.\n\nIn their commentary, the FAU researchers emphasize that, until recently, the totality of randomized evidence on varenicline had been restricted to eight small trials, which did not demonstrate a hazard. The researchers caution that the reliable detection of small to moderate risks and benefits of drug therapies requires cogent data from large-scale randomized trials designed a priori to test the hypothesis.\n\nSuch a large randomized trial was recently completed that included both apparently healthy individuals as well as those with severe mental illness. The trial was conducted for 12 weeks on about 8,000 long-term smokers and included equal subgroups of those without as well as with psychiatric disorders. In subjects without psychiatric disorders, those treated with varenicline had less neuropsychiatric symptoms and in subjects without psychiatric disorders there were no increases in these symptoms. Both groups of participants assigned at random to varenicline achieved significantly higher abstinence rates at 12 weeks than those assigned to placebo, nicotine patch or bupropion. Just a few months ago, the FDA removed the black box warning from varenicline.\n\nThe commentary was coauthored by Dianna Gaballa, a fourth-year medical student; Joanna Drowos, D.O., M.P.H., an associate professor of integrated medical science and associate chair of the Department of Integrated Medical Science; and Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., Dr.P.H., the first Sir Richard Doll Professor and senior academic advisor to the dean, all in FAU's Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine.\n\n\"The existing totality of evidence suggests an urgent need to increase the use of varenicline in the general population as well as in those with serious mental illness who on average die about 20 years earlier than the general population, in part, because their smoking rates may be as high as 75 percent,\" said Hennekens.\n\nQuitting smoking significantly reduces risks of cardiovascular disease beginning within a matter of months and reaching the non-smoker status within a few years, even among older adults. For lung and other cancers, however, reductions do not even begin to emerge for years after quitting and, even after 10 years, quitters achieve death rates only about midway between the continuing smoker and non-smoker.\n\n\"For reducing risks of cardiovascular disease it's never too late to quit, but to reduce risks of cancer, it's never too early,\" said Hennekens.\n\nThe authors speculate that if use of varenicline had not plummeted by 76 percent following the black box warning in 2009, perhaps 17,000 premature deaths from cardiovascular disease may have been avoided each year during the last few years. Public health efforts and effective cessation treatments including behavioral counseling and medication have resulted in a 14 percent decrease in smoking in the U.S. while the rates are markedly increasing in developing countries.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heart disease is the leading killer among men and women causing approximately 600,000 deaths each year.\n\nAmong the numerous honors and recognitions Hennekens has received include the Ochsner Award for reducing premature deaths from cigarettes in 2014. From 1995 to 2005, Science Watch ranked him as the third most widely cited medical researcher in the world and five of the top 20 were his former trainees and/or fellows. In 2012, Science Heroes ranked Hennekens No. 81 in the history of the world for having saved more than 1.1 million lives. In 2016, he was ranked the No. 14 \"Top Scientist in the World\" with an H-index of 173.\n\nAbout the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine:\n\nFAU's Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine is one of 145 accredited medical schools in the U.S. The college was launched in 2010, when the Florida Board of Governors made a landmark decision authorizing FAU to award the M.D. degree. After receiving approval from the Florida legislature and the governor, it became the 134th allopathic medical school in North America. With more than 70 full and part-time faculty and more than 1,300 affiliate faculty, the college matriculates 64 medical students each year and has been nationally recognized for its innovative curriculum. To further FAU's commitment to increase much needed medical residency positions in Palm Beach County and to ensure that the region will continue to have an adequate and well-trained physician workforce, the FAU Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine Consortium for Graduate Medical Education (GME) was formed in fall 2011 with five leading hospitals in Palm Beach County. In June 2014, FAU's College of Medicine welcomed its inaugural class of 36 residents in its first University-sponsored residency in internal medicine.\n\nFlorida Atlantic University, established in 1961, officially opened its doors in 1964 as the fifth public university in Florida. Today, the University, with an annual economic impact of $6.3 billion, serves more than 30,000 undergraduate and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region in southeast Florida. FAU's world-class teaching and research faculty serves students through 10 colleges: the Dorothy F. Schmidt College of Arts and Letters, the College of Business, the College for Design and Social Inquiry, the College of Education, the College of Engineering and Computer Science, the Graduate College, the Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College, the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine, the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing and the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science. FAU is ranked as a High Research Activity institution by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. The University is placing special focus on the rapid development of critical areas that form the basis of its strategic plan: Healthy aging, biotech, coastal and marine issues, neuroscience, regenerative medicine, informatics, lifespan and the environment. These areas provide opportunities for faculty and students to build upon FAU's existing strengths in research and scholarship.

But most of the success so far has been with blood cancers like lymphomas and leukemias. Immunotherapy, as it\u2019s called, has yet to prove itself with solid tumors like breast, prostate, lung, colon and brain cancers.\n\nBut in a report published in the , researchers led by Dr. Behnam Badie from the City of Hope Beckman Research Institute and Medical Center say that the same immune-based therapy that is successful against blood cancers also helped a patient with advanced brain cancer.\n\nThe 50-year-old man with glioblastoma, a particularly aggressive type of brain tumor, had already been treated with surgery, radiation and anti-tumor drug therapies. Despite these treatments, his cancer had returned and also spread to other parts of his brain and spinal cord. Badie and his team extracted immune cells from him, then engineered them to express proteins on their surface that would recognize and destroy glioblastoma tumor cells. After surgery to remove the bulk of the brain tumor, Badie and his colleagues directly injected the site with the modified immune cells (called chimeric antigen receptor T cells, or CAR T cells) six times, and the remaining part of this tumor stopped growing.\n\nOther smaller growths in the brain continued to grow, however, so the patient received 10 more doses of the CAR T cells injected into the cavities in the brain, called the ventricles. This is the first time that immune cells have been injected into these brain regions, because introducing anything into the ventricles can cause dangerous and possibly deadly inflammation. The man did not develop such serious complications, however, and after about four months, these tumors too started to shrink. By six months, almost all had disappeared.\n\nIf the patient had not received the CAR T therapy, he likely would only have survived a few weeks after his cancer recurred, says Badie. But after being treated with the immune therapy, his cancer did not grow or recur for nearly eight months. \u201cIf we can do the same for other patients, that would be an amazing accomplishment that many decades of work and research on glioblastoma have never done,\u201d says Badie, whose own father passed away a decade ago from glioblastoma.\n\nThe patient is one of nine in the trial, and so far, many of the other people are having similar experiences on the therapy. Based on this man\u2019s case, his team is hoping to now inject not just the tumor site but also the ventricular space in the brain, since that may help control spread of the cancer.\n\nIt\u2019s also becoming clear that more than one type of modified immune cells may have to be enlisted. The tumors in the first patient remained under control for almost eight months, but the cancer returned after that in new parts of the brain. Badie says it\u2019s not obvious why, but his analysis showed that these tumors did not contain much of the protein targeted by the CAR T cells that were injected. It\u2019s possible that the immune cells had destroyed most of the cancer cells expressing the original protein, so other cancer cells with other proteins began to proliferate and survive.\n\nBadie is hoping to take advantage of this information and introduce immune cells with different tumor-targeting proteins. Eventually, these proteins would also be tailored to be specific to each patient\u2019s cancer \u2014 a precision medicine approach to controlling cancer. These results are the first encouraging sign that the immunotherapy that is helping more people with blood cancer might also be effective for people with solid tumors like brain cancers.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The article makes clear that the therapy is experimental, that complexities are numerous, that much is still unknown, and the trial is ongoing.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands: A test that measures the levels of five chemicals in the breath has shown promising results for the detection of cancers of the oesophagus and stomach in a large patient trial presented at the European Cancer Congress 2017 [1].\n\nTogether, stomach and oesophageal cancer account for around 1.4 million new cancer diagnoses each year worldwide [2]. Both tend to be diagnosed late, because the symptoms are ambiguous, meaning the five-year survival rate for these two types of cancer is only 15%.\n\nThe new research, involving more than 300 patients, showed that the test could diagnose cancer with an overall accuracy of 85%.\n\nDr Sheraz Markar, an NIHR Clinical Trials Fellow from Imperial College London, under the supervision of Professor George Hanna, told the Congress: \"At present the only way to diagnose oesophageal cancer or stomach cancer is with endoscopy. This method is expensive, invasive and has some risk of complications.\n\n\"A breath test could be used as a non-invasive, first-line test to reduce the number of unnecessary endoscopies. In the longer term this could also mean earlier diagnosis and treatment, and better survival.\"\n\nThe trial was based on the results of previous research that suggested differences in the levels of specific chemicals (butyric, pentanoic and hexanoic acids, butanal, and decanal) between patients with stomach or oesophageal cancer and patients with upper gastrointestinal symptoms without cancer. The new research aimed to test whether this 'chemical signature' that seemed to typify cancer could be the basis of a diagnostic test.\n\nIn the new study, the research team collected breath samples from 335 people at St Mary's Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust; University College London Hospital; and the Royal Marsden Hospital, London. Of these, 163 had been diagnosed with stomach or oesophageal cancer and 172 showed no evidence of cancer when they had an endoscopy.\n\nAll the samples were analysed with a technique called selected ion flow-tube mass spectrometry, which is able to accurately measure small amounts of different chemicals in mixtures of gases such as breath.\n\nResearchers measured the levels of the five chemicals in each sample to see which ones matched to the 'chemical signature' that indicated cancer.\n\nThe results showed that the test was 85% accurate overall, with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 81%. This means that not only was the breath test good at picking up those who had cancer (sensitivity), it was also good at correctly identifying who did not have cancer (specificity).\n\nDr Markar said: \"Because cancer cells are different to healthy ones, they produce a different mixture of chemicals. This study suggests that we may be able detect these differences and use a breath test to indicate which patients are likely to have cancer of the oesophagus and stomach, and which do not. However, these findings must be validated in a larger sample of patients before the test could be used in the clinic.\"\n\nOver the next three years, the researchers will continue with a larger trial, using the test with patients who are being given an endoscopy for gastrointestinal symptoms but not yet diagnosed with cancer. This will assess the ability of the test to pick up cases within a group that is likely to contain only a small percentage of cancers.\n\nThe team is also working on breath tests for other types of cancer, such as colorectal and pancreatic, which could be used as first-line tests in general practice surgeries.", "question": "Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "It is clear that the breath test is not available.

Abaloparatide works differently from Forteo and improves bone density more than Forteo, Miller said.\n\nWomen taking abaloparatide also had fewer other types of fractures (2.7 percent) than those who got a placebo (4.7 percent) and slightly fewer than those on Forteo (3.3 percent), the researchers found.\n\nMiller said many spine fractures are painless. Patients are often unaware they have happened until a doctor measures their height and finds they are up to an inch shorter than before, he said.\n\nAbaloparatide and Forteo are synthetic peptides that help grow and strengthen bone, Miller said.\n\nAlong with building bone density, they are the only ones that increase bone quality, he said. \"Bone quality is an important aspect of bone strength -- the ability to withstand a break,\" Miller said.\n\nHe predicts that when abaloparatide is on the market, it will compete with Forteo, driving down the price of both drugs.\n\n\"I am hoping that having a second drug available, that it will help reduce the cost,\" he said. \"Forteo costs about $2,500 a month if you don't have insurance.\" Even if a patient is insured, monthly copays can range from $30 to $400. Forteo is covered by Medicare, Miller said.\n\nThe report was published Aug. 16 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nA study based on 2010 U.S. Census data estimated that more than 3 million women between the ages of 50 and 69 have osteoporosis. A 60-year-old woman has a 44 percent lifetime risk of fracture due to low bone density.\n\nFor the study, Miller and colleagues randomly assigned nearly 2,500 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to receive daily injections of abaloparatide, Forteo or a placebo for 18 months. Their average age was 69.\n\nAmong the nearly 2,000 women who completed the trial, increases in bone mineral density were greater with abaloparatide than placebo, the researchers found.\n\nIn addition, fewer cases of hypercalcemia (abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood) occurred among women taking abaloparatide (3 percent) than Forteo (6 percent). Hypercalcemia can weaken bones, cause kidney stones and interfere with heart and brain function.\n\nThere were no differences among the groups in other serious side effects, such as nausea and heart palpations, Miller said.\n\nDr. Caroline Messer, director of the Center for Pituitary and Neuroendocrine Disorders at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, is eager for further research. There needs to be a large head-to-head trial between Forteo and abaloparatide, she said, to really see which drug is better.\n\n\"Everybody is going to want to know if this is inferior or superior to Forteo,\" she said, adding that this is an early study. \"It shows more bone building and fewer fractures than Forteo, but whether it will replace that drug is still up in the air.\"\n\nAn editorial accompanying the study said which drug is selected may be less important than identifying and starting an approved treatment.\n\n\"The bar is high for any preventive treatment -- in the efforts to prevent a fracture that may or may not ever occur, prescribers do not want to prescribe a therapy that causes a new problem. The way forward for fracture prevention involves not only the development of better therapies . . . and easier delivery systems, but also improved adoption of existing osteoporosis therapies for patients with prior fractures and minimization of adverse effects, particularly those associated with long-term use,\" the editorial said.\n\nThe editorial was co-written by Dr. Anne Cappola of the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, associate editor of JAMA, and Dr. Dolores Shoback of the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nTo learn more about osteoporosis, visit the American College of Rheumatology.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story states that abaloparatide is currently in a Phase 3 trial stage.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The findings were released at a news briefing held in advance of the annual meeting of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) in San Diego.\n\nBut if the findings are confirmed, \"patients who are taking aspirin for other reasons may see an added benefit,\" says study head Kevin Choe, MD, a radiation oncologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas.\n\nResearchers stress the findings are preliminary and that men with the cancer should not reach for the aspirin bottle in an attempt to improve their health.\n\nOct. 25, 2010 -- Aspirin , already linked in some studies to a lower risk of developing colon cancer , may also cut the risk of dying of prostate cancer by more than half, a large study suggests.\n\nStudies have shown that people with cancer are more prone to blood clots and that people with blood clots are at increased risk of cancer.

Flu patch may take sting out of your fears\n\nIn what would be a boon for needle-phobes of all ages, researchers have developed a skin patch that vaccinates against the flu and could be available in five years.\n\nThe patch, which is lined with microscopic needles that dissolve into the skin, could provide a painless alternative to hypodermic needles and make visits to the doctor's office or clinic for a traditional flu shot a thing of the past. The patch is as easy to apply as a Band-Aid.\n\n\"We've now demonstrated a technology that can enable painless, self-administered flu vaccination,\" said Mark Prausnitz, a professor in the Georgia Tech School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and leader in the research. \"It appears to vaccinate against influenza at least as well and probably better than a traditional hypodermic needle.\"\n\nVaccination that doesn't require trained personnel holds great appeal because it would likely boost the nation's low immunization rates, a source of concern.\n\nAlthough influenza kills more than 30,000 people most years and the government recommends most healthy people get vaccinated annually, fewer than 40 percent typically do.\n\nIn a mouse study reported Sunday in the online edition of Nature Medicine, Prausnitz's team found the patch improved the immune system's antibody memory and was more efficient at clearing the lungs of the flu virus, compared to a placebo and hypodermic needle-delivered vaccine.\n\nPrausnitz attributed the better performance to the skin's abundance of the types of cells most adept at generating immune responses. The muscle into which needles deliver vaccine is not nearly as active immunologically.\n\nPatches in the mouse study contained an array of 100 needles, each some 650 microns in length, or about the width of a few strands of human hair. Coated with inactivated flu virus, the patches are pressed manually into the skin, where the microneedles dissolve into bodily fluids.\n\n\"It's a technological approach that makes a lot of sense,\" said Dr. Jan Drutz, a general pediatrician at Texas Children's Hospital who calls needle-phobia common in both kids and adults. \"It would be a wonderful alternative to needles if it truly works in people and is pain free.\"\n\nNeedle-phobia, or trypanophobia, is a recognized medical condition that causes sufferers to avoid medical care. It is estimated to affect more than 10 percent of the adult population.\n\nIn the study, one group of mice received the influenza vaccine from traditional hypodermic needles; another group received the vaccine through the dissolving microneedles; and a control group received the microneedle patches not containing any vaccine.\n\nInfected with the influenza virus 30 days later, both groups that received the vaccine remained healthy while mice in the control group contracted the flu and died.\n\nThree months after vaccination, researchers exposed a different group of immunized mice to the flu virus and found that those who received the microneedles did better than those injected by the hypodermic needles.\n\nNoting that mice are much easier to vaccinate against the flu than humans, Baylor College of Medicine influenza expert Dr. Paul Glezen expressed skepticism about the patch until seeing it in human trials. But he said it will be interesting to watch.\n\nPrausnitz said he hopes to be testing the patch in people in two years and have a product on the shelves in five. He also said that although initially there will be start-up costs, he thinks the price will be no more than traditional flu vaccines once it is mass-produced.\n\nThe microneedle technology may also be used for other vaccinations, such as polio and measles, said Prausnitz.

The data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nFor the study, Cao and her colleagues collected data on 82,600 women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study in 1980 and 47,650 men enrolled in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study in 1986. The researchers collected data on aspirin use, risk factors for cancer and diagnoses of cancer.\n\nAfter up to 32 years of follow-up, about 20,400 women and 7,570 men developed cancer, the investigators found. Among men, prostate cancer was excluded.\n\nCao's team found that men and women who took a regular dose of aspirin (325 milligrams) two times a week or more had a lower risk of cancer overall than people who did not regularly take aspirin. The reduced risk was largely due to fewer cases of gastrointestinal cancers, including colon cancer, rectal cancer and esophageal cancer.\n\nRegular aspirin use was not associated with a reduced risk of other cancers. Specifically, no link was found between aspirin use and a lower risk of breast cancer, advanced prostate cancer or lung cancer, the researchers said.\n\nMoreover, the benefit of aspirin in reducing overall cancer risk appeared to depend on how much one took. So the more aspirin taken, the more the risk was reduced. Amounts ranged from less than one aspirin a week to 15 or more, the researchers said.\n\nGetting the biggest benefit from aspirin required taking it for at least 16 years. The benefit was no longer seen within four years of stopping it, the researchers found. And the study only showed an association between aspirin use and gastrointestinal cancer risk, not a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nThe association of aspirin with reduced cancer risk was the same for women and men regardless of race, history of diabetes, family history of cancer, weight, smoking, regular use of other painkillers or taking multivitamins, the study authors added.\n\nEric Jacobs, strategic director of pharmacoepidemiology at the American Cancer Society, said the new study \"confirms the now well-established link between regular aspirin use and lower risk of developing certain cancers of the gastrointestinal tract -- cancers of the colon, rectum and esophagus.\"\n\nSome, though not all, previous studies have indicated that aspirin might slightly lower risk of certain other cancers, including breast cancer, prostate cancer and lung cancer, he added.\n\n\"Although aspirin is recommended for most people who have had a heart attack, and has some benefits for cancer risk as well, at this point the American Cancer Society does not recommend that people use aspirin specifically to prevent cancer because it is not clear that the benefits with respect to cancer outweigh the risks,\" Jacobs said.\n\nWhile not common, aspirin can cause serious, even occasionally fatal, stomach bleeding, even at low doses, he said.\n\n\"People who are uncertain about whether they should be using aspirin should talk to their health care provider, who knows their personal medical history and can help weigh their individual risks and benefits,\" Jacobs said.\n\nVisit the U.S. National Cancer Institute for more on aspirin and cancer risk.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "No explicit mention is made of aspirin\u2019s availability, but the drug is widely known to be commonly available, and the story certainly conveys that impression.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "BOSTON (Reuters) - If you\u2019re checking into the hospital for surgery, doctors may soon be swabbing your nose in an effort to prevent an infection from appearing after your operation.\n\nResearchers in the Netherlands said on Wednesday they were able to cut the risk of a common bacterium by nearly 60 percent by first looking for signs of it in the nose and then treating it with an antibiotic nasal gel and full body wash.\n\nThe treatment combination also shaved two days off a typical 14-day stay in the hospital.\n\nHospital-acquired infections are a major problem in medicine, so doctors are always looking for the best way to reduce the risk.\n\nAbout 27 million surgeries are done just in the United States each year, and in as many as half a million cases, infections occur at the site of surgery.\n\nUp to 30 percent of those infections are caused by strains of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, which otherwise benignly resides in the nose and on the skin.\n\nThe new study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, used a rapid test to identify which patients, most of whom were scheduled to undergo surgery, had the bacteria in at least one nostril.\n\nThe 504 patients treated with the antibiotic nose gel mupirocin, also known as Bactroban, and washed with chlorhexidine, a common ingredient in mouthwash, developed an S. aureus infection 3.4 percent of the time. The rate for 413 volunteers given placebo treatment was 7.7 percent.\n\nThe research team, led by Dr. Lonneke Bode of Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, estimated that 250 patients would need to be screened to prevent one infection.\n\n\u201cPreventing one infection will pay for thousands of these screenings,\u201d Dr. Henri Verbrugh of Erasmus, a coauthor of the study, said in a telephone interview.\n\nInfections are also a problem when doctors put tubes into the body.

Made from parallel strands of the protein collagen, it refracts light to focus images on the retina.\n\nAlthough the fragile film is easily destroyed by trauma or infection, replacement human corneas can be used to restore vision, although this depends on a steady supply of donors.\n\nA team led by Griffith and Per Fagerholm, an ophthalmology professor and eye surgeon at Linkoping University in Sweden, conducted the study by removing diseased tissue from the corneas of 10 patients and replacing them with biosynthetic implants designed to mimic a normal human cornea.\n\nFor the process they used recombinant human collagen, a substance synthesized in the laboratory to mimic human tissue and supplied by the San Francisco biotech firm FibroGen Inc.\n\nThe patients were monitored for two years after surgery. The researchers found that, eventually, the cells and nerves from nine of the 10 patients regrew completely and packed themselves into the implant, resulting in a kind of \u201cregenerated\u201d cornea that looked and functioned like normal, healthy eye tissue.\n\nThe biosynthetic corneas also became sensitive to touch and the treated eyes began producing normal tears, the researchers said. Vision improved in six of the 10 patients.\n\nAfter the patients were also fitted with contact lenses, which is common after corneal transplants, their vision was comparable with that of patients who undergo regular human corneal tissue transplants.\n\n\u201cThe results were pretty encouraging and there is great potential here,\u201d Fagerholm said in a telephone interview.\n\nLoss of vision due to corneal disease or trauma affects over 10 million people a year, but lack of access to donor tissue limits the number of transplants, particularly in poorer countries.\n\nIn the United States, an estimated 42,000 corneal grafts a year are performed using tissue from posthumous donors, but there are sometimes problems with rejection and experts say failure rates are significant.\n\nFagerholm said the patients in this trial had no problems with rejection and did not need long-term immune suppression drugs to help their bodies accept the corneas.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "There is no discussion of the availability.

An estimated 5 million people in the world have an eye disease called trachoma that affects the cornea, and another 1.5 million to 2 million are thought to have developed cornea-related blindness through other diseases or trauma.\n\nFor more than a century, doctors have considered transplantation of corneal tissue from deceased donors to be the best treatment, the study authors wrote. Artificial corneas are another option, but they're difficult to implant into the eye and can cause side effects, the researchers said.\n\nIn the new study, researchers tested corneal implants that are \"biosynthetic,\" meaning they're created with the help of living tissues. In this case, the corneas are produced with the help of human collagen -- a kind of protein -- that's grown in yeast. The mock corneas were then placed into the eyes of 10 patients after the diseased corneas were removed.\n\n\"We were pleasantly surprised that in six patients, vision improved from about 20/400 to 20/100, meaning that these patients could see objects four times farther away than before the operation,\" said Griffith, director of the Integrative Regenerative Medicine Center at Linkoping University in Sweden.\n\nThe researchers went one step further and gave contact lenses to the patients. With the lenses in place, they all had improved vision, Griffith said.\n\nWhy didn't they all get better vision immediately without the contact lenses? \"We believe that sutures used in this study resulted in roughness on the surface,\" Griffith said. \"The contact lenses compensated for the surface roughness, resulting in improved vision. We will use less disruptive sutures in our next clinical study, and this should correct this problem.\"\n\nAs for side effects, Griffith said the patients didn't report any pain or discomfort, and there were no signs that their bodies tried to reject the corneas, a risk that people face when they get transplanted organs.\n\nAs for cost, Griffith said the biosynthetic corneas \"in theory\" should be cheaper than donated corneas. Griffith said a German study recently found that donated corneas cost about $2,500.\n\nThe next step in research, Griffith said, is to create a \"new generation\" of cornea implants and test them on a wider variety of patients.\n\nThe study appears in the Aug. 25 issue of Science Translational Medicine.\n\nDr. Mark J.

Cowen & Co estimates that use of DNA blood tests for cancer screening will exceed $10 billion a year by the end of the decade.\n\nBut the move by Pathway, a privately owned maker of genetic tests ranging from cancer risk and heart health to drug response, underscores a growing debate over how much genetic information should be made available to healthy people if it is not yet clear how it can improve their health.\n\nThe company has already run into trouble on a similar issue. In 2010, Walgreens pulled Pathway\u2019s genetic testing kits from its pharmacies after U.S. health regulators warned patients might take action without understanding the results.\n\nSeveral oncology experts said liquid biopsy tests like Pathway\u2019s, while exciting, still require large clinical studies proving they help people beat cancer through early detection. Doctors will also need a clear assessment of their accuracy.\n\n\u201cFor any given test, the rate of false positives causing unnecessary alarm and false negatives that provide false security should be known,\u201d said Dr. Keith Stewart, an oncologist who heads Mayo Clinic\u2019s Center for Individualized Medicine.\n\nPathway\u2019s screening test looks at 96 genetic markers associated with major cancer types such as breast, ovarian, lung, colon and melanoma. The company is focusing on mutations that are relatively well-understood, and for which there are specific treatments, said Chief Executive Jim Plante.\n\nThe cost to consumers begins at $299 to periodically check for DNA in their blood that could act as an early warning sign of cancer. The tests must be ordered by a doctor, based on a patient\u2019s risk profile. A positive test will require additional checks to find where the cancer is growing.\n\nPathway also launched a blood test for patients already diagnosed with cancer to help determine whether a treatment is working, or whether the disease is likely to return.\n\nScientists have long known that cancers shed bits of genetic material into the blood. Privately held Guardant Health and Personal Genome Diagnostics Inc already offer blood tests for cancer patients. Roche-backed Foundation Medicine Inc, Genomic Health Inc, Illumina Inc and Sequenom Inc say they have similar tests in the works.\n\nBut cancer experts say there are major differences between using such tests to screen for cancer and monitoring patients who are already known to have it.\n\nFor example, some early cancers may not secrete DNA fragments into the bloodstream and require other types of detection. A colonoscopy can find and remove polyps before they pose a threat as colon cancer.\n\n\u201cIf we are relying on a test that can only detect cancer after it has formed, we miss a huge opportunity to intervene,\u201d said Dr. Scott Kopetz of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.\n\nPatients might be attracted to a less-invasive test for colon cancer, but if it is less effective, it might result in more cases of colon cancer, not fewer.\n\nAnother concern is that the tests may pick up on markers that are never destined to be cancer, something already known to occur in blood tests for prostate cancer, Kopetz said.\n\nPathway says its test is more than 99 percent accurate in detecting mutations in blood samples that contain at least nine copies of a tested mutation.\n\n\u201cWe do expect to detect cancer DNA when the tumors are small - much sooner than stage three or four,\u201d Plante said.\n\nDr. Bert Vogelstein, a cancer geneticist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, said Pathway\u2019s figure represents the test\u2019s technical ability to detect DNA in the blood.\n\nDoctors, however, need an indication of how many patients will get a false positive result, something that can only be determined in a very large clinical trial, said Vogelstein.

There is no correlation between getting the Gardasil vaccine and seriously adverse effects such as \u201cautoimmune diseases (including Guillain-Barre Syndrome and multiple sclerosis), anaphylaxis, venous thromboembolism, and stroke.\u201d\n\nMind you, all these things and more have been used by people who attack vaccines as an argument against it. And, just like essentially every claim made by the anti-vaccination movement, these arguments are wrong.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t stop them from making them, or from them getting attention by mainstream media; attention they most assuredly do not deserve.\n\nIt\u2019s very frustrating; mounds of data show these vaccinations are incredibly low-risk, but it only takes a little bit of doubt and fear to make vaccine rates drop. For example, a young girl died tragically not long after getting the vaccine, and it got a lot of press, but it was later found that she died of a completely unrelated cause. This, sadly, is expected; more than 178 million doses of Gardasil have been given worldwide, and given that huge number it\u2019s a statistical certainty that some young people will die not long after getting them. But as the saying goes, correlation is not causation. The vaccines are not to blame here.\n\nEven more frustrating about this vaccine is that it\u2019s being fought by an unusual group of people; while most anti-vax leanings are not affiliated with any particular political persuasion, Gardasil gets attacked additionally by conservatives who think that girls getting it will become more promiscuous, because HPV is a sexually transmitted disease.\n\nHowever, this has been shown to be false. Worse, these same people tend to promote abstinence-only education, which has been shown conclusively to be the worst possible sex education; kids taught his way tend to have more pregnancies and more STIs than ones who are taught progressive, healthy sex ed.\n\nIt\u2019s like Bizarro world, where everything is backward. All the evidence shows Gardasil to be safe and to be effective against a virus that causes horrific illnesses. It also shows that the claims made by anti-vaxxers are wrong, and that people fighting the vaccine because of their own sexual biases are making things far worse.\n\nAnd yet they dig in. They insist real science is wrong, that their anecdotes are better, that the entire medical industry is on the take (which is silly beyond reason).\n\nBut that\u2019s where we are. When it comes to health issues, especially ones tied to sexuality, reason goes out the window and emotions take over.\n\nThat\u2019s why I am very, very clear about this: I and my family are all up to date with our vaccinations, and my daughter has had all three stages of the Gardasil vaccine (we\u2019d have done that if she had been a boy, too).

Study participants who drank between less than a cup of coffee and three cups a day had 5% to 9% lower risk of dying than those who drank no coffee. Those who drank more than three cups a day did not see any benefit. The finding was murky, like previous studies, some of which suggested a benefit and some did not.\n\nBut when the researchers looked at coffee consumption only among people who said they never smoked, the relationship became clearer: Those who drank between less than a cup of coffee and three cups a day had 6% to 8% lower risk of dying than noncoffee drinkers. Those who drank three to five cups and more than five cups had 15% and 12% lower death rates.\n\n\"The lower risk of mortality is consistent with our hypothesis that coffee consumption could be good for you (because) we have published papers showing that coffee consumption is associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes and (heart) disease,\" said Ming Ding, a doctoral student in the Harvard School of Public Health department of nutrition. Ding is the lead author of the study, which was published on Monday in the journal Circulation. It might have been hard to see the link between coffee consumption and lower death rates because coffee and smoking often go hand-in-hand, and any benefits associated with the first could have been canceled out by the second. Although the study participants were asked about smoking, there might have been a tendency, especially among heavy smokers, to underestimate the average number of cigarettes they smoked per day, Ding said. It's possible that people who drink a lot of java have healthier diets overall and drink less soda, which has been linked to higher rates of death and heart disease, or that they have healthier diets overall. But that's probably not what links coffee to lower death rates -- researchers took into account the health benefits of drinking less soda and eating well. They also took into account the fact that coffee drinkers were more likely to have vices such as drinking alcohol and eating red meat. At least some of the health benefits associated with coffee consumption are probably a direct result of the ingredients in coffee, Ding said. It contains chemicals such as lignans and chlorogenic acid that could reduce inflammation and help control blood sugar, both of which could help reduce the risk of heart disease. In keeping with this possibility, Ding and her colleagues found that coffee drinkers were about 10% less likely to die of heart disease. They were also between 9% and 37% less likely to die of neurological diseases such as Parkinson's and dementia. The researchers also found that study participants who drank at least a cup of coffee a day had between 20% and 36% lower rates of suicide, although those who drank less than a cup had 36% higher rates. Several other studies have hinted at an association between coffee consumption and lower suicide rates, but it was a bit unexpected to see, Ding said. It is not clear whether chemicals in coffee have a direct effect on mental health or whether people who drink a lot of coffee have higher rates of employment or certain lifestyles that are associated with lower suicide rates, she added. Although previous studies have suggested that drinking coffee could protect against cancers such as prostate and liver, the current study did not find lower rates of cancer deaths among java drinkers. However, there may not have been a large enough number of deaths because of specific cancers, such as liver cancer, to be able to see a difference between coffee drinkers and nondrinkers, Ding said.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Coffee is widely available, and that\u2019s obvious from the story.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "MONDAY, April 19, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- An updated version of the standard prostate cancer test can help improve predictions about which men might not require immediate treatment, researchers report.\n\nThe basic test measures blood levels of prostate-specific androgen (PSA), a protein produced by prostate gland cells. But the standard PSA test cannot distinguish between cancers that grow so slowly they can safely be left alone and aggressive life-threatening tumors that call for surgery or radiation therapy.\n\nThe new test measures blood levels of three different types of PSA. Combined with annual biopsies, or tissue samples, it was about 70 percent accurate in singling out the aggressive tumors in a small study, John Hopkins University researchers were to report Sunday at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting, in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"What we have shown is that using the Prostate Health Index and tissue DNA measurement is informative in separating out patients whose cancers are likely to progress vs. those that are not likely to progress,\" said study leader Robert W. Veltri, an associate professor of urology and oncology at Hopkins.\n\nProstate Health Index is the name given to the test by Beckman Coulter Inc., which plans to market it.\n\nThe study included 71 men originally diagnosed as having small, low-grade and low-stage prostate cancer, the kind whose ultimate aggressiveness is often in doubt.\n\nCurrently, identifying the dangerous tumors in that group is no better than \"a coin-flip,\" Veltri said, and, as a result, many men and their doctors choose treatment that might be unnecessary and can cause impotence and other major problems.\n\nMen in the trial had periodic blood tests that measured three different forms of PSA, including pro-PSA, a molecule in which two of the amino acids that make up the protein have been clipped off. It is the pro-PSA level that is most valuable as a predictor, Veltri said, but it is only one part of the study.\n\nThe new PSA test is given twice a year, along with a digital rectal exam to determine the size of the tumor, and a yearly biopsy. The regimen found unfavorable indications for 39 of the cancers -- meaning progression of cancer grade or tumor size -- and favorable for the 32 others, Veltri said. \"When you combine the DNA reading and the serum Prostate Health Index, it is accurate in about 7 out of 10 cases,\" he said.\n\nBut it was a small study, and \"it will take another year or two to get enough cases to nail down the predictive index,\" Veltri said.\n\nThe Hopkins group is trying to identify other biomarkers that would improve the program's predictive value, he said. One hope is that the now-annual biopsies could be done every other year, Veltri said.\n\nThe study results have caused \"excitement,\" he said. \"Through active surveillance, we can identify a set of prostate cancer patients with low-grade tumors that may be able to have intervention deferred or delayed,\" Veltri said.\n\nThe Hopkins work was described as \"outstanding\" by Dr. William J.

And for now, the research is preliminary, so it's too early to know for sure if the treatment is appropriate to be used for any kind of depression.\n\nStill, the study suggests that brain stimulation \"not only just helps patients who haven't been able to recover from depression, but it seems to be associated with the absence of relapses.

The level of stimulation is controlled by a pacemaker-like device implanted in the chest.\n\nDeep brain stimulation has been around for more than 20 years, Mayberg said, and is commonly used to treat Parkinson's disease. The cost of the surgery is about $50,000, she said.\n\nPrevious research by Mayberg and others suggested that deep brain stimulation had potential as a treatment for depression. The St. Jude Medical Neuromodulation company, which has provided consulting fees to Mayberg and some of the other study authors, is currently recruiting patients for a study that could pave the way for its approval as a treatment for depression, Mayberg said.\n\nThe new study, which appears online Jan. 2 in the Archives of General Psychiatry, began with 10 patients with depression and seven with bipolar disorder -- a condition that causes severe mood swings and is also known as manic depression. They all received deep brain stimulation for 24 weeks after going through four weeks either with or without stimulation.\n\nMost of the patients continued to receive the treatment over two years, although researchers temporarily turned it off in three of them as part of the study before realizing that doing so caused their depression to return.\n\nThe researchers found that 18 percent of patients went into remission after 24 weeks, 36 percent (of 14 patients) after one year.

And as the first tumor-killing virus to receive the FDA\u2019s blessing, Imlygic could accelerate the development of other viral therapies.\n\n\u201cThis is huge for the whole field, and for cancer patients,\u201d said John Bell, a senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute in Canada. \u201cThe field is exploding, and this would be another arrow in the quiver that oncologists use.\u201d\n\nImlygic is part of a new group of immune-stimulating viral therapies that could change how cancer is treated and managed. One involves a genetically tweaked poliovirus being tested in patients with brain tumors, while another, based on a version of the common cold virus, is now under evaluation in people with bladder cancer.\n\nMelanoma is a deadly form of skin cancer that kills around 10,000 people per year in the United States. In a trial of 436 patients with the disease, 16 percent of participants who received Imlygic saw their tumors shrink for at least six months, compared with just 2 percent of those who received an older immune-boosting drug. Among those whose cancer had spread locally but not to internal organs, the response rate was better \u2014 33 percent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a low-toxicity treatment, and for the right patients you see quite stunning results,\u201d said Robert Coffin, a virologist who created Imlygic at BioVex, the Woburn-based company he founded.\n\nIn 2011, the California biotech giant Amgen bought BioVex \u2014 and the rights to Imlygic, known generically as talimogene laherparepvec, or T-VEC \u2014 in a deal worth up to $1 billion. Amgen will charge patients $65,000 for a course of treatment, which analysts said is in line with expectations.\n\n\u201cThese days in oncology we\u2019ve seen some prices quite a bit higher than that,\u201d said Eric Schmidt, an analyst with Cowen & Company. \u201cAnd Amgen\u2019s not a company that likes to price gouge.\u201d\n\nSchmidt said Imlygic\u2019s market potential as a standalone drug is \u201cvery, very modest. It\u2019s being developed in combination with other immunotherapies, where we think there\u2019s a little more of a commercial opportunity, but we still need to see more data.\u201d\n\nImlygic is approved for skin tumors that are inoperable in patients whose cancer has returned following surgery.\n\nSue Bohlin, a retired small-business owner in Farmingdale, N.J., is one of those patients. She received the viral therapy in early 2011 after conventional treatments failed to eliminate the skin tumors that had spread from her back to her breast.\n\n\u201cThe first time I took it, I got a really serious case of the chills and a high fever, but only for six or eight hours,\u201d said Bohlin, now 62. \u201cAfter that, there were no side effects.\u201d\n\nSuch muted side effects point to a major benefit of this new approach, doctors and patients said. Aside from chills and fever, the other common symptom cited in the study was skin irritation.\n\nBohlin\u2019s doctors planned to inject each of her tumor sites every two weeks, but after several rounds of treatments more tumors appeared. In a last-ditch effort meant to jump-start Bohlin\u2019s immune system, they injected her on consecutive weeks. The tumors started shrinking in the following weeks, and about three months later they were gone.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re on the cusp of potentially curing patients\u201d with these viruses and other immune therapies, said Dr. Howard Kaufman, chief surgical officer of the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey and a lead researcher on Bohlin\u2019s trial. \u201cBut short of that, this might be like diabetes, where we can control it and people live normal lives.\u201d\n\nImlygic is based on a form of the herpes simplex virus that commonly causes cold sores. It is genetically altered to replicate only in tumor cells while also producing a protein that activates T-cells, the search-and-destroy specialists of the immune system. Those T-cells pick up melanoma cells\u2019 molecular scent and hunt them down before going off in search of tumor cells hiding elsewhere in the body.\n\n\u201cThis wakes up the immune system and says, \u2018Hey!

These therapies typically open gateways that tumors have used to block immune cells.\n\nIn one small study of 19 advanced melanoma patients treated with both Imlygic and a checkpoint inhibitor called Yervoy, nearly half of the patients responded. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing short of dramatic,\u201d said Dr. Jason Chesney, an oncologist at the University of Louisville, who is involved in running a larger, follow-up study of this combination approach.\n\nJohn O\u2019Donnell, a retired math teacher in Piscataway, N.J., was one of those who tried the combination therapy, but ultimately responded only to Imlygic.

Three years ago, however, he noticed a small raised area on one of them.\n\nSurgeons removed the melanoma, but it returned last year under his arm and in his lung. O\u2019Donnell, who is 67, started the combination therapy shortly thereafter, then stopped taking Yervoy after developing severe diarrhea, a common side effect of the treatment.\n\nBut he kept with the Imlygic, and the lung tumors soon disappeared.

But scientists anticipate that some day a simple pill could help prevent the digestive upsets caused by ingesting the gluten in wheat, rye or barley products.\n\nThe only current treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet. A new study, however, offers some potential for hope. Researchers have re-engineered a naturally occurring enzyme, kumamolisin-As, to break down gluten in the stomach into much smaller protein pieces, called peptides. They say these are less likely to trigger the autoimmune response that can create a wide range of painful and irritating symptoms.\n\nThe re-engineered enzyme, named KumaMax, appears to be highly effective, at least in a test tube. It dismantled more than 95 percent of a gluten peptide that is thought to cause celiac disease, according to the study, which was published recently in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.\n\nIdeally, the team could develop the enzyme into a food additive such as the gas remedies Beano or Gas-X and offer it without a prescription, said lead study author Justin Siegel, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of California, Davis. But this could take a few years to develop. If the researchers opt to make a prescription drug, the process of clinical trials and obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval could take a decade or more, he said.\n\nAn enzyme is a protein that performs a chemical reaction. Proteins are the workhorses in every cell of every living thing, and their function is defined by their shape and structure.\n\nIn this case, the researchers re-engineered the natural enzyme to recognize the peptide that triggers celiac disease and modified the protein in the laboratory so it would survive the acidic stomach environment. \"We did the engineering to change the genes and sent that into standard microorganisms to create the protein,\" Siegel said.\n\nThe next step is to show that the enzyme is not toxic and functions as designed in animals. \"It shouldn't be toxic; it's just a protein you're eating,\" Siegel said.\n\nHow effective might the enzyme be? \"For some people, even flour in the air makes them stop breathing. Some are very sensitive, and in some it just upsets their stomach a little,\" Siegel said. \"For those who are hypersensitive, this probably is not going to solve the problem, but it would allow them to go to dinner, and in case any gluten ended up in their meal, they wouldn't have to worry about it.\"\n\n\"For those less sensitive, they could pop one before each meal and eat anything they want,\" he added.\n\nThe process of identifying the precise trigger for a disease or condition and engineering a drug to circumvent the disease-causing process is part of what some call the personalized medicine revolution, Siegel said. \"We can design a small molecule, a pill, that can be specific to an exact target and have few side effects, if any,\" he said.\n\nSome experts identified limitations to the research.\n\n\"This is the earliest phase, and you now have to show that it actually breaks down the gluten peptides that trigger a response in the stomach at a speed that will protect the human,\" said Dr. Joseph Murray, a professor of medicine in the division of gastroenterology and the department of immunology at the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minn. \"Let's see how it goes with a whole slice of bread.\"\n\nMurray said that dismantling 95 percent of the protein component that is thought to trigger celiac disease may still not be enough to provide celiac patients protection. \"It will probably be helpful to someone who gets a low-level exposure [to glutens] by accident,\" he said.\n\nBut celiac disease is a common problem, with about 2 million to 3 million Americans suffering from it. \"People need alternatives, and this is an example of the scientific community taking novel approaches to helping people with celiac disease,\" Murray said.\n\nLearn more about celiac disease from the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story makes it clear that this is an experimental treatment and not available to the public, although we\u2019re a little uncomfortable with the prediction that a pill could\u00a0be available \u201cin a few years.\u201d That\u2019s true, but it\u2019s also possible that such a pill might\u00a0never be available.

But, researchers believe it may interact with a brain receptor that plays a role in the development of seizures, Devinsky said.\n\n\"This receptor has several effects, but one of them may be to modulate the calcium inside and outside the neuron, which is very much related to the excitability of nerve cells,\" he explained.\n\nPrevious studies have shown some benefit in adults, and word has spread. Families with adults and children with epilepsy have flocked to states where medical marijuana is legal to seek treatment, Brooks-Kayal said.\n\n\"There is a fairly active and vocal group of families in Colorado who are using cannabidiol oils that are made artisanally,\" she said.\n\nTo see whether children with epilepsy would benefit from cannabidiol treatment, Devinsky led a study involving 261 people, mostly children, whose seizures had not been controlled using current anti-seizure medications. The average age of the participants was 11.\n\nEveryone received a British-made cannabidiol oil called Epidiolex, which was administered as a drop on the tongue, Devinsky said.

Normally used for contraception, the intrauterine system is sold under the brand name Mirena.\n\n\"If women suffer with heavy periods and do not want to get pregnant -- as the levonorgestrel intrauterine system is a contraceptive -- then having the levonorgestrel intrauterine system is a very good first-line treatment option that does not require taking regular, daily oral medications,\" said the study's lead author, Dr. Janesh Gupta, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Birmingham and Birmingham Women's Hospital in England.\n\nFor women who do want to get pregnant, Gupta said, taking the blood-clotting drug tranexamic acid during periods is an alternate method of treating heavy periods.\n\nResults of the study, which was funded by the United Kingdom's National Institute of Health Research, appear in the Jan. 10 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nHeavy menstrual bleeding is a significant problem for many women. About 20 percent of gynecologist office visits in the United States and the United Kingdom are because of heavy bleeding. There are several nonhormonal and hormonal treatment options available to reduce blood loss.\n\nThe current study compared the use of traditional medical options -- tranexamic acid pills, mefenamic acid (Ponstel), combined estrogen-progestogen and progesterone alone -- to the use of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system.\n\nThe researchers randomly assigned nearly 600 women with heavy menstrual bleeding to receive either the IUD or standard medical care. They assessed improvement using a patient-reported score on a scale designed to measure severity of symptoms. The scale goes from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating more severe symptoms. The researchers also asked about quality of life and sexual activity, and noted whether a woman needed surgery for heavy periods.\n\nWomen in the IUD group reported much greater improvement -- 32.7 points on the symptom scale versus 21.4 points in the standard treatment group. They also reported greater improvements in quality of life.\n\nThere was no difference in the rates of surgery or sexual activity between the two groups.\n\nMore women were still using the intrauterine system after two years than were still taking standard medical treatments -- 64 percent compared to 38 percent.\n\nGupta said the main reason she believes the IUD group was more successful at reducing symptoms is that there is \"100 percent compliance with treatment as there is a continuous drug treatment effect.\" Women taking medications may forget to take them sometimes.\n\nSerious side effects were similar between the groups. Gupta said the main side effect from the intrauterine system is irregular periods for up to six months.\n\nAnother expert said the findings show promise for women bothered by heavy bleeding.\n\n\"This study really adds to the evidence that shows how useful this intrauterine system is for heavy menstrual bleeding,\" said Dr. Eve Espey, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine in Albuquerque.\n\nGetting an intrauterine system generally just requires one office visit, Espey said. Insertion of the device may be mildly uncomfortable for some women, she said.\n\nFor women who may be hesitant to use an IUD because of pelvic infections linked to an early version called the Dalkon Shield, Gupta said that as long as women are screened for sexually transmitted diseases before getting an intrauterine system, the risk of infection is low.\n\nEspey agreed. \"Today's intrauterine systems have a great side-effect profile,\" she said. \"They also have a high continuation and a high satisfaction rate.\"\n\nLearn more about intrauterine devices from the Association of Reproductive Healthcare Professionals.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "We are only told that the IUD is \u201csold under the brand name Mirena.\u201d\nWe\u2019ll give the story the benefit of the doubt, although it didn\u2019t discuss anything about how widespread is the use of this IUD.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "He contended that kratom does not act on the brain's opioid receptors the way prescription painkillers and heroin do.

Everyone from pro athletes to stroke survivors are benefitting from aquatic exercise that combines walking or running against the natural resistance of the water to help build strength and endurance.\n\nRunning and walking in water is an excellent form of physical therapy for people rehabilitating from hip, knee and back injuries and surgeries. It\u2019s also an easy-on-the joints form of exercise for seniors and others who suffer from arthritis, and a recent study shows it can speed recovery from stroke faster than using a traditional treadmill.\n\nIt\u2019s just an all-around good aerobic conditioner for athletes, too, sports medicine expert Dr. Naresh Rao, told CBS News. Rao is the Olympic Team USA Water Polo Physician for the 2016 Summer Games.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been using hydrotherapy to help decrease any sort of gravity that can affect joint function,\u201d said Rao, who is also with the department of family medicine at Plainview Hospital in Plainview, New York. \u201cI personally prescribe it for knee issues and low back issues.\u201d\n\nHydrotherapy uses a water-friendly treadmill that can be placed in a pool. Another method involves a specially designed treadmill tank.\n\nMatt Johnson, a physical therapist at St. Luke\u2019s Hospital in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, told CBS News that the tank is basically a freestanding tub, about six feet long by three feet wide, with a motorized belt. The water height can be adjusted to the patient\u2019s abilities. The buoyancy of the water helps someone who\u2019s been injured to walk and run a little sooner than they\u2019d be able to do on dry ground, he explained.\n\n\u201cIn water, we can teach them sooner. They can really work on their gait, walk without pain, do exercises in water that you wouldn\u2019t be able to do on land,\u201d said Johnson.\n\nHe uses a HydroTrack Underwater Treadmill System \u2013 professional sports teams including the New York Yankees and the Miami Dolphins, have used it, too. The nice thing about it, said Johnson, is that people can step right into the tank at ground level and then the water fills up around them. It works like a lock on a canal, he said. So, even older patients with limited mobility and balance don\u2019t have to negotiate getting down into a pool.\n\nJohnson starts off recuperating athletes and patients in water somewhere between waist and chest height. The treadmill speed can be set anywhere from 0.3 to 7.1 miles per hour depending on how much resistance a person can handle.\n\n\u201cAt waist height, it\u2019s at about 50 percent of body weight. At chest height, it\u2019s about 30 percent of body weight,\u201d Johnson said, noting, for example, that a person with an injured knee who weighs 100 pounds who is running in waist-high water would only feel like 50 pounds on the bad knee.\n\n\u201cTaking some of that pressure off the knee helps them tolerate that knee injury longer,\u201d said Johnson.\n\nA recent study in the American Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation showed that water workouts might benefit stroke survivors. Researchers asked 21 patients who\u2019d had a stroke within the past two months to undergo two treadmill exercise tests \u2013 one submerged in water and one on a regular treadmill. They gradually increased walking speed and slope over time until the patients couldn\u2019t go any further. Walking on the underwater treadmill produced better measures when it came to maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), a reflection of heart and lung function during exercise, and metabolic equivalents, a measure of energy use.\n\n\u201cThe study proposes a different, very innovative approach\u201d to rehabilitation after stroke, said Dr. Gisele Wolf-Klein, director of geriatric education at Northwell Health in Great Neck, New York.\n\nWolfe-Klein told CBS News she has tried water workouts and said you don\u2019t even feel like you break a sweat even if your heart rate is up. \u201cIt\u2019s a very pleasant way of achieving exactly what you\u2019re trying to do \u2013 allowing a cardio-respiratory response,\u201d Wolfe-Klein told CBS News.\n\nShe noted that medicine\u2019s veterinary counterparts have been using water therapy for years with injured racehorses.\n\nBudd Coates, training director at Runner\u2019s World magazine, said runners don\u2019t just plunge into water\u200b therapy when they\u2019re injured; it\u2019s a great conditioning method for healthy athletes, too.

Some pools may loan them out, too.\n\nOr, Coates suggested, just try it freeform with waist- or chest-high water to start. If you have trouble getting in out of a recreational pool, look for one that has a slanting beach-style entry into the water, or one with a robotic chair lift. Ask a pool lifeguard or certified swim instructor to help you.\n\nIf running\u2019s not your thing, but the water looks inviting, Coates said there are also spin bikes that can be used underwater.\n\nCoates said the beauty of water running (or even walking) is that it\u2019s great for any age and any level of ability, from elderly stroke survivors to Olympic athletes.\n\nGalen Rupp, the 2016 Rio Olympics\u200b men\u2019s marathon bronze medalist, relies on it as part of his training.\n\n\u201cHe and some of the other guys on the Nike team, it\u2019s well known they take advantage of the anti-gravity treadmill and the aqua track,\u201d Coates said.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "It\u2019s not clear from the story how widely available underwater treadmills are for the general public.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "WASHINGTON -- Consuming soy foods (such as soy milk, tofu and edamame) and cruciferous vegetables (such as cabbages, kale, collard greens, bok choy, Brussels sprouts, and broccoli) may be associated with a reduction in common side effects of breast cancer treatment in breast cancer survivors, say a team of scientists led by Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nIn the study, published in Breast Cancer Research and Treatment, higher intake of cruciferous vegetables and soy foods were associated with fewer reports of menopausal symptoms. Higher soy intake was also associated with less reported fatigue. The breast cancer survivors studied included 173 non-Hispanic white and 192 Chinese Americans including US-born Chinese and Chinese immigrants.\n\nResearchers say breast cancer survivors often experience side effects from cancer treatments that can persist months or years after completion of treatment. For example, because many treatments designed to prevent breast cancer recurrence inhibit the body's production or use of estrogen, the hormone that can fuel breast cancer growth, breast cancer patients often experience hot flashes and night sweats, among other side effects.\n\nThe lead author on the study, Sarah Oppeneer Nomura, PhD, of Georgetown Lombardi, said that while further research is needed in larger study populations and with more detailed dietary data, this project addresses an important gap in research on the possible role of lifestyle factors, such as dietary habits, in relation to side effects of treatments.\n\n\"These symptoms can adversely impact survivors' quality of life and can lead them to stopping ongoing treatments, she says. \"Understanding the role of life style factors is important because diet can serve as a modifiable target for possibly reducing symptoms among breast cancer survivors.\"\n\nWhen study participants were evaluated separately by race/ethnicity, associations were significant among white breast cancer survivors; however; while a trend was seen in the benefit for Chinese women, results were not statically significant. Researchers explain Chinese women typically report fewer menopausal symptoms. Most of them also consume cruciferous vegetables and soy foods, making it difficult to see a significant effect in this subgroup. Indeed, in this study, Chinese breast cancer survivors ate more than twice as much soy and cruciferous vegetables.\n\nWhether the reduction in symptoms accounts for longtime use of soy and cruciferous vegetables needs further investigation, says the study's senior author, Judy Huei-yu Wang, PhD, of Georgetown Lombardi's Cancer Prevention and Control Program.\n\nResults obtained in preclinical studies in animals show that biologically active compounds present in both soy and cruciferous vegetables cause breast cancer cells to grow, but have opposite effects in animals that consume these compounds well before cancer is diagnosed and continue consuming them during and after cancer treatments.\n\nUntil more research is conducted, breast cancer patients should not suddenly start eating soy, if they have not consumed it before, says Leena Hilakivi-Clarke, PhD, a professor of oncology at Georgetown Lombardi and a co-author of the study.\n\nResearchers also found suggestive associations with lower reporting of other symptoms, including joint problems, hair thinning/loss and memory less in women who consumed more soy foods, but these associations did not reach statistical significance.\n\nPhytochemicals, or bioactive food components, such as isoflavones in soy foods and glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables may be the source of the benefit, researchers say. Isoflavones bind to estrogen receptors and exert weak estrogenic effects, among other effects. Glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables influence levels of metabolizing enzymes that can modulate inflammation and levels of estrogen, possibly attenuating treatment-related symptoms.\n\nCo-authors of the study include Chiranjeev Dash, MBBS, MPH, PhD, Leena Hilakivi-Clarke, PhD, and Yun-Ling Zhen, MPH, PhD, from Georgetown Lombardi; Yi-Tin Hwang, PhD, from National Taipei University, Taiwan; Scarlett Lin Gomez, MPH, PhD, from the Cancer Prevention Institute of California; Teresa T.

The FDA said the drug, called Januvia, is ``important\" because 70 percent of diabetes patients cannot adequately control their blood sugar using existing treatments. Januvia is expected to become a billion-dollar blockbuster treatment for its maker, & Co., and will be priced at $4.86 per tablet. Newly diagnosed patients can use the drug on its own, along with diet and exercise, to control blood sugar levels. And because it doesn't cause severe side effects when used in combination with popular diabetes drugs already on the market, Januvia also can be used by those whose disease is more advanced and requires more medicines. The drug leverages the body's natural ability to control blood sugar by producing more insulin and lowering glucose. Controlling blood sugar can help stave off the need for patients to take insulin. Diabetes affects about 21 million Americans and occurs when the body builds resistance to insulin needed to break down food, causing blood sugar levels to spike. About 95 percent of adults with diabetes have the Type 2 form. They either do not produce enough insulin or their bodies fail to use what is produced. Those with Type 1 diabetes must take insulin daily because their bodies do not produce any insulin. Unchecked diabetes can cause blindness , kidney failure , and heart ailments and can lead to amputations . The number of people with it is rising because of expanding waistlines and sedentary lifestyles, according to the National Institutes of Health. In clinical trials, Januvia did not have the side effects typical of older treatments, such as weight gain, and dangerous drops in blood sugar. The most commonly reported side effects in trials have been minor: runny noses, coughs, colds, sore throats, diarrhea and nausea. But some in the medical community fear that could change when millions begin to use the new drug. Analysts and physicians said Januvia offers a ``modest\" reduction in a key measurement to gauge how well a patient's blood sugar level is being controlled. Elevated values increase the risk for eye , kidney , nerve, and heart damage. A Boston man with Type 2 diabetes who has responded well to metformin, a generic treatment for diabetes, said he would use Januvia even if it only slightly improved his blood sugar value. ``I look at it as almost like a scale,\" said Marc Onigman , 56 . ``If the drug can help me keep that number dead-even, bring on the drug. As long as it doesn't have side effects that lay me out for a week.\" Januvia boosts insulin levels when blood sugar levels are high, but cuts off the supply ``when the blood sugar goes down to normal,\" said Dr. Edward Horton , director of clinical research at the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston . ``It's taking advantage of the body's own mechanism to respond to a meal.\" Because Januvia helps the body better manage insulin levels, he said, it is much less likely to cause hypoglycemia -- dangerously low blood sugar levels -- than older treatments. Horton, a Harvard Medical School professor of medicine , is a paid Merck consultant. The company has made him available for interviews about Januvia and has sponsored diabetes treatment sessions for doctors featuring him as a speaker. Januvia targets an enzyme that is involved in activating many of the body's hormones, which worries some doctors because studies of how it affects patients have been limited. FDA approval was based on studies involving 2,719 patients. Roughly 440 of them had taken Januvia longer than one year and only 160 had taken the drug for two years. ``The concern always has been that the regulation of some of those hormones may be very important in subsets of patients that we don't yet understand,\" said Dr. John Buse , director of the Diabetes Care Center at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill and president-elect of the American Diabetes Association . Because Januvia is the first drug approved in its class, it is not surprising that some people will approach it with caution, Buse said. ``There are many patients and, maybe, even more doctors who are relatively reluctant to use a new drug in the first six months or year after it's released,\" he said. Merck said it will conduct additional tests of Januvia in combination with insulin and another class of diabetes drugs. ``Type 2 diabetics use a variety of medications to control their condition,\" said Dr. Mary Parks , the director of the FDA's division of metabolism and endocrine products . ``We want as much information\" on the effectiveness and safety of Januvia taken in combination with other products, Parks said. Some 400 different treatments for diabetes are in development. Recent innovations include inhaled insulin, which eliminates the need for injections. research analyst Barbara Ryan , in a note to investors, called diabetes treatments ``hot, hot, hot\" with a market size capable of supporting ``multiple new blockbuster opportunities.\" AG is hot on the heels of Januvia with its own new-generation diabetes pill, Galvus , expected to receive FDA approval next month . By shipping Januvia quickly, Merck aims to take advantage of ``a short window before Galvus gets the green light,\" analyst Jami Rubin wrote in a research note. Rubin forecasts $350 million in Januvia sales worldwide in 2007 with $1.6 billion in sales by 2010 , a conservative estimate. A Reuters survey of 60 physicians found ``the vast majority\" intend to prescribe Januvia and Galvus immediately.

Patients took lorcaserin twice a day for a year and also took part in diet and exercise counseling.\n\nAfter one year, 47.5 percent of those taking lorcaserin had lost 5 percent or more of their body weight. \"That's about 20 pounds,\" Smith said.\n\nAmong those taking the placebo, only 20.3 percent had achieved that amount of weight loss, the researchers found.\n\nAfter the first year, people taking lorcaserin were randomized to lorcaserin or placebo for an additional year. Among people who stayed on lorcaserin, 67.9 percent were able to maintain the weight loss they had seen in the first year. Among those who were switched to a placebo, 50.3 percent were able to maintain their weight loss, Smith's group reported.\n\nSmith's team noted that for those taking lorcaserin, there was no increase in heart valve problems as had been seen with the discredited diet drug Fen-Phen. However, common side effects included headache, dizziness and nausea.\n\nDr. Arne Astrup, from the department of human nutrition at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark and author of an accompanying journal editorial, said that \"the trial on lorcaserin provides evidence of a safe weight-loss medication, that seems to provide benefits in terms of reducing risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\"\n\nAlso, it does not have the same problems as the previous weight-loss drugs, Fen-Phen (Phentermine), Acomplia (rimonabant) or Meridia (sibutramine), which had been associated with heart problems, he said.\n\n\"If weight-loss drugs are tailor-made to hit only the right receptor, based on physiological knowledge, it seems to be possible to develop weight-loss medications that do not possess any serious adverse effects,\" Astrup added.\n\nHowever, one expert was not sold on this new drug.\n\n\"What's most impressive about this two-year clinical trial is how unimpressive it is,\" said Dr. David L.

Premature birth can lead to a long list of medical problems and puts babies at risk of dying.\n\nIn the new study, the researchers examined blood samples from 80 women who went on to have normal births and 80 who had premature births. They tried to find signs in the blood that indicate what kind of birth the women would have.\n\nThe researchers developed a screening method that looked for so-called peptide biomarkers in the blood that -- in tandem with several other proteins -- predicted 80 percent to 90 percent of the premature births at 28 weeks of gestation. The false positive rate -- referring to tests that wrongly indicated premature birth -- was 20 percent.\n\nThe test wasn't as effective at 24 weeks of gestation.\n\n\"This may simply indicate that some of the causes for preterm birth may not pre-exist before the pregnancy,\" Graves said. \"Most probably don't, but develop or become apparent as the pregnancy progresses.

They found that electrodes designed with no wire (called lateral wall electrodes) performed the best in maintaining residual hearing in the inner ear, compared to electrodes made with wire. More specifically, the non-wire electrodes were less traumatic, causing less injury and minimizing fractures inside the inner ear. The study found that the actual brand of the electrode did not make a difference; the presence or absence of wire was the only distinguishing factor.\n\nDr. Wanna and the researchers also looked at the impact of two major surgical approaches used to insert the electrodes in the inner ear: \"round window\" (where surgeons open the membrane without bone removal or drilling in the inner ear) and \"cochleostomy\" (which requires drilling into the bone to get inside the inner ear).

Karow, MD, PhD, assistant professor of radiology at UC San Diego and the study\u2019s corresponding author. \u201cDoctors at UC San Diego and UCLA now have a non-invasive imaging method to more accurately assess the local extent of the tumor and possibly predict the grade of the tumor, which can help them more precisely and effectively determine appropriate treatment.\u201d\n\nThe current standard of care for detecting and diagnosing prostate cancer is contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which involves intravenously injecting patients with a contrast agent to highlight blood flow. Greater blood flow is often a requirement of growing cancer cells. When compared to surrounding healthy tissues, it\u2019s hoped that contrast enhanced MRIs will reveal the shape and nature of any tumors present.\n\nBut many tumors do not significantly differ from surrounding healthy tissues with contrast enhanced MRI and so evade easy detection. An imaging technique called diffusion MRI measures the diffusion of water and has been a standard imaging technique in the brain and an emerging technique in the prostate. Cancer tissues are denser than healthy tissues and typically limit the amount and mobility of water within them. But diffusion MRI suffers from magnetic field artifacts that can distort the actual location of tumors by as much as 1.2 centimeters or roughly half an inch \u2013 a significant distance when surgeons are attempting, for example, to assess whether a tumor extends beyond the prostate and into adjacent nerve bundles.\n\nThe new approach described in today\u2019s published paper is called restriction spectrum imaging-MRI or RSI-MRI. It corrects for magnetic field distortions and focuses upon water diffusion within tumor cells. By doing both, the ability of imaging to accurately plot a tumor\u2019s location is increased and there is a more refined sense of the tumor\u2019s extent, said Nathan White, PhD, assistant project scientist at UC San Diego, study co-author and co-inventor of the RSI-MRI technique.\n\nIn a related paper to be published in the journal Frontiers in Oncology, the same team of researchers reported that RSI-MRI appears to predict tumor grade.

Data from the scientific literature suggest a rise in mortality from POCD in the first year after surgery under general anesthesia.\n\nThe good news, according to a Brazilian study published by the journal PLoS One, is that two relatively simple measures can help to reduce the incidence of POCD: administering a small dose of the anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone immediately before an operation and avoiding profound anesthesia during the operation.\n\nOpinions on the adequate depth of anesthesia and the risks of very profound anesthesia currently diverge. Excessively superficial anesthesia is known to incur a risk of patient recall of the procedure, which is undesirable.\n\n\"Our findings confirm recent evidence that the deeper the anesthesia-induced hypnosis, the higher the incidence of POCD.

Patients who failed to achieve a cutoff score were excluded. The remaining subjects were divided randomly into four groups. In the operating room, deep anesthesia typical of major surgical procedures was induced in the first and third groups, and more superficial anesthesia in the second and fourth. Only the third and fourth groups received dexamethasone.\n\nThe depth of anesthesia was monitored using bispectral index (BIS) technology, which processes electroencephalogram signals to measure drug-induced unconsciousness.

Patients who saw the most improvements had more severe disease at the time of surgery and were of an older age at diagnosis.\n\n\"This study highlights the collaborative spirit of academic medicine, and how our rheumatology and bariatric surgery researchers worked together to not only help our patients directly, but inform the medical community at large,\" says study co-author Jose U. Scher, MD, assistant professor of rheumatology and co-director of the NYU Langone's Psoriatic Arthritis Center. \"These findings can be used to identify people who may benefit most from this type of intervention.\"\n\nThe NYU Langone researchers next plan to conduct larger studies to further define their findings and the effects of excess weight loss and bariatric surgery on psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis disease activity.\n\nPsoriasis is a condition that affects 7.5 million Americans, according to the National Psoriasis Foundation. It is estimated that as many as 20 percent of individuals with moderate to severe psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis in their lifetime. Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune-related skin condition in which thick, scaly patches appear on the skin. Psoriatic arthritis is similar in presentation -- but also can lead to joint pain.\n\nTreatment requires a coordinated effort by dermatologists and rheumatologists to help manage symptoms such as swelling, inflammation and skin changes.\n\nPoster Presentation Number 688: Clinical Improvements in Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis with Surgical Weight Loss", "question": "Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Bariatric surgery is widely available and most people with internet access (or any access to medical care) can figure that out fairly quickly in their area.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Patients gave universally positive feedback about the app's ease of use and the ability to have wounds monitored\n\nCHICAGO (Jan. 19, 2018): A new smartphone app called WoundCare is successfully enabling patients to remotely send images of their surgical wounds for monitoring by nurses. The app was developed by researches from the Wisconsin Institute of Surgical Outcomes Research (WiSOR), Department of Surgery, University of Wisconsin, Madison, with the goal of earlier detection of surgical site infections (SSIs) and prevention of hospital readmissions. The study results appear as an \"article in press\" on the website of the Journal of the American College of Surgeons ahead of print.\n\nSSIs are the most common hospital-acquired infection and the leading cause of hospital readmission following an operation.1,2,3 Due to the prevalence off SSIs, the WiSOR research team decided to see if postoperative wound monitoring could be effectively achieved by having patients upload photos through the WoundCare app and answer a few brief questions to gather information not easily captured through images.\n\n\"Patients cannot identify [infections] and frequently ignore or fail to recognize the early signs of cellulitis or other wound complications,\" study authors wrote. \"This drawback leads to the common and frustrating scenario where patients present to a routine, scheduled clinic appointment with an advanced wound complication that requires readmission, with or without reoperation. However, the complication may have been amenable to outpatient management if detected earlier.\"\n\nForty vascular surgery patients were enrolled in the study. There was an overall data submission rate of 90.2 percent among participants, and submissions were reviewed within an average of 9.7 hours. During the study, seven wound complications were detected and one false negative was found.\n\n\"We set out to come up with a protocol where patients could become active participants in their care and allow us to be in closer communication and monitor their wounds after they leave the hospital,\" said lead study author and general surgery resident Rebecca L. Gunter, MD. . \"This approach allows us to intervene at an earlier time rather than waiting for patients to come back in after the problem has already developed past the point of being able to manage it on an outpatient basis.\"\n\nPatients were enthusiastic about the app's ease of use and the reassurance they felt having their wounds regularly monitored. The nurse practitioners responsible for reviewing the submitted images attested to the value of the photos and patient satisfaction, although they also noted it was difficult to find time to review the submitted images on top of an already heavy clinical workload. Study authors note that the success and sustainability of a post-discharge wound-monitoring protocol requires a dedicated transitional care program and not simply adding a task to the current staff workload.\n\nThis protocol also has a cost-savings component, in addition to the patient safety and satisfaction aspects. Study authors note that SSIs are the most expensive hospital-acquired infection, costing an average of nearly $30,000 per wound-related readmission and an estimated $3-10 billion annually.\n\n\"If you could imagine saving the cost from the number of patients whose readmission you were able to prevent, that result could provide significant savings to the health system,\" Dr. Gunter said. Although capturing specific numbers related to cost-savings was not part of this study, Dr. Gunter said it is an important area of focus for future studies.\n\nA limitation to telemedicine protocols that call for the use of smartphones is that not every patient has the necessary technology or knowledge to upload images on their own. The WiSOR research team addressed this issue by having participants undergo tailored training to learn to use the WoundCheck app. They provided each patient with an iPhone 5S and an accompanying visual reference guide to further assist in using the phone and app. Dr. Gunter said they were very successful in giving patients knowledge and access to technology so they could participate in the study. She said this is a model easily adaptable to other medical centers, whether through providing participants with a phone, having a rotating supply of phones at the hospitals for patients to borrow, or relying on a patient's personal device.\n\n\"We have demonstrated that a population of complex and high-risk patients, many of whom are older adults and novice smartphone users, can complete this protocol with high fidelity and satisfaction,\" the researchers concluded.\n\nStudy coauthors from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, include Sara Fernandes-Taylor, PhD, Shahrose Rahman, BS, Lola Awoyinka, MPH, Kyla M.

There\u2019s no such thing as a blood test, cheek swab or other accepted biological marker so specialists must depend on parent and teacher reports, observations and play assessments. Figuring out a child's trajectory once he or she is diagnosed is just as challenging. The spectrum is wide and some are destined to be on the mild end and be very talkative, sometimes almost indistinguishable from those without the disorder in some settings, while others will suffer from a more severe form and have trouble being able to speak basic words.\n\nNow scientists believe that they have a way to distinguish between those paths, at least in terms of language ability, in the toddler years using brain imaging.\n\nIn an article published Thursday in the journal Neuron, scientists at the University of California-San Diego have found that children with autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, with good language outcomes have strikingly distinct patterns of brain activation as compared to those with poor language outcomes and typically developing toddlers.\n\n\"Why some toddlers with ASD get better and develop good language and others do not has been a mystery that is of the utmost importance to solve,\" Eric Courchesne, one of the study\u2019s authors and co-director of the University of California-San Diego's Autism Center, said in a statement.\n\nThe images of the children in the study -- MRIs of the brain -- were taken at 12 to 29 months while their language was assessed one to two years later at 30 to 48 months.\n\nSuch research has become critically important as the number of children diagnosed with autism has soared in recent decades to 1 in 68. Scientists have looked at numerous possible causes, from genetics to environmental exposure, but no definitive answers. Autism is considered by most experts to be a lifelong condition, but numerous studies have found that children's outcomes improve with early therapy. Hundreds of millions of dollars of state and federal funding are being spent each year to provide help to children and adults with autism and being able to pinpoint children at risk in the early years could help direct those public resources to where they could do the most good.\n\nBrain imaging has become a popular subject of research in recent years as the technology to be able to scan, store and analyze the terabytes of information in the pictures has become more affordable.

The study included a liquid pharmaceutical formulation of CBD, called Epidiolex, which is manufactured by GW Pharmaceuticals and has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. GW Pharmaceuticals funded the clinical trial.\n\nFor the study, 120 children and adolescents with Dravet Syndrome between the ages of 2 and 18 years were randomized across 23 sites in the United States and Europe to receive either CBD 20 mg/kg or placebo added to their existing treatment over a 14-week period. Seizure frequency was tracked for one month prior to the study for baseline readings, and during the course of the study.\n\nSpecifically, seizure frequency dropped in the CBD-treated group by 39 percent from a median of nearly 12 convulsive seizures per month before the study to about six; three patients' seizures stopped entirely. In the placebo group, there was a 13 percent reduction in seizures from about 15 monthly seizures to fourteen. The difference in the degree of seizure reduction between the CBD group and the placebo group was both statistically significant and clinically consistent.\n\nSide effects \u2013 experienced by 93.4 percent of patients in the CBD group and 74.6 percent of those treated with placebo \u2013 were generally reported as mild or moderate in severity. The most common side effects in the CBD group were vomiting, fatigue and fever. Eight participants from the CBD group withdrew from the trial due to side effects compared to one participant in the placebo group.\n\nThe new study confirms results from a December 2015 open-label expanded access program led by Dr. Devinsky that reported reductions in seizure frequency. In that program, both the researchers and patient's families knew they were receiving CBD, which may have introduced a bias into the results. This new, randomized, controlled clinical study eliminated those concerns as participants and their physicians did not know if they were on CBD or placebo, say the study authors.\n\nFuture research will look at whether safety and tolerability might be improved and whether efficacy of CBD can be maintained at lower doses.

Park-Wyllie, of St. Michael\u2019s Hospital in Toronto, who worked on the new study.\n\n\u201cWomen with osteoporosis who are at high risk of fractures should not stop taking their treatment,\u201d she told Reuters Health.\n\nSome 10 million Americans currently suffer from bone thinning, according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation. The majority are postmenopausal women.\n\nPark-Wyllie and colleagues tapped into data on more than 205,000 Ontario women at least 68 years old who had taken the bone drugs. Their findings appear in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nOverall, 716 women suffered the unusual type of thighbone fracture after starting the bone drugs, and nearly 10,000 had typical hip fractures.\n\nThe risk of a thighbone fracture differed depending on how long the women had been taking the medicine. After taking bone drugs for five years, about one in 1,000 women went on to suffer a thigh fracture over the next year.\n\nThat works out to nearly three times the risk of those who\u2019d taken the drugs for roughly three months or less, after accounting for other risk factors.\n\nOn the other hand, longer treatment was tied to a 24-percent decrease in hip fractures, which along with wrist and spine fractures affect about half of all people with osteoporosis.\n\nThere are several alternative ways to treat osteoporosis, including hormone treatment for women. And one preliminary study, published along with the Canadian findings in JAMA, hints that the common heart medication nitroglycerin might also boost bone health.\n\nSo far, however, the cheap and effective bisphosphonate bone drugs remain the most popular treatment option. But some experts worry that negative media coverage might have led to more fractures and possibly deaths by dissuading patients from taking the drugs.\n\n\u201cThe bad news is that overstating the levels of risk of side effects with these drugs \u2014 which the media have been doing for some time now \u2014 has led people to stop the drugs when they should be taking them,\u201d said Dr. Ethel S.

She had a second mammogram. Nothing there, the radiologist assured her. \"Then one night, I found the 'nothing there' had grown bigger,\" Litt said. Her self-exam had proved accurate. Two years ago, Litt underwent a double mastectomy and months of chemotherapy to survive an aggressive breast cancer. It defies common sense, she says, for scientists to conclude that breast self-exams do women more harm than good. \"It's a very important tool,\" the 67-year-old Portland woman says. \"Why throw away an important tool?\" A scientific review, published in August by the\n\n, highlighted the downside of doing breast self-exams: Women taught to perform the monthly ritual wind up having unnecessary biopsies. They are about twice as likely to undergo biopsies that won't find cancerous tumors, according to two studies tracking hundreds of thousands of women in China and Russia. Conflicting news coverage has heightened the confusion. \"Breast self-exam has no benefit,\" one headline proclaimed. \"Breast self-exam key in catching what mammogram may miss,\" another said. What is clear is that studies don't supply an answer that fits all women.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Steiner, director of the breast health education program at\n\n, said each woman must decide for herself, with full knowledge of the pros and cons, whether to perform self-exams. And there's not a right or wrong answer. Some may do the exams and accept the risk of unnecessary biopsies, she said. Others may decide that either they can't commit the time to do them right, or that the potential for false alarms and anxiety isn't worth it. \"That's a very personal decision,\" Steiner said.\n\nWhen doctors began promoting breast self-exams in the 1950s, the benefits seemed obvious. Here was a simple, inexpensive do-it-yourself way for women to find tumors before it was too late. During the women's health movement of the 1970s, the self-exam gained importance as a means for women to take charge and rely less on a paternalistic health system. But researchers have learned that self-exams aren't at all simple. The technique is complicated and difficult to learn to do well. Guidelines on how to do them correctly have evolved, leaving many women and doctors with outdated ideas. Further, decades of research still have not produced good evidence that self-exams make any difference in breast cancer survival. \"Not only do the trials not find a benefit, the trials demonstrate harm in terms of increased physician visits and benign breast biopsies,\" said Dr. Nancy Baxter, a University of Toronto surgeon who reviewed the evidence on self-exams for the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. She said self-exams may not reveal tumors early enough to improve survival. \"By the time a breast cancer is large enough to be detected by self-exam, tumor biology is the most important predictor of outcome, not finding a tumor a few months before it would have become apparent,\" she said. Given the lack of evidence, the\n\nconsiders the exams unproven. And the\n\nhas recommended against routine teaching of breast self-exams since 2001. Unnecessary biopsies may not be the only hidden cost. \"One danger of pushing breast self-exams on patients is that they may be falsely reassured by it and opt out of their mammograms,\" said Dr. Heidi Nelson, medical director of the\n\nin Portland. She stopped routinely teaching self-exams to patients after the large trials in China and Russia showed no benefit.\n\nSome evidence does suggest that self-exams done properly could make a difference. For instance, they provide a means to search for tumors in outer parts of the breast where mammography may not reach. About half of breast cancers develop in the upper-outer quadrant of the breast, which is largely inaccessible to mammography scanners. A small study in Canada in 1997 found that self-exams seemed to improve survival among a subset of women using proper technique. The preferred method, known as the vertical strip, three-pressure test, has proved the most sensitive and least likely to produce false alarms, Steiner said. In the largest and most influential study to date, involving 266,000 women in Shanghai, Steiner said researchers taught an inferior method of exams. She said that could partly explain why the Shanghai study failed to find improved survival. Self-exams also appeal strongly to some younger women, whose main screening test is a manual exam done by a doctor or nurse. Mammography is considered inappropriate for women younger than 40, and many doctors don't recommend it until age 50. If a woman decides to do self-exams, Steiner said, it's important to learn to do them right -- and do them every month without fail. \"Done haphazardly and irregularly, it is probably worse than no breast self-exam at all,\" Steiner said. She encourages women to schedule an appointment devoted to learning the technique, which should take at least a half-hour. A few minutes squeezed into a routine annual exam aren't enough, she said. Steiner said not all doctors are up to speed on breast exam technique, which calls for lying down, not taking a few minutes standing in the shower -- the form pushed for years by physicians and even anti-breast cancer groups. \"It's important to ask, 'Do you feel confident in your own technique and training me how to do it?'\" she said. Nelson cautions women not to skip their mammograms if they don't find lumps during self-exams. But finding a lump also is no reason to panic, given the limited accuracy of the self-test. Litt, the breast cancer survivor, has another piece of advice: \"Do not ignore your own judgment; and be assertive,\" she said. \"You don't get a do-over.\"\n\nWhat to make of breast cancer's \"1-in-8\" statistic.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The availability of breast self-exams (BSE) is implicit; however, the story appropriately notes that not all physicians or health educators know current BSE technique, and there is a suggestion that inappropriate technique may influence the sensitivity of the self-exam.

They included sharing news about friends or relatives or plans for the day as a way to involve their spouse in day-to-day events; waiting patiently and keeping eye contact while spouses searched for words; and finding alternate ways to communicate \u2014 for example, singing songs together when attempts to engage the spouse in certain topics failed.\n\nThe caregiving spouses seemed to value their partners\u2019 efforts to communicate as much as or more than the actual content of their conversations. They were willing to listen to stories they had heard before, and resisted correcting their partners\u2019 versions of past events. This showed that they \u201cvalue the relationship more than being right,\u201d Williams said.\n\nSome of the caregivers did voice frustration or tried to teach their partners information they had forgotten. Future research might focus on interventions that could help diffuse these frustrations, the paper noted. Yet Williams hopes that the more supportive and positive communication patterns that many of the caregivers showed will help nurses coach spouses and family members affected by Alzheimer\u2019s. Previous research has found that communication decline among people with dementia is a significant source of stress to caregivers, and most say they need education about communication.\n\n\u201cThe reality is, a person with dementia isn\u2019t going to have a dramatic breakthrough and remember things forgotten,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAt the same time, people with Alzheimer\u2019s do have moments of clarity or show affection when it\u2019s unexpected. These are moments that caregivers can cherish.\u201d", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The behavioral approaches derived from this study seem to be easily adoptable by caregivers.

And that early screening also means that colorectal cancer can be treated more effectively.\n\nBut all of this hasn't been enough to convince a lot of people make those appointments. Fear of doctors, the prospect of being poked and prodded in strange places, a lack of insurance to cover the costly test -- or a combination of all three -- are to blame for as many as half of the over-50 crowd putting off or avoiding the screening test altogether.\n\nThat's why the American Cancer Society, which estimates there will be about 108,000 new cases of colon cancer and 40,700 new cases of rectal cancer this year, added the stool DNA test to its screening guidelines this spring. It joins six other tests, including the traditional colonoscopy and the new CT colonography, or virtual colonoscopy.\n\nDr. Sanford Markowitz, a cancer genetics expert at the Ireland Cancer Center of University Hospitals Case Medical Center, has helped develop the technology behind the stool DNA test.\n\nFive years ago, Markowitz, who is also on the faculty at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, and his research team discovered a specific DNA change that takes place in colon cancers. They then created techniques for detecting the DNA change when it expelled from the body in feces.\n\nWith the discovery of the gene marker Vimentin comes a new way to significantly increase the rate of detection of colon cancer.\n\nWhile colonoscopy is still viewed as the best screening agent, it's not effective if it's not being used, he said.\n\n\"Clearly by itself, it is not reaching other people,\" said Markowitz, who sits on the medical advisory board of the National Colorectal Cancer Research Alliance. CBS Evening News anchor Katie Couric, whose husband died of the disease, co-founded the group.\n\n\"Our idea was that if you had an inexpensive test that was easy to use and wasn't invasive, you could reach a lot of people and prevent deaths from happening every day of the year,\" Markowitz said.\n\nUnlike a traditional colonoscopy, one doesn't need to go through an extensive bowel cleaning through changes in diet and medication or take time off work.\n\nAll it takes is collecting a stool sample -- use your imagination here -- and sending it off to a lab for testing.\n\nTwo Massachusetts-based companies have a license to develop a practical screening test based on Markowitz's work.\n\nUp until June 1, LabCorp of America had a product on the market. Since 2003, the PreGen-Plus kit could be ordered through a physician or other licensed health care provider for $800, although some insurance and health plans covered the cost partially or in full.\n\nLabCorp has said it will come out with a new test this year.\n\nExact Science Corp. is in discussions with the FDA to develop a test that could hit the over-the-counter market sometime in 2009, pending FDA approval, said company president Jeffrey Luber.\n\nThat test, which looks at two different DNA markers (instead of the one marker used by PreGen-Plus), is the one with which Markowitz is more familiar. It will be geared toward use in the privacy of one's home.\n\nNot since 1998, when the FDA approved the PSA test for early detection of prostate cancer, had new technology been created in early cancer detection until the stool DNA test.\n\nCompared to more invasive procedures, the test still might miss some polyps and cancers and may need to be repeated more often. If results are abnormal, a colonoscopy would still be required.\n\nBut it's a huge step forward, especially for those who are skittish about a trip to the doctor.\n\n\"Right now, we think we can detect about 80 percent of cancers,\" Markowitz said. \"Our goal is to reach 100 percent.\"", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "It\u2019s clear from the story that one stool DNA test has been commercially available since 2003.

The team used this opportunity to see how stimulating the brain affects memory.\n\nThey focused on an area of the brain called the entorhinal cortex, which helps form and store memories.\n\n\u201cThe entorhinal cortex is the golden gate to the brain\u2019s memory mainframe,\u201d Dr. Itzhak Fried, professor of neurosurgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, who worked on the study, said in a telephone interview. The research was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nFried said sensory experiences that eventually become memories pass through this hub before they are stored in the hippocampus, the brain\u2019s chief memory center.\n\nFor the study, patients played a video game in which they had to shuttle people around in taxis to different shops in a virtual city. The team tested whether stimulating the entorhinal cortex or the hippocampus while they were learning their way around the city improved their recall.\n\n\u201cWhen we stimulated the hippocampus itself, there was not an effect. It was really stimulation in the gateway to the hippocampus - the entorhinal cortex - where we got the beneficial effect in terms of memory,\u201d Fried said.\n\nCompared to testing before stimulation, zapping this part of the brain helped people recognize landmarks and navigate the virtual city more quickly. Fried said the findings suggest stimulating the brain just as memories are forming is key.\n\nIn Alzheimer\u2019s disease, this area of the brain is affected early on, when signs of dementia begin to appear.\n\nFried said the study might have implications for treatments for patients with early Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but he cautioned that the results are very preliminary.\n\n\u201cThe question would be whether this can help memory in patients with memory impairments,\u201d he said. Scientists are increasingly focused on ways to treat the memory-robbing disease, which affects more than 5 million Americans.\n\nDespite costly efforts, no drug has been found that can keep Alzheimer\u2019s from progressing, and policymakers are growing increasingly worried about the swelling ranks of dementia patients as the population ages.\n\nSuzanne Haber, a neuroscientist at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York who was not involved in the study, said she was \u201cvery excited about the finding,\u201d but she cautioned that the treatment is very invasive, very expensive and unproven in Alzheimer\u2019s patients.\n\nThe Obama administration said on Wednesday it plans to spend an additional $156 million over the next two years to help find an effective treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nOne team has already tried deep brain stimulation in Alzheimer\u2019s patients. In a study published in the Annals of Neurology in 2010 researchers tested deep brain stimulation in six patients over the course of a year and found the treatment to be relatively safe. They also saw signs the treatment might have an effect on memory.\n\nDr. Sandra Black, a brain researcher at the University of Toronto who wrote an editorial on the current study, said the findings could have implications for early stage Alzheimer\u2019s disease if tests were developed to identify this process early through imaging or genomics.\n\n\u201cAlthough the current evidence is preliminary, is based on small samples and requires replication, the potential application of deep-brain stimulation in amnestic disorders is enticing,\u201d Black wrote.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story describes how brain stimulation is now used to treat some patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease and other disorders, while making clear that more research is needed before anyone will know if it offers any benefits to people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Jan. 6, 2010 -- A new imaging technique that measures the random motion of water within the brain may prove useful for detecting early signs of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThe technique, known as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) or diffusion MRI, is used to assess changes in the white matter regions of the brain.\n\nBut it is increasingly clear that DTI can also be used to identify very small structural changes in the gray matter of the brain, which is critical for learning and memory, researcher Giovanni A.

In women agreeing to participate, this led to a 28 per cent reduction in hip fractures over five years.\n\nProfessor Neil Gittoes, of the University of Birmingham's Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, said: \"Our findings showed that screening led to a statistically significant decrease in hip fractures. \"Our data has the potential to influence national policies around prevention of hip fractures, which is particularly relevant in our ageing society. The consequences of hip fractures to older people can be devastating, including impaired mobility and loss of independence. \"While we have demonstrated clinical effectiveness of screening, we are also exploring cost-effectiveness of this approach; initial analyses also look promising in this respect.\"\n\nProfessor Lee Shepstone, from UEA's Norwich Medical School, said: \"Approximately one in three women and one in five men aged over 50 year will suffer a fragility fracture during their remaining lifetime. In the UK around 536,000 people suffer fragility fractures each year, including 79,000 hip fractures.\n\n\"A hip fracture can be devastating with a loss of independence and less than one third of patients make a full recovery. Mortality at one-year post-fracture is approximately 20 per cent.\"\n\n\"We wanted to find out whether screening, like screening for breast cancer, could help identify those at risk of suffering a fracture.\"\n\nThe team used a University of Sheffield developed tool called FRAX, which predicts the probability of a hip fracture or a major osteoporotic fracture (a hip, spine, upper arm or lower arm fracture), to identify older women at high risk.\n\nA total of 12,483 women aged 70-85 were recruited from 100 GP practices in seven regions -Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester, Norwich, Sheffield, Southampton, and York. Half of the women were screened to compare screening with routine care.\n\nAmong those screened, treatment was subsequently recommended for one in seven women deemed at high risk of hip fracture. This recommendation was acted upon by the women and their GPs so that over three quarters of the women at high risk were on osteoporosis medications within six months of screening.\n\nWhile screening did not reduce the incidence of all osteoporosis-related fractures, there was strong evidence for a reduction in hip fractures.\n\nIn the screening group, there were 54 fewer women who suffered one or more hip fractures compared to the routine care group.\n\nThe study suggests that one hip fracture could be prevented for every 111 women screened and early analysis suggests the approach is likely to be cost-effective.\n\nProfessor Shepstone added: \"This is the first trial to show that a community-screening approach based on the FRAX fracture risk tool is both feasible and effective. Given that the number of costly and debilitating hip fractures are expected to increase with an ageing population, the results of this study potentially have important public health implications.\"\n\nProfessor Eugene McCloskey, of the University of Sheffield, said: \"Low-cost screening with FRAX among the older population could result in effective, targeted intervention to reduce the human and socioeconomic burden of hip fractures.\n\n\"If the SCOOP screening strategy was taken up in exactly the same way as in the study in all UK women aged 70-85 years, we estimate that the strategy could prevent up to 8000 hip fractures per year in the UK. Even greater gains could be made if we could reach out to women similar to those who did not take part in the study.\"\n\nThe randomised controlled trial 'SCreening for Osteoporosis in Older women for the Prevention of fracture' (SCOOP) was funded by the Medical Research Council and Arthritis Research UK.\n\nDr Natalie Carter, head of research liaison and evaluation at Arthritis Research UK, said: \"Ten of thousands of people a year present with hip fractures in the UK.

(Table sugar, or sucrose, extracted from sugar cane or sugar beets, is a compound of glucose and fructose.) Researchers also took blood samples to measure levels of glucose, fructose and insulin, and of leptin and ghrelin, enzymes involved in controlling hunger and feelings of fullness.\n\nBefore having their drinks, the participants rated their desire to eat on a one-to-10 scale from \u201cnot at all\u201d to \u201cvery much.\u201d Then they drank the liquids and had functional magnetic resonance imaging brain scans while looking at images of food and of neutral objects like buildings or baskets. As they did so, they rated their hunger using the scale. The volunteers were then presented with images of high-calorie foods and asked whether they would like to have the food now, or a monetary award a month later instead.\n\nThe study, published in the journal PNAS, found that compared with glucose, consuming fructose produced greater responses to food cues in the orbital frontal cortex of the brain, a region that plays an important role in reward processing. The fructose drink also produced greater activity in the visual cortex when volunteers looked at images of food, a finding that suggests increased craving compared with glucose.\n\nWhen choosing between tasty high-calorie food or a delayed monetary reward, fructose drinkers were more likely than glucose drinkers to choose the food.\n\nThere was no difference in leptin or ghrelin levels between fructose and glucose drinkers. But plasma insulin response was sharply lower in fructose drinkers, which may affect what we eat, according to the senior author, Dr. Kathleen A.

Taking tamoxifen for five years after diagnosis reduces breast cancer mortality by about one-third.\n\nIn the new study, women with early tumors who took tamoxifen for 10 years cut their risk of dying from breast cancer by another 29%, compared to women who stopped after five years.\n\nIn absolute terms, 12% of women on tamoxifen for 10 years died of breast cancer within five to 14 years after diagnosis, compared to 15% of those who stopped at five years.\n\nOverall, women who take tamoxifen for a decade cut their risk of dying from breast cancer nearly in half, compared with those who don't take it at all, says study co-author Richard Gray of the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.\n\nThat's significant, given that tamoxifen is used by hundreds of thousands of women worldwide, says Gray, whose study was presented Wednesday at the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Oxford funded the study, which included more than 6,800 women from 36 countries, While tamoxifen delays tumor growth in some women, it appears to cure others, Gray says.\n\n\"This is a dream come true for women,\" says V.

In India, it's 2 cents a pill, says Jordan, scientific director at Georgetown's Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nJordan says the new findings will quickly change care for some patients.\n\nYounger women with more aggressive tumors may want to extend their tamoxifen use, says Jennifer Litton, an assistant professor at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who wasn't involved in the study.\n\nTamoxifen is the only hormonal option for women before menopause, Litton says.\n\nDoctors may not want to change the care of older patients, however, she says. That's because postmenopausal women have the option of tamoxifen or another class of hormonal therapies, called aromatase inhibitors, or AIs. These drugs are slightly more effective than tamoxifen, although they don't work before menopause, Litton says.\n\nBecause the study didn't include AIs, doctors can't say how whether tamoxifen would benefit women who've taken them, Litton says. Other researchers are conducting trials comparing five versus 10 years of AIs, although these results won't be out for several years.\n\nGray noted that tamoxifen has risks. In his study, doubling the length of treament also doubled the risk of endometrial cancer, which affects the uterine lining, to about 3%. However, because this cancer is very treatable, death rates were low: 0.4% of those on tamoxifen for 10 years died of endometrial cancer, compared to 0.2% of those taking it for five years.\n\nDoctors saw no increase in strokes, which has long been a concern with tamoxifen, Gray says.\n\nBreast cancer survivors have mixed reactions to the results.\n\nSome women will be glad to have another treament option, says breast cancer survivor Lillie Shockney, 59, administrative director of the Johns Hopkins Cancer Survivorhip Program in Baltimore.\n\n\"Patients get very nervous when they stop any hormonal therapy, because they feel like now they aren't doing anything,\" says Shockney, 59. \"The opportunity to 'do something' might be appealing, despite the side effects.\"\n\nShockney says she'd like to see research on other ways to prevent recurrences, such as weight loss. \"If someone lost 40 pounds, would that do as much as another five years on tamoxifen?\" Shockney asks.\n\nSome patients may be reluctant to prolong their use of a drug that causes so many side effects, says Boston breast cancer survivor Alicia Staley.\n\nStudies show that only 80% of women take tamoxifen for five years, Litton says. Some switch to an AI, although these drugs can also cause problems, such as joint pain and osteoporosis.\n\nStaley say she tamoxifen gave her \"many, many side effects,\" including severe hot flashes. \"Dry eyes, joint pain, weight gain \u2014 you name it, I had it,\" she says.\n\nAfter 2\u00bd years, Staley and her doctor stopped the drug \"to regain a measure of quality of life.\"\n\nFor Shockney, tamoxifen took a heavy toll on her marriage, causing dryness that made sex unbearably painful.\n\nPatients and their partners need to have honest talks with doctors about how extended treatment will affect their relationship, she says.\n\n\"If we are going to look at giving women tamoxifen for 10 years, by golly, we better get the partners involved,\" Shockney says.\n\nYet Shockney says her husband of nearly 35 years would have wanted her to do everything possible to survive.\n\n\"If someone said to my husband, 'I know this has been a rough road for you, and a big impact on your sex life, but if she stays on it another five years. it could affect her survival,' he would have said, 'Please, please, take the pill.' \"", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Availability is well-established in the story.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Last year, in an operating room at the University of Toronto, a 63-year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease experienced something she hadn't for 55 years: a memory of her 8-year-old self playing with her siblings on their family farm in Scotland. \n\n \n\n The woman is a patient of Dr. Andres Lozano, a neurosurgeon who is among a growing number of researchers studying the potential of deep brain stimulation to treat Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. If the approach pans out, it could provide options for patients with fading cognition and retrieve vanished memories.\n\nRight now, deep brain stimulation is used primarily to treat Parkinson's disease and tremor, for which it's approved by the Food and Drug Administration. DBS involves delivering electrical impulses to specific areas of the brain through implanted electrodes. The technique is also approved for obsessive-compulsive disorder and is being looked at for a number of other brain disorders, including depression, chronic pain and, as in Lozano's work, dementia.\n\nIn 2008, Lozano's group published a study in which an obese patient was treated with deep brain stimulation of the hypothalamus. Though no bigger than a pea, the hypothalamus is a crucial bit of brain involved in appetite regulation and other bodily essentials such as temperature control, sleep and circadian rhythms. It seemed like a reasonable target in trying to suppress excessive hunger. To the researcher's surprise, following stimulation the patient reported a sensation of deja vu. He also perceived feeling 20 years younger and recalled a memory of being in a park with friends, including an old girlfriend. With increasing voltages, his memories became more vivid, including remembering their clothes.\n\nUsing a 3-dimensional brain mapping technique called standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography, or sLORETA, Lozano's group uncovered an explanation for the unexpected findings. They found that stimulating the hypothalamus was in turn driving increased brain activity in the hippocampus, a key cog in the brain's memory circuitry. As Alzheimer's progresses, not only does the hypothalamus atrophy, but electrical communication between neurons in the region also gradually becomes impaired.\n\nThat our memories \u2014 so entwined with our personalities and senses of self \u2014 might be so vulnerable to a brown out is, existentially speaking, rather alarming. There's something palpably dehumanizing about reducing our past selves to the exchange of electricity between neurons, and also about retrieving memories by hot-wiring the brain.\n\nYet the prospect of the latter is undeniably intriguing. Given that Alzheimer's affects 1 in 9 people over the age of 65 and that current therapies are in many patients dismally ineffective, Lozano felt all but obligated to dig further. His group launched a test in six patients and published the results in the Annals of Neurology in 2010.\n\nThe study included patients with mild and severe disease who received stimulation in the fornix continuously for 1 year. \"The fornix is like the highway leading into the hippocampus,\" explains Lozano. \"It's easier to stimulate than the hippocampus itself and crucial to memory function.\" As expected those with more severe disease continued to mentally deteriorate, however it appeared that in those with mild disease, cognitive decline slowed with stimulation.\n\nNext, Lozano launched a randomized trial involving 42 patients from the US and Canada, all of whom had electrodes implanted in the fornix on both sides of the brain. In half the patients the stimulation was turned on right away. In the other half the stimulation wasn't turned on for a year, though they didn't know it.\n\nPreliminary results, published in December 2015 in the Journal of Neurosurgery, were mixed but encouraging.\n\nGiven that so few people have had electrical stimulation applied to memory circuits, perhaps the most significant finding was that both the surgery itself and DBS of the fornix appear safe. No serious long-term neurological side effects were seen in either patient group, supporting future research in the field.\n\nIn terms of efficacy, however, after one year there were no significant differences in cognition between the groups, as measured by two scales commonly used to measure Alzheimer's disease symptoms, the ADAS-Cog and CDR-SB. Alzheimer's tends to progress slowly and reversing or slowing the neurodegeneration associated with condition may take time to become noticeable. Lozano's final results won't be reported until four years out.\n\nMore intriguing for now were comparisons of glucose utilization. Glucose is our brains' primary fuel. The degree to which glucose is burned is a commonly used measure of brain activity. Patients with Alzheimer's typically have reduced glucose activity in their brains, as well as, again, shrinking memory circuits. The older patients in Lozano's study who had stimulation turned on exhibited markedly increased glucose use in the brain's memory regions. Not only that, the hippocampus of some study patients who received DBS actually increased in size.\n\nReversing withering hippocampi by encouraging the growth of new neurons is seen as a holy grail in Alzheimer's research, and Lozano's finding is supported by a recent animal study demonstrating that DBS in rats causes the release of growth factors that induce neuronal growth in the hippocampus.\n\nLozano acknowledges that retrieving childhood memories, which he says has occurred in about one-third of his patents \u2014 requires lofty voltages that he would be uncomfortable sending patients home on. Yet he's encouraged by the early findings that suggest the procedure is safe. \"We also know that in patients who receive stimulation there is an increase in glucose utilization in memory areas of the brain,\" he says, a finding that could mean there's a way to overcome some of the damage from Alzheimer's.\n\nEvidence supporting DBS in dementia is emerging from other research groups as well. A 2012 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that in seven patients receiving DBS to a brain region called the entorhinal cortex, spatial memory improved \u2013 meaning they could more easily remember the locations of newly learned landmarks. The entorhinal cortex works in concert with the hippocampus to solidify memories.\n\nA group at the University of Cologne in Germany is instead focusing on delivering DBS to a part of the brain called the nucleus basalis of Meynert, another region in which impaired neuron function is thought to contribute to Alzheimer's. Last year they published a study in Molecular Psychiatry in which four of six patients either remained cognitively stable or improved in response to DBS, as measured by the ADAS-cog. Like in Lozano's study no serious side effects were seen.\n\nDespite the mounting evidence for DBS, not everyone is convinced.\n\nReferring to Lozano's second clinical study, Dr. Nader Pouratian, a neurosurgeon and DBS researcher at UCLA, comments, \"The recent deep brain stimulation trial for Alzheimer's disease clearly demonstrates the safety of this approach for trying to treat the progression of disease. Unfortunately, [the findings] suggest that the therapy may not be as robust as initially proposed.\"\n\nHowever he acknowledges Lozano's results suggest that DBS to the fornix might be promising for a subgroup of patients, those being older people with less severe disease.\n\n\"The most promising areas are likely the fornix or the entorhinal area,\" he says. \"But I believe further studies are necessary to better elucidate the efficacy of this treatment before proceeding to a larger scale randomized trial.\"\n\nIn a 2008 episode of the medical television drama House, the show's main character Dr. Gregory House survives a bus crash that leaves his memory murky. In an attempt to remember the medical history of a fellow collision victim \u2013 and inspired by Lozano's initial paper \u2014 House voluntarily undergoes deep brain stimulation. Following the procedure the grouchy TV doctor's memory returns. As is customary on the show, he cracks the case.\n\nDBS for treatment of Alzheimer's and other dementias is a field in its infancy. Unlike on TV, in all likelihood it won't be widely used anytime soon to retrieve specific memories. \"Even though House did this, we're not doing it yet,\" cautions Lozano.\n\nYet the fact that the therapy can in some people rescue recollections \u2013 albeit random ones \u2013 and possibly induce new neuron growth in memory regions of the brain seems reason enough to pursue it further.\n\n\"We're hoping to use electricity to drive activity in areas of the brain involved in memory and cognition,\" says Lozano. \"We want to turn these brain networks back on.\"\n\nBret Stetka is a writer based in New York and an editorial director at Medscape.

The 50 women treated had progressed despite a median 5 previous treatment regimens. Twenty-seven percent of these heavily pretreated patients saw clinical benefit from the drug, with at least \"stable disease\" at 24 or more weeks after the start of treatment. These data led to two subsequent Phase Ib studies, resulting in tucatinib earning FDA fast-track status and the expansion of this study once meant only to demonstrate drug safety into the \"pivotal\" trial that will determine approval.\n\n\"Usually we expect the results of a phase 1 clinical trial to give us data that we can use to guide the results of future treatments. This is a great case in which, for many of these patients, the results were immediate. There are women who are alive today because of this drug,\" says Virginia Borges, MD, MMSc, director of the Breast Cancer Research Program and Young Women's Breast Cancer Translational Program at the University of Colorado Cancer Center. Borges has been a major driver of the drug's development from its invention at Array Biopharm in Boulder, CO and now through clinical trials of the drug, which is licensed to Cascadian Therapeutics of Seattle, WA.\n\nTucatinib is a small molecule inhibitor of the HER2 growth factor receptor. The drug works by targeting the HER2 \"tyrosine kinase\" - a link in the chain of communication that allows HER2 receptors to signal the growth of the cell. The fact that it is a small molecule means the drug is able to pass through the blood-brain barrier to act against brain metastases of the disease. HER2+ breast cancer is more likely to affect younger women and also more likely than other breast cancers to metastasize specifically to the brain.\n\nWorking with Borges's Young Women's Breast Cancer Translational Program at CU Cancer Center, young investigator Elena Shagisultanova, MD, PhD, recently earned a $1.4m competitive ASPIRE grant from Pfizer, Inc., to conduct a clinical trial exploring the use of tucatinib against so-called \"triple positive\" breast cancer - those cancers driven by both estrogen and progesterone receptors and the HER2/neu oncogene.\n\n\"When both [estrogen and HER2] are positive, they counteract the therapy aimed at one or the other, playing off each other like kids splitting parents,\" Borges says. More specifically, when both avenues are present, the crosstalk leads to tumors being resistant to treatment, as either avenue can allow the cancer to survive therapy. Previous trials concurrently targeting estrogen and HER2 have been, according to Borges, \"lackluster,\" resulting in no changes to the standard of care.\n\nThe forthcoming trial lead by Shagisultanova will be a multi-center clinical trial with CU Cancer Center as the lead site, testing the combination of three drugs - tucatinib plus the anti-estrogen receptor drug letrozole and the cell cycle inhibitor palbociclib - against breast cancers positive for both HER2 and estrogen receptors.\n\n\"Tucatinib could be a substantially practice-changing drug,\" Borges says, meaning that in addition to the drug's current investigations as a third-, fourth-, or more-than-fifth-line treatment, she envisions its use sooner in the arc of breast cancer treatment and with far more patients.\n\n\"I think this drug has an extremely high likelihood of being approved for women with HER2+ breast cancer for use after previous treatments,\" Borges says. \"And it's going to be an especially important drug due to its ability to control brain metastases. The opportunity to study it as a front-line drug for recurrent triple positive breast cancer could even someday help us prevent or delay these brain metastases.\"\n\nBecause the drug is taken in pill form and has a very favorable side effect profile, Borges points out that it is relatively patient-friendly, allowing women to avoid treatments in infusion centers and also many of the side-effects associated with chemotherapies.\n\nOngoing updates are expected in journals and meetings later in 2017.", "question": "Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "No information in the news release gives an indication as to when (or if) tucatinib might be widely available.\nThe lead researcher\u2019s comment that \u201cI think this drug has an extremely high likelihood of being approved for women with HER2+ breast cancer for use after previous treatments\u201d is problematic given that the investigative drug is still in early trials and has not yet been FDA approved.

The vaccine won approval from the Food and Drug Administration on Feb. 3, and some doctors have received supplies of it.\n\nThe recommendation for universal use of the vaccine was approved at a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the federal panel that sets vaccination policy in the United States. It comes nearly seven years after an earlier rotavirus vaccine was withdrawn from the market for causing a potentially life-threatening form of intestinal blockage in some babies.\n\nVaccine-safety advocates are urging parents to be wary of the new vaccine because of that history. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the manufacturer, Merck & Co. Inc. of Whitehouse Station, N.J., have promised elaborate studies to catch any safety problems. Merck is selling the vaccine under the brand name RotaTeq.\n\nMerck has tested the vaccine in about 70,000 babies in 11 countries, one of the biggest vaccine trials ever conducted. That test ruled out a safety problem similar to the one that felled RotaShield, an earlier rotavirus vaccine developed by Wyeth, a drugmaker in Madison, N.J. But doctors said it is impossible to design a test big enough to catch all possible side effects that might show up once the product is used in millions of children.\n\nRotaTeq \"generally appears to have a better safety profile than the earlier vaccine,\" said Umesh D. Parashar, a medical epidemiologist at the CDC. \"But at the same time it's something we'll continue to look at, and hopefully confirm absence of risk.\"\n\nRotaTeq is expected to be one of the most expensive vaccines ever marketed, with Merck listing it at $187.50 wholesale for the three-dose series. That means many doctors are likely to charge more than $300 retail, putting the Merck product in league with Prevnar, an expensive Wyeth vaccine that has been widely used in the United States for five years. Prevnar, which protects children against certain types of pneumonia, became the first vaccine to meet the pharmaceutical industry's standard for a blockbuster product, with sales exceeding $1 billion a year.\n\nThe development of such high-priced vaccines is causing strains, particularly in state-sponsored vaccination programs for certain low-income children. But it is also drawing new manufacturers into the vaccine market, which many drug companies had abandoned in the 1980s and 1990s, citing too little profit.\n\nRotaShield appeared on the market in late 1998 but was pulled less than a year later after a handful of babies that received it developed a serious intestinal problem called intussusception, a type of bowel obstruction that occurs when the intestine folds in on itself, like a collapsing telescope.\n\nThe problem occurs naturally, albeit rarely; it showed up at a sharply elevated rate in babies who received RotaShield. Intussusception is life-threatening for some babies, though doctors can usually treat it.\n\nMany people have never heard of rotavirus, but it is one of the most common causes of childhood illness -- many ailments that parents or pediatricians describe as \"stomach flu\" are caused by rotavirus infection. Virtually every child in the world contracts the virus repeatedly by age 5, gradually building immunity.\n\nMost children get over rotavirus at home, but at least 55,000 American children are hospitalized every year after becoming dehydrated from vomiting and diarrhea associated with the infection. Fifty to 60 of them die, but it is a different story overseas, where babies often do not receive good medical care and hundreds of thousands die every year.\n\nRotaTeq contains live, but weakened, strains of rotavirus designed to build immunity without causing illness.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Highlight\n\u2022 A healthy diet high in fruits, vegetables, fish, legumes, cereals, whole grains, and fiber, and low in red meat, salt, and refined sugars was linked with a reduced risk of early death in an analysis of 7 studies.\n\nNewswise \u2014 Washington, DC (December 8, 2016) \u2014 A diet that emphasizes healthy foods rather than individual nutrients may help patients with chronic kidney disease live longer. The findings appear in an upcoming issue of the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (CJASN).\n\nPatients with chronic kidney disease are advised to follow dietary recommendations that restrict individual nutrients such as phosphorus, potassium, protein, and sodium; however, empirical evidence suggests that these restrictions\u2014which can be difficult to abide by\u2014have limited effects on reducing patients\u2019 risk of premature death.\n\nEmerging evidence indicates that overall eating patterns may have greater effects on patients\u2019 health and longevity.

Then it fell out of favor.\n\nToday, the most common reason for the surgery is \"sleep disordered breathing,\" a broad diagnosis that includes sleep apnea and snoring. About 10 percent of elementary-school-age children snore.\n\nDoctors say snoring can cause bed-wetting, behavior problems, short stature and poor school performance. That's a far cry from the 1950s and '60s, when tonsillectomy was used to fight frequent sore throats.\n\nBack then, it was the most popular surgery in the United States. In the 1960s sitcom Leave It to Beaver, Beaver Cleaver was so impressed by his dad's tales of ice cream and pretty nurses that he schemed to have his tonsils out, even though he didn't need it.\n\nThe tonsils are two glands that sit at the base of the tongue and are part of the body's immune system. The premise of tonsillectomies, back in their heyday, was that tonsils get infected themselves and no longer help fend off germs.\n\nThen doctors started noticing that kids were still getting sore throats, even after having their tonsils taken out. But it wasn't until clinical trials were completed in the early 1980s that there was proof that tonsillectomy really only helped children with severe, recurrent throat infections.\n\n\"It was becoming unacceptable to just take tonsils out because they were there or you had a few infections,\" says Richard Rosenfeld, an ear, nose and throat doctor at SUNY Downstate in Brooklyn, N.Y. \"People were growing up with their tonsils.\"\n\nBut growing up with tonsils can create another problem: snoring. Lisa Moran of Takoma Park, Md., remembers what it sounded like when her son ,Tyler Scorza, now age 7, slept.\n\n\"It was loud,\" Moran says. \"You could hear him through he closed door, down the hall, snoring, and he would occasionally stop breathing.\"\n\nAt first, Tyler's pediatrician thought he'd outgrow the snoring. But he wasn't sleeping well and often didn't have any energy. The doctor recommended a head X-Ray, and the radiologist said that though Tyler's adenoids were enlarged, they weren't that bad.\n\nBy then, Tyler had been dealing with this for almost three years. He started getting frequent nasal infections. So his parents took him to an ear, nose and throat doctor. He said, sure, the adenoids are swollen.\n\n\"But the real problem is the tonsils!\" Moran recalls. \"He showed us on the X-ray that there was a tiny passage between the tonsils and the back of his throat \u2014 very small.\"\n\nEnlarged tonsils (and adenoids) are the most common cause of sleep-disordered breathing in children. So the doctor recommended tonsillectomy.\n\nBut Tyler's parents were worried about the surgery. It's usually done as an outpatient procedure now, but with general anesthesia. That's never without some risk.\n\n\"Your child is under,\" says Moran, \"completely under. This is not a local.\"\n\nOther complications include pain after surgery and the risk of bleeding; about 4 percent of people have complications that require readmission to the hospital.\n\nDespite hundreds of studies, there's still surprisingly little research on whether tonsillectomy really helps reduce the risk of sore throats. The operation continues to be controversial.\n\nNo less a personage than President Obama dissed tonsillectomy when he was stumping for health care overhaul in July 2009. In a prime time news conference, Obama said that doctors may think: \" 'You know what? I make a lot more money if I take this kid's tonsils out.' \"\n\nRosenfeld disputes Obama's claim, saying insurers usually pay a surgeon $200 to $300 for tonsil surgery.\n\nThe picture is further clouded because not all children with big tonsils have sleep-disordered breathing or frequent throat infections. Because of that, in 2002 the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that children have a sleep study before surgery is considered.\n\nAbout 530,000 tonsillectomies are performed in the United States each year. Obviously, parents could use some help in deciding whether surgery is needed. In January, the American Academy of Otolaryngology issued its first guidelines on tonsillectomy in children.\n\nWith sore throats, the ENTs recommend waiting (and treatment with antibiotics, if needed), unless a child has more than seven infections in a year. They'd recommend surgery if a child has five or more throat infections a year for two years, or three or more in three years.\n\nThere have been very few randomized studies on the effects of tonsillectomy for sleep-disordered breathing. Most of the researchers have asked parents or children whether they noticed improvements, and looked at a single measure, like behavior or quality of life. Still, the ENTs recommend tonsillectomy for sleep-disordered breathing, saying it reduces symptoms in most children.\n\nTyler's family decided to go ahead with the surgery; they went to the hospital at 5 a.m., and Tyler was home by noon. The doctors said he would be out of school for a week, but a throat infection kept him home a second week. His classmates sent him get-well cards.\n\nA year later, Tyler is feeling great. And his snoring is gone. \"Completely gone,\" his mom says. \"You can hear a pin-drop quiet when he sleeps.\"\n\nTyler still hears snoring at night, he says.
