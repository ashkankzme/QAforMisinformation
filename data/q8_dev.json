But they also suffered more side effects than patients not taking the medication.\n\n\"The question was to see if more weight loss could be achieved if we provided decent quality lifestyle intervention, mostly dietary counseling, along with this medication,\" said study lead author Dr. Kishore Gadde, director of the Obesity Clinical Trials Program at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C.\n\n\"And the answer was yes,\" Gadde said.\n\nThe research, funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, appears online Oct. 15 in the journal Archives of Internal Medicine.\n\nFor obese men and women who can't control their weight through diet and lifestyle changes, nonsurgical options are limited, the study authors noted. Just a few prescription medications are approved in the United States for long-term treatment of obesity, including orlistat (brand name Xenical) and lorcaserin hydrochloride (Belviq).\n\nGadde and colleagues set out to follow up on a 16-week investigation they conducted in 2003 that had indicated that zonisamide (Zonegran) at a dosage of 400 milligrams a day might offer an alternative.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2011 the study team randomly assigned more than 200 obese men and women to one of three groups. One group took 200 milligrams of zonisamide daily, another got 400 mg of zonisamide daily and one received a dummy pill. The participants' average age was 43, and their average body-mass index (BMI) was nearly 38. BMI is a calculation of body fat based on height and weight, and a BMI of more than 30 is considered obese. None had diabetes.\n\nAll study participants followed their treatment plan for one year. During this time, they all also received monthly individualized nutritional counseling, which Gadde described as \"not intensive,\" to help them reduce their overall caloric intake.\n\nThose on the higher-dose zonisamide protocol fared the best in terms of overall weight loss, while the lower-dose regimen was not much more effective than the placebo.\n\nAlthough nearly 55 percent of those on the higher-dose medication shed 5 percent or more of their pre-study weight, that figure was 34 percent among the lower-dose group and 31 percent among the non-medication participants.\n\nBut patients in both drug groups faced a higher risk for side effects, including diarrhea, headache, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, concentration and memory difficulties, anxiety, and depression-related symptoms.\n\nThe authors said such side effects were typically \"mild.\" They concluded that the higher-dose zonisamide showed promise as a weight-loss aid, but advised clinicians to carefully weigh the pros and cons on a patient-by-patient basis.\n\n\"There's no medicine that is a panacea for obesity,\" cautioned Gadde. \"The important thing to keep in mind is that although we diagnose obesity on the basis of a mathematical formula -- a BMI of 30 and up -- the basis for obesity may differ from one individual to another.\"\n\nPsychological factors or lifestyle factors may play a role, he said. \"But for about a third [of patients], biological issues are at play, such as not easily experiencing satiety signals from the gut to the brain, which senses what your energy intake has been,\" he said. \"And for those people, medication can help.\"\n\nLona Sandon, a registered dietitian and assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, agreed.\n\nCaution is vital when using any drug that has been approved for one condition for another, Sandon said.\n\n\"But for many people, this kind of drug might absolutely be of great help, by doing something that helps the regulation of these appetite hormones and the regulatory pathway,\" she said.\n\nFor more on obesity, visit the U.S. National Institutes of Health.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story notes that zonisamide is already used as an anti-seizure drug.\u00a0 It did not discuss whether it\u2019s used off-label for weight loss.\nFrom an availability perspective, it also didn\u2019t provide enough detail about this statement:\n\u201cAll study participants followed their treatment plan for one year.

But you may not want to start a raucous celebration just yet. The beer was effective only if it was nonalcoholic.\n\nRunning a marathon is, of course, punishing to the body, causing muscle soreness and inflammation. Grueling exercise can also weaken the immune system, making athletes susceptible to colds and other ills in the weeks after the event. Some athletes, particularly in Europe, long had downed nonalcoholic beer during hard training, claiming that it helped them to recover, but no science existed to support the practice.\n\nTo study the matter, researchers at the Technical University of Munich approached healthy male runners, most in their early 40s, who were training for the Munich Marathon, and asked if they would \u2014 in the name of science \u2014 be willing to drink a considerable amount of beer. Two hundred seventy-seven men agreed, even when told that the beverage would be nonalcoholic. Only half of the group received the alcohol-free beer, however; the other half got a similarly flavored placebo. No one knew who was drinking what.\n\nAll of the runners downed a liter to a liter and a half \u2014 about two to three pints \u2014 of their assigned beverage every day, beginning three weeks before the race and continuing for two weeks afterward. The scientists, meanwhile, collected blood samples from the men several weeks before the race, as well as immediately before to the start, at the finish line and on select days afterward. (These were an exceptionally obliging group of racers, it seems.) They monitored levels of various markers of inflammation in the men\u2019s blood, to see whether beer helped to blunt some of the immediate damage from running.\n\nFor the next two weeks, the men continued to dutifully swallow their nonalcoholic beer or other brew. They also reported any symptoms of colds or other upper respiratory ailments that developed during that time.\n\nThe men drinking the nonalcoholic beer reported far fewer illnesses than the runners swallowing the placebo beverage. \u201cIncidence of upper respiratory tract infections was 3.25-fold lower\u201d in the nonalcoholic beer drinkers, the scientists reported, in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. They also showed significantly less evidence of inflammation, as measured by various markers in their blood, and lower counts of white blood cells than the placebo group, an indication of overall better immune system health.\n\nThese effects matter, said Dr. Johannes Scherr, lead author of the study, because if a marathon runner\u2019s body is less sore and inflamed after a race, and he doesn\u2019t develop the sniffles, he can recover and return to training more quickly than he otherwise might have been able to. \u201cIt can be speculated that the training frequency could be higher (with shorter breaks after vigorous training sessions)\u201d in those drinking beer, he wrote in an e-mail response.\n\nJust how nonalcoholic beer eases the ravages of strenuous marathon training and racing is still being investigated. But, said Dr. Scherr, it almost certainly involves the beverage\u2019s rich bouquet of polyphenols, chemical substances found in many plants that, among other things, \u201csuppress viral replication\u201d and \u201cinfluence the innate immune system positively,\u201d all beneficial for fighting off a cold.\n\nAlcoholic beer happens to be drenched in polyphenols, too \u2014 \u201ceven more than nonalcoholic beer,\u201d Dr. Scherr said \u2014 but has the signal disadvantage of being alcoholic. \u201cWe do not know whether the side effects of alcoholic beer would cancel out the positive effects caused by the polyphenols,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFurthermore, it is not possible to drink one to one and a half liters of alcoholic beer per day, especially not during strenuous training.\u201d We all knew that, right?\n\nOf course, other substances containing polyphenols have shown early promise, and then underperformed in follow-up studies. Quercetin, for instance, a polyphenol derived principally from apple skins, was widely touted by endurance athletes several years ago after studies found that large doses allowed untrained lab mice to run for far longer than untreated animals. But the supplement has largely failed to show benefits in human athletes. An analysis of 10 human studies of the supplement presented at the American College of Sports Medicine annual meeting in June concluded that quercetin supplementation \u201cis very unlikely to provide an endurance performance advantage.\u201d\n\nBut the beer experiment did not begin by looking at mice. It began with human marathoners completing a punishing, unsimulated race, and showed demonstrable benefits, in terms of minimizing postrace damage.\n\nAll of which is good news as the fall marathon season approaches. Asked if he would recommend that serious marathon runners add nonalcoholic beer to their diets, Dr. Scherr said, \u201cWhen I look at the results of our study, I would have to answer \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible to get large amounts of polyphenols from other foods, he added, like those training-table staples chokeberries and mangosteens, as well as pomegranates and grapes. \u201cBut with these foods you do not consume the minerals, fluid and carbohydrates,\u201d he said, \u201cso nonalcoholic beer seems to be optimal\u201d for everything, perhaps, apart from your well-deserved celebratory carouse after the race.

It also appears to have less risk of causing lung problems than its inhaled predecessor, Exubera.\n\n\"Afrezza is an ultra-rapid-acting insulin, and clinical studies have shown us that it has the potential to change diabetes therapy, because in the body, Afrezza looks like the insulin that's normally in a person's body,\" said Andrea Leone-Bay, vice president of pharmaceutical development for MannKind Corp., manufacturer of Afreeza.\n\n\"Afrezza differs a lot from Exubera,\" she said, both in the way it's made and in the way it works.\n\nAfrezza uses a novel technology called Technosphere, according to Leone-Bay. It's inhaled as a dry powder that dissolves in the lungs. The particles then pass through the lungs into the bloodstream and begin acting almost immediately. Afrezza's action peaks about 12 to 15 minutes after inhalation, instead of the 45 to 60 minutes it takes for Exubera to peak, she said.\n\nThat fast action helps to keep after-meal blood sugar levels lower, which is a goal for people with diabetes. And Afrezza is less likely to cause hypoglycemia, a common problem that occurs when insulin levels are higher than required for a meal.\n\nThe idea of an inhaled insulin appeals to diabetics who must use insulin every time they eat. Currently, the only way to get that insulin is through injection or an insulin pump that must be inserted in a new site under the skin every few days.\n\nIn 2006, the first inhaled insulin, Exubera, received FDA approval. However, the drug was pulled from the market in October 2007 by its manufacturer, Pfizer, because of disappointing sales. From the beginning, concerns surfaced about the effects the drug might have on the lungs. One study found a reduction in lung function for some, but of more concern was an increased risk of lung cancer associated with its use. This finding came after Exubera had been pulled from the market, and the sample size wasn't large enough to draw a definitive link between the drug and the increased risk of lung cancer.\n\nLeone-Bay said that cancer studies have been conducted on Afrezza in rats. The rats got a much higher inhalation dose than humans would take, and the researchers didn't find an increase in lung cancer. She said these types of studies weren't done on Exubera.\n\n\"They have done the required safety studies and come out clean, but it's only been tested for six months, so long-term isn't known,\" said Sanjoy Dutta, director of the insulin initiative at the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.\n\nDutta confirmed that Afrezza is fast-acting and less likely to cause low blood sugar. \"Just as quickly as it has an onset of action, it also has a quick off mechanism. It doesn't stay around long enough to cause hypoglycemia,\" he said.\n\nWhile Afrezza looks promising, it can't replace all injections for people with diabetes. Because it's fast-acting, it can't provide the long action of insulin known as basal insulin. It will only replace meal-time insulin.\n\nAfrezza may have an impact on lung function, but Leone-Bay said once people stopped taking Afrezza, this effect went away. The company is conducting clinical trials to assess Afrezza in people with asthma.\n\nLeone-Bay was to explain the Technosphere technology Tuesday at the American Chemical Society annual meeting in San Francisco. MannKind hopes the technology used in Afrezza might help deliver drugs that treat pain and osteoporosis, too.\n\nLearn more about both types of diabetes and treatments from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The article makes it clear that the product is not approved by the FDA for use at this time.\u00a0It needs to be pointed out that the story makes FDA approval seem like a foregone conclusion.

Three of them found that zinc acetate in daily doses of more than 75 milligrams (mg) shortened colds' duration by 42 percent, on average.\n\nFive trials using zinc salts other than acetate in daily doses greater than 75 mg shortened colds by an average of 20 percent, while another five using less than 75 mg per day produced no effect.\n\n\"Much of the variation in the published study findings can be explained by the daily dose of zinc administered in the zinc lozenges,\" said Hemila, who funded the research himself. \"When focusing on those studies which have used large daily doses of zinc, there is strong evidence that zinc lozenges shorten the duration of colds.\"\n\nThe study is published in The Open Respiratory Medicine Journal.\n\nDespite the popularity of zinc supplements, controversy over their effectiveness has continued since a much-publicized 1984 study first suggested a cold-limiting effect. Allowing the lozenge to dissolve instead of swallowing it seemed to provide a therapeutic effect. Since then, more than a dozen studies have been carried out, but data on the trace mineral's effectiveness has been mixed.\n\nAll of the trials examined by Hemila compared zinc lozenges to placebos. While surprised to note how strong the correlation was between daily doses of zinc and its effect on colds' duration, he said he and his colleagues still don't know why it seems to work.\n\n\"In the evidence-based medicine framework, we are primarily interested in the question whether there is an effect, and how great, whereas the mechanism of the effect is a secondary issue,\" he said.\n\nNo prior studies showed zinc lozenge use -- even up to 150 mg per day -- might cause harm aside from bad taste or constipation, Hemila said, and the most recent trial on zinc acetate indicated no significant differences between zinc and placebo groups in adverse effects even though the daily zinc dose was 92 mg.\n\nDr. Lisa Winston, an epidemiologist at San Francisco General Hospital, praised the study as a \"pretty good synthesis of the data,\" although she noted that the trials Hemila reviewed involved small numbers of participants.\n\n\"It's an area of controversy and question . . . but I don't think the evidence is strong enough, nor do I think the author is suggesting, that we can base clinical practice on it,\" said Winston, also an associate professor in the University of California-San Francisco Department of Medicine. \"I would tell my patients we still don't have a cure [for the common cold], and we don't know if zinc works.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Library of Medicine has more about the common cold.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story mentioned the \u201cpopularity of zinc supplements\u201d but never established how popular, widespread are their use and never explained\u00a0\u00a0 if the lozenges on market shelves are at the same dosages as discussed in the story.\nWe can\u2019t give it a satisfactory score; we\u2019ll rule it N/A.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "Newswise \u2014 BOSTON \u2013 (February 19, 2015) \u2013 In the first clinical trial directly comparing three drugs most commonly used to treat diabetic macular edema, researchers found all were effective in improving vision and preventing vision loss. However, one drug, aflibercept, provided greater improvement for people with more severe vision loss when treatment was initiated. The trial was conducted by the National Eye Institute Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net) including researchers from Joslin Diabetes Center. The results appeared in the February online edition of the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nDiabetes is a significant risk factor for developing eye diseases. The most common diabetic eye disease and a leading cause of blindness is diabetic retinopathy, which is caused by elevated blood sugar levels damaging the blood vessels of the retina and affects approximately 7.7 million Americans. About 750,000 Americans with diabetic retinopathy have diabetic macular edema (DME) in which fluid leaks into the macula, the area of the retina used when looking straight ahead. The fluid causes the macula to swell, blurring vision. \u201cDME is the leading cause of moderate vision loss in working-age adults with diabetes. With the rate of diabetes increasing dramatically worldwide, many individuals will be at risk for vision loss from diabetic eye complications and DME is a major global health concern,\u201d says Jennifer K. Sun, M.D., M.P.H., a member of the study research team and writing committee, and an Investigator in the Section on Vascular Biology, an ophthalmologist in Beetham Eye Institute at Joslin and an Assistant Professor at Harvard Medical School.\n\nIn an earlier study, Joslin researchers reported that VEGF, a major growth factor for blood vessels, is elevated in the eye fluids of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and DME, causing leakage and the growth of abnormal blood vessels. Over the past few years, drugs that target VEGF have become a standard treatment for DME, providing a preferred alternative or adjunct to laser treatment. The standard Medicare per-injection costs of the three anti-VEGF drugs evaluated in the study are about $1960 for aflibercept (Eylea), $1200 for ranibizumab (Lucentis) and $70 for bevacizumab (Avastin).\n\nAt the start of the trial, 660 adults with DME were enrolled: their average age was 61 years and 90 percent had type 2 diabetes. About half of the participants had 20/32 or 20/40 vision and the other half had vision of 20/50 or worse. They were randomized into three treatment groups and received the assigned study drug by injection into the eye until the DME resolved or stabilized. Participants on bevacizumab and ranibizumab received, on average, 10 injections, versus nine for those on aflibercept.\n\nOne year after starting treatment, all participants had improved vision. Those with mild vision loss (20/32 to 20/40) at baseline in all three treatment groups gained on average almost two lines on an eye chart. For participants with more severe vision loss (20/50 or worse), aflibercept improved vision on average nearly four lines, bevacizumab about 2.5 lines, and ranibizumab almost three lines.\n\n\u201cThe results clearly remove any doubts about anti-VEGF drugs\u2019 efficacy in treating DME. All three drugs improved vision substantially, with aflibercept showing more visual gains in patients with worse vision at the start of the trial. Physicians now have robust data to help them counsel patients and make informed decisions regarding treatment options,\u201d says study co-author Lloyd P. Aiello, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School, Director of Joslin\u2019s Beetham Eye Institute, co-head of Joslin's Section of Vascular Cell Biology, and founding chair of the DRCR Network.\n\nIn light of these positive results, \u201cit is more important than ever for patients with diabetes to be evaluated on a regular basis for eye disease and receive treatment promptly once indicated as we now have excellent success in treating patients with DME,\u201d says Dr. Aiello.\n\nThe trial was supported through a cooperative agreement from the National Eye Institute and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

It is diagnosed in 235,000 U.S. men each year and kills more than 27,000, making it the most common cancer and second-leading cancer killer, after lung cancer, among men.

But the therapy worked vastly better than University of Pennsylvania researchers David L. Porter, MD, Carl H. June, MD, and colleagues had dared to hope.\n\n\"Our results were absolutely dramatic. It is tremendously exciting,\" Porter tells WebMD. \"These kinds of outcomes don't come around very often.

A manmade virus-like vector is used to transfer special molecules to the T cells. One of the molecules, CD19, makes the T cells attack B lymphocytes -- the cells that become cancerous in CLL.\n\nAll this has been done before. These genetically engineered cells are called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. They kill cancer in the test tube. But in humans, they die away before they do much damage to tumors.\n\nWhat's new about the current treatment is the addition of a special signaling molecule called 4-1BB. This signal does several things: it gives CAR T cells more potent anti-tumor activity, and it somehow allows the cells to persist and multiply in patients' bodies. Moreover, the signal does not call down the deadly all-out immune attack -- the feared \"cytokine storm\" -- that can do more harm than good.\n\nThis may be why relatively small infusions of the CAR T cells had such a profound effect. Each of the cells killed thousands of cancer cells and destroyed more than 2 pounds of tumor in each patient.\n\n\"Within three weeks, the tumors had been blown away, in a way that was much more violent than we ever expected,\"June says in a news release.

These VOCs produce a unique smell print for each individual and specific patterns are seen in people with asthma.\n\nThe new study included 27 people with intermittent or mild persistent asthma and 24 healthy people. None of the study volunteers had a history of smoking. Those with asthma had a history of allergies, and none had been treated with corticosteroids for at least four weeks prior to the start of the study.\n\nCurrently, asthma is diagnosed \"based on your medical history and symptoms, and with spirometry (lung function testing) and exhaled nitric oxide,\" said Dr. Thomas Leath, director of allergy and immunology at Scott & White Healthcare in Round Rock, Texas.\n\nThe Italian researchers wanted to compare the electronic nose to the other commonly used tests -- spirometry and FENO -- to see which test was best at confirming a diagnosis of asthma.\n\nTo do this, all of the study volunteers were given all three tests. Each test is non-invasive, requiring only the use of exhaled air.\n\nThe electronic nose was able to correctly differentiate healthy people from those with physician-diagnosed asthma in 87.5 percent of the cases. FENO was able to correctly identify asthma in 79.2 percent of the study volunteers and lung function testing (spirometry) discerned just 70.8 percent of the people with asthma.\n\nWhen the electronic nose and FENO were combined, the two tests together correctly identified almost 96 percent of the asthma cases.\n\n\"This is potentially a great tool.

People with a family history of melanoma are better off wearing sunscreen and getting regular skin checks from a dermatologist, Asgari recommended.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just too early\u201d to say NSAIDs offer any protection, she said. \u201cI think the jury is still out.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s reason to hope NSAIDs might offer some protection against this type of cancer, however - earlier this year, a review found that people who use painkillers such as ibuprofen on a regular basis may be less likely to get bladder cancer. Other research has consistently supported the benefits of NSAIDs in preventing colorectal cancer, and provided some evidence they may work for breast, esophagus, and stomach cancers, as well.\n\nMelanoma is the most lethal form of skin cancer, killing almost 9,000 people in the U.S. last year, according to the National Cancer Institute.\n\nTo investigate whether NSAIDs offer any protection, Dr. Clara Curiel-Lewandrowski of Harvard Medical School and the University of Arizona asked 400 people diagnosed with melanoma and 600 similar people without the disease to recall their use of the painkillers.\n\nThe researchers found that people without cancer had a longer history of taking NSAIDs than people who eventually developed melanoma. Specifically, more than 40 percent of people who were cancer-free said they\u2019d been taking NSAIDs at least once per week for more than 5 years, versus only 28 percent of those who developed melanoma. Overall, regular use of NSAIDs for more than 5 years appeared to reduce the risk of developing cancer by more than 40 percent, the authors report in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology.\n\nUnfortunately, the technique \u2014 comparing people with melanoma to those without - is fraught with potential problems, said Asgari. For one, you have to get the comparison right, she noted; there\u2019s always a concern that people without cancer who agree to participate in the study may be more health conscious to begin with, and it\u2019s this that protects them from cancer, not their use of NSAIDs. \u201cDid you somehow get a biased sample of people, and is that why you\u2019re seeing this difference?\u201d\n\nHer 2008 study analyzed data from nearly 64,000 people who were melanoma-free at the beginning of the investigation, then followed them for a few years to see who developed the disease.

Rather, they said that for certain patients who may not be eligible for more standard surgical approaches, the therapy has potential as an alternative means for offering an improved quality of life for a longer period of time.\n\n\"'Promising' is the perfect way to describe our findings,\" said study lead author Dr. David Woodrum, an interventional radiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. \"But whether or not this minimally invasive approach would ultimately become a primary method of treatment in the future will depend on the long-term results of this trial, which is still under way. At this point I would say that cryoablation has the most applicability as a kind of last-ditch treatment for patients who are not good surgical candidates for a variety of reasons.\"\n\nWoodrum and his colleagues are scheduled to discuss their findings Sunday in New Orleans at the annual meeting of the Society of Interventional Radiology. Funding for their work was provided by Galil Medical, a medical device manufacturer based in Arden Hills, Minn.\n\nBecause this study was presented at a medical meeting, the conclusions should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute points out that while cryoablation (also known as cryosurgery) is a well-known practice, researchers are still in the process of assessing its long-term benefits.\n\nThe procedure is performed by an interventional radiologist on patients coping with metastasized lung tumors, the researchers noted. Using CT-imaging equipment, the physician inserts a small needle-like instrument directly into the tumor to deliver the freezing power (at temperatures as low as minus 100 degrees Celsius) of liquid nitrogen to cancer cells, while sparing healthy surrounding tissue.\n\nTo date, the team behind the new study has used the procedure to tackle a total of 36 tumors in 22 American and French patients --13 men and nine women -- whose average age was 60. Fifteen patients had just one tumor, while the rest had two or more. None of the patients was deemed eligible for standard surgical interventions.\n\nThe targeted tumors were less than 3.5 centimeters (about 1.4 inches), which Woodrum described as being \"small to medium in size.\"\n\nThe procedure was performed under either general anesthesia or conscious sedation, and lasted anywhere from 45 minutes to nearly three hours. Typically, patients were able to return home the following day.\n\nThe result: Among the 15 patients seen roughly three months post-procedure, tumor control was found to be 100 percent, although six patients were found to have developed new lung tumors in the interim.\n\nAmong five patients seen six months after the procedure, tumor control continued to be 100 percent.\n\nThe authors noted that side effects were minimal, typically involving air or fluid around the lungs after the procedure, and in all cases were resolved quickly.\n\nThe team concluded that cryoablation appears to be both safe and effective, at least in the short-term. But they acknowledged that more research needs to be done to track the treatment's impact over the long haul.\n\n\"It would be overreaching to say that we're curing cancer with this,\" Woodrum said. \"But this is one of many therapy options that is looking to turn cancer into a chronic fight, and to give patients for whom the choices are limited a chance at a good quality of life with minimal treatment complications.\"\n\nFor his part, Dr. David Carbone, a professor and director of the James Thoracic Center at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, said that the findings regarding cryoablation are \"not incredibly novel,\" given that the procedure has been around for years.\n\n\"And I would say that there are multiple different technologies for doing this kind of very localized approach,\" he added. He mentioned stereotactic radiosurgery -- which targets the tumor with high-power X-rays -- as another way to go.\n\n\"While I've done cryoablation myself in the past, it's not what I typically do,\" Carbone noted. \"Stereotactic is noninvasive and doesn't require general anesthesia, so that's what I'd tend to do, although certainly what approach is ideal will depend on a particular patient's situation and symptoms.

To test the pill, scientists had dozens of women expose their behinds or backs to strong UV light. They found an effect on immune cells in the skin, but the question was, would the women also get fewer sunburns and better tans?\n\nTo answer that, Laboratoires Inneov conducted a so-called randomized controlled trial \u2014 the most powerful kind of study in the scientific toolbox \u2014 in which women were randomly assigned to take Inneov Sun Sensitivity or a placebo pill.\n\nBut the researchers never compared the response directly between the two groups, the whole point of a randomized controlled trial. Instead, they used a weaker method comparing the before-and-after differences within each group.\n\nWhile Piccardi said she thought this method was appropriate, it means the company can\u2019t claim women taking their product had a higher threshold for sunburns than those taking a placebo pill. The same goes for the tan.\n\nAs a result, said Schalock, the company\u2019s claim that women taking their product can sunbathe with less concern of getting burned might be a stretch.\n\nSchalock told Reuters Health he has a \u201chard time seeing that statistically or scientifically they have proven it.\u201d\n\nThe fact that the company did the testing itself could also raise a red flag.\n\n\u201cThere is some evidence to indicate that we are right to be concerned about the quality of research when there is a conflict of interest,\u201d said Josephine Johnston, a bioethicist at the Hastings Center in Garrison, New York.\n\nJohnston, who said she could not speak to the scientific merits of the Inneov report, said other studies had shown industry-funded research is more likely to have positive outcomes, and that people could be influenced by financial interests even if they didn\u2019t realize it.\n\n\u201cThe major problem,\u201d she told Reuters Health, \u201cis that it has an impact of trustworthiness.\u201d\n\nBranding personal care products with clinical claims is a very common strategy, an expert who studies consumer marketing told Reuters Health.\n\n\u201cClaiming that kind of a benefit is certainly something people respond to,\u201d said the expert, a professor at an East Coast university who asked to remain anonymous because his institution receives funding from the cosmetics industry.\n\nWhile some people will want to see and feel an impact, he said, for many the clinical claim alone suffices. \u201cThe key question is, will the consumer view as credible that ingesting a pill will prevent (sun) damage?\u201d\n\nIn another experiment, Laboratoires Inneov scientists gave the tanning pill to 80 women and asked them to sunbathe as they normally would over the summer, applying sunscreen at their discretion.\n\nThen they asked dermatologists, recruited by a company paid by Laboratoires Inneov, a series of questions about how these women fared. According to the report, the dermatologists told Laboratoires Inneov the product prevented sunburns.\n\n\u201cWe truly believed that this kind of study, taking into account consumers\u2019 opinion, complements experimental and control studies,\u201d said Piccardi.\n\nBut the study did not answer a number of questions: How did the women usually do in the summer? Did they end up like boiled lobsters or were they careful not to get burned? Might they have been extra cautious because they were part of a skin protection study?\n\n\u201cIt would have been nice to really know that it worked, and that it\u2019s not just a placebo effect,\u201d Schalock said.\n\nHe pointed out it was hard to draw any conclusions from this part of the study because it didn\u2019t include any data. What kind of evaluations did the dermatologists do? What exactly did they tell Laboratoires Inneov?\n\nOf more than a dozen researchers and dermatologists contacted about the quality of this study, only Schalock agreed to comment.\n\nDr. Tobias W.

And while those eating the most salt had, on average, a slight increase in systolic blood pressure \u2014 a 1.71-millimeter increase in pressure for each 2.5-gram increase in sodium per day \u2014 they were no more likely to develop hypertension.\n\n\u201cIf the goal is to prevent hypertension\u201d with lower sodium consumption, said the lead author, Dr. Jan A. Staessen, a professor of medicine at the University of Leuven, in Belgium, \u201cthis study shows it does not work.\u201d\n\nBut among the study\u2019s other problems, Dr. Briss said, its subjects who seemed to consume the smallest amount of sodium also provided less urine than those consuming more, an indication that they might not have collected all of their urine in an 24-hour period.\n\nDr. Frank Sacks of the Harvard School of Public Health agreed and also said the study was flawed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a problematic study,\u201d Dr. Sacks said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be guiding any kind of public health decisions on it.\u201d\n\nDr. Michael Alderman, a blood pressure researcher at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and editor of the American Journal of Hypertension, said medical literature on salt and health effects was inconsistent. But, Dr. Alderman said, the new study is not the only one to find adverse effects of low-sodium diets. His own study, with people who had high blood pressure, found that those who ate the least salt were most likely to die.\n\nDr. Alderman said that he once was an unpaid consultant for the Salt Institute but that he now did no consulting for it or for the food industry and did not receive any support or take any money from industry groups.\n\nLowering salt consumption, Dr. Alderman said, has consequences beyond blood pressure. It also, for example, increases insulin resistance, which can increase the risk of heart disease.\n\n\u201cDiet is a complicated business,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are going to be unintended consequences.\u201d\n\nOne problem with the salt debates, Dr. Alderman said, is that all the studies are inadequate. Either they are short-term intervention studies in which people are given huge amounts of salt and then deprived of salt to see effects on blood pressure or they are studies, like this one, that observe populations and ask if those who happen to consume less salt are healthier.\n\n\u201cObservational studies tell you what people will experience if they select a diet,\u201d Dr. Alderman said. \u201cThey do not tell you what will happen if you change peoples\u2019 sodium intake.\u201d\n\nWhat is needed, Dr. Alderman said, is a large study in which people are randomly assigned to follow a low-sodium diet or not and followed for years to see if eating less salt improves health and reduces the death rate from cardiovascular disease.\n\nBut that study, others say, will never happen.\n\n\u201cThis is one of those really interesting situations,\u201d said Dr. Lawrence Appel, a professor of medicine, epidemiology and international health at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions. \u201cYou can say, \u2018O.K., let\u2019s dismiss the observational studies because they have all these problems.\u2019 \u201d But, he said, despite the virtues of a randomized controlled clinical trial, such a study \u201cwill never ever be done.\u201d It would be impossible to keep people on a low-sodium diet for years with so much sodium added to prepared foods.\n\nDr. Briss adds that it would not be prudent to defer public health actions while researchers wait for results of a clinical trial that might not even be feasible.\n\n\u201cThe low-salt advocates suggest that all 300 million Americans be subjected to a low-salt diet. But if they can\u2019t get people on a low-salt diet for a clinical trial, what are they talking about?\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt will cost money, but that\u2019s why we do science.

The balloons take up space in the stomach, which presumably makes people feel fuller faster, the FDA said in its announcement Tuesday.\n\nBut the device can only be used for six months at a time, and it is not likely to be an alternative for people who require lap-band surgery, stomach stapling or other forms of bariatric surgery, said Dr. Mitchell Roslin, chief of obesity surgery for Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\n\"It's going to be effective for short-term weight-loss,\" Roslin said, \"but there is still an overwhelming question whether these devices provide any long-term benefit for obesity.\"\n\n\"I don't think it's going to be part of the medical algorithm for treating obesity,\" he added. \"I think it's going to be for people who want to lose weight fairly rapidly.\"\n\nIn a clinical trial, the ReShape system helped people more than double their weight loss compared to those trying to lose weight through diet and exercise, an FDA news release said. That clinical trial was funded by the company that makes the ReShape system, according to a presentation from the Obesity Society annual meeting in Boston.\n\nThe device is available to obese people who often don't qualify for surgical weight-loss procedures, according to the FDA. Obese people who have a body-mass index (a rough estimate of body fat based on your height and weight) between 30 and 40 and at least one obesity-related health condition are eligible for the new procedure, the agency said. Obesity-related health conditions include high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol.\n\nIt's also intended for those who have been unsuccessful in trying to lose weight through diet and exercise alone, the agency said.\n\nDoctors insert the balloons through a scope snaked down the throat and into the stomach, and then fill them with saline containing a blue dye. It takes about eight minutes to place the balloons, and about 14 minutes to remove them, according to Dr. Jaime Ponce, medical director of the bariatric surgery program at Hamilton Medical Center in Dalton, Ga. Ponce was the principal investigator of the clinical trial on the ReShape system.\n\nThe device doesn't change the stomach's natural anatomy, according to the FDA. Patients are told to follow a medically supervised diet and exercise plan, to help them lose weight while they have the device in their stomach and to maintain weight loss after the device is removed.\n\nA pair of connected balloons are used because earlier single-balloon versions tended to dislodge and migrate down the digestive tract, blocking the bowels, Roslin explained.\n\nWith ReShape, if one of the balloons ruptures then the other balloon will keep it in the stomach. The blue dye that filled the balloon will turn a patient's urine blue, letting the person know that one of the balloons has ruptured. Doctors can then go back in and retrieve the entire device.\n\nNausea is a common side effect of the device. In the clinical trial, about 15 percent of patients had to have the balloons removed prematurely due to intolerable nausea, according to Ponce.\n\n\"The first few days are associated with a fair amount of nausea, and you will need some coaching to get through that,\" Roslin said.\n\nAnother troubling side effect is gastric ulcers caused by the balloons rubbing against the stomach wall. About 35 percent of patients in the clinical trial suffered ulcers, but researchers said most of the ulcers were small and superficial.\n\nRoslin also believes that, for now, patients will have to pay cash for the ReShape. \"It is not going to be reimbursed by insurance, at least for the first generation and certainly for the foreseeable future,\" he said.\n\nThe balloons have been available in Europe since 2011, where their average price is about $6,200, according to the manufacturer, ReShape Medical Inc. in California.\n\nThe people who initially will use the ReShape are people who can afford to pay for it out-of-pocket and need to drop some pounds quickly, Roslin said.\n\nIn the clinical trial, the 187 participants who used the device lost an average of more than 14 pounds, or about 7 percent of their total body weight. Patients who did not receive the device lost about half that amount of weight -- just over 3 percent of their total body weight, the FDA said.\n\nFor more information on how being overweight or obese affects your health, visit the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story makes clear the device has just won FDA approval, and has been available in Europe.\u00a0But the story doesn\u2019t comment on what might be the obstacles to use in the US. \u00a0What training is required? \u00a0How many physicians have been trained? \u00a0How might availability be held back if (as the story appropriately suggests) patients have to pay cash for it?

As part of the condition, they also have lower levels of acetylcholine, a chemical which helps us to concentrate - making it extremely difficult to pay attention to walking.\n\n\"We already know that rivastigmine works to treat dementia by preventing the breakdown of acetylcholine, however our study shows for the first time that it can also improve regularity of walking, speed, and balance. This is a real breakthrough in reducing the risk of falls for people with Parkinson's.\"\n\nDr Henderson and her team at the University of Bristol studied 130 people with Parkinson's who had fallen in the past year. Half the group were given rivastigmine capsules and the other half a placebo for an eight month period.\n\nDr Arthur Roach, Director of Research at Parkinson's UK, which funded the study said:\n\n\"People affected by Parkinson's, their carers, and health and social care professionals have said that preventing falls and improving balance is the biggest unmet need for people living with the condition, other than finding a cure.\n\n\"Things that may be simple to us, such as walking upstairs or getting up in the middle of the night to get a glass of water, or go to the toilet, are much harder and more dangerous when you could easily fall. You risk breaking bones and then needing an emergency hospital admission.\n\n\"This trial shows that there may be drugs already available, being used for other purposes, that can be tested to help treat Parkinson's.

However, daily intake of tomatoes may give better protection.\" \n\n \n\n Karppi says it's the chemical lycopene that gives tomatoes and other fruits/vegetables their rich red color, that is helping to protect the brain. Tomatoes are particularly high in the powerful antioxidant that acts like a sponge, soaking up rogue molecules called free radicals that if left unchecked can damage cells.\n\nResearchers tested the level of lycopene in the blood of more than 1,000 Finnish men aged 46 to 65, starting in 1991. Scientists then followed the men on average for more than a decade to record the number who had strokes.\n\nThe scientists found that those with the highest levels of lycopene were 55% less likely to have a stroke than those with the lowest amounts in their blood.\n\nThough the study looks promising, experts say that we can't necessarily give all of the credit to lycopene.\n\n\"It's a compelling study and it fits with other data that we have about risk of stroke and vegetable and fruit consumption,\" explains Dr. Daniel Labovitz, director of the Stern Stroke Center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York. \"But it's not proof that if you eat tomatoes you're going to have less risk of stroke.\"\n\nLabovitz also points out that the group of men who had fewer strokes were younger, had lower blood pressure and smoked less than the group more prone to stroke. Though the researchers tried to take these lifestyle factors into account when calculating their findings, it may be that these things influenced the outcomes.\n\nIn other words, perhaps better health habits - not necessarily just the lycopene - lead to fewer strokes.\n\nLycopene has attracted a lot of attention in recent years because it's such a powerful antioxidant. If we don't eat enough lycopene-packed foods, experts suspect too many free radicals get left in the body, damaging blood vessels by helping to form fatty deposits. When these deposits build up, a blockage forms. If that vessel is in the brain, the blockage can cause a stroke.\n\nBut the foods we eat are complex and filled with many nutrients, making it tough to prove what is really providing benefits.\n\n\"Eating tomatoes is a good thing, but we don't know if there is really anything unique about tomatoes apart from other fruits and vegetables that reduce stroke risk,\" explains Dr. Walter Willett, chair of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nTomatoes could contribute to reducing stroke in other ways, Willett says, because they are a good source of potassium, which is known to reduce blood pressure. Elevated blood pressure is major risk factor for stroke.\n\nSo are lycopene packed tomatoes really the magic fruit? It seems the jury is still out, but researchers suggest we eat healthy as they continue to search for answers.\n\n\"This is one more reason to consume fruits and vegetables - at least 5 a day - and it's good to include tomatoes in that mix,\" Willett said.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The availability of tomatoes is not in question.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "TUESDAY, July 24, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The active ingredient in pot that gets you high can calm agitation in people with advanced Alzheimer's disease, a small new study suggests.\n\nCanadian researchers found that a form of synthetic THC significantly decreased agitation in a small group of Alzheimer's patients, working even better than the drugs now used.\n\n\"This is the first clinical trial to show that a cannabinoid can decrease agitation,\" said lead researcher Krista Lanctot, a senior scientist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center in Toronto.\n\nHowever, many study patients suffered from sedation due to the drug, noted Keith Fargo, director of scientific programs and outreach at the Alzheimer's Association.\n\n\"We would love to see this study done in a larger group of people, to see if it continues to be effective in a larger group, and how worried we need to be about this sedation side effect,\" Fargo said.\n\nAgitation is a frequent symptom of advanced Alzheimer's, Lanctot explained. Doctors struggle to control it through off-label use of drugs like antipsychotics and anticonvulsants.\n\nAgitated patients yell, scream, pace and wander, she said. They also can become physically aggressive, striking out at people and hurting themselves or others.\n\n\"You're going to find one in five outpatients with it. But when you get to the long-term care facilities, about 50 percent of inpatients will have agitation,\" Lanctot said. \"It's actually a big treatment challenge. The drugs we have now do not work very well and they're associated with an increase in mortality.\"\n\nThe off-label drugs used to treat Alzheimer's are indeed a bit dodgy. For example, only one person out of five to 14 treated with antipsychotics actually experiences a decrease in agitation, Lanctot said. And for every nine to 25 people helped, one will die.\n\nBut Lanctot and her colleagues suspected that cannabinoids might help control agitation, given that natural cannabinoids in the brain decrease as Alzheimer's enters its advanced stages.\n\n\"We know cannabis has several effects that might be good for people with agitation,\" Lanctot said. \"It has a calming effect. It helps with weight loss because it helps with appetite. It's also used for pain.\"\n\nThe synthetic THC drug, nabilone, is approved in Canada for treating nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy. It comes in capsule form.\n\n\"It's a milder form of TCH\" compared to whole-leaf marijuana, Lanctot said. \"We hoped it wouldn't have the side effects associated with cannabis, but would have the calming effects.\"\n\nDuring the clinical trial, 39 patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease received nabilone for six weeks to treat their clinically significant agitation, followed by six weeks with an inactive placebo.\n\n\"We had a significant decrease in agitation. The decrease we saw was larger than is seen with the currently used medications,\" Lanctot said.\n\nPatients underwent significant overall improvement in their other behavioral symptoms, and had small benefits in their brain function and nutrition during the study. Their caregivers also reported reduced levels of stress, according to Lanctot.\n\nThese benefits came with a downside, though. About 45 percent of patients experienced sedation with nabilone, compared with 16 percent for placebo, the findings showed.\n\nLanctot and Fargo do not recommend that relatives or friends of those with agitated Alzheimer's provide them medical marijuana to ease their suffering.\n\n\"This trial tested a synthetic analog of THC. It's not THC, and it's certainly not whole-plant marijuana,\" Fargo said. \"There's virtually no data on whole-plant marijuana, whether or not it's effective or safe in people with Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\nA form of synthetic THC is available in the United States, called dronabinol and sold under the trade name Marinol, Lanctot said. It's used as an appetite stimulant for people with AIDS and an anti-nausea remedy for chemotherapy patients.\n\nMarinol is now being tested for its usefulness in treating Alzheimer's symptoms, Lanctot said. People interested in trying it should reach out to one of the big clinical trials; Johns Hopkins is one of the centers testing Marinol.\n\n\"We wouldn't want to change clinical practice based on one study,\" Lanctot added.\n\nThe study was to be presented Tuesday at the Alzheimer's Association meeting in Chicago.

And even when we starve ourselves thin, we often can\u2019t reverse those alterations. So we just slowly pack the pounds back on because our brains think we need them.\n\nBack in the early '90s, doctors thought they had struck gold with a combination of drugs, fenfluramine and phentermine, or fen-phen, that seemed to magically melt fat away. But within a couple of years some patients began to develop very scary side effects: damage to heart valves that could lead to heart failure and a kind of high blood pressure, pulmonary hypertension, that proved to be fatal in some cases.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration called on drugmakers to pull fenfluramine \u2014 the culprit part of the combo \u2014 which they did. The media attention that followed would scare patients off diet pills for years \u2014 a fear that continues today.\n\nBut with America growing fatter with each passing year \u2014 two-thirds of Americans are now overweight or obese \u2014 doctors believed that they had no choice but to continue their quest for a safe, and at least moderately effective, medicine that would help patients drop excess pounds and keep them off.\n\nThe latest generation of drugs seems to do just that. They won\u2019t make a morbidly obese patient model-thin, but they\u2019ll shave off enough excess fat to improve heart disease risk factors such as hypertension, high blood sugar and high cholesterol, experts say.\n\nTake lorcaserin, for example. Researchers found that the drug could lead to consistent and sustained loss of more than 5 percent of weight in nearly 40 percent of patients at risk for heart attacks, strokes and death from cardiovascular disease without increasing the likelihood of such events, according to a report published recently in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThe new study followed participants for three years. \u201cMost prior studies of weight loss only followed patients for a year, and a few out to two years,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Erin Bohula, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a cardiologist and investigator with the TIMI Study Group at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. \u201cThe challenge with lifestyle interventions is that patients tend to lose weight up front, and then the weight is regained, sometimes beyond the original weight. So the challenge is to keep it off long term.\u201d\n\nWhile a 5 percent weight loss may not seem like a lot, \u201cthat is the point where there is a very significant reduction in the risk of diabetes,\u201d said Dr. Louis Aronne, a professor of metabolic research at Weill Cornell Medicine. \u201cA 5 percent loss of weight is associated with a 50 percent lower risk of diabetes and a 10 percent loss is associated with an 80 percent lower risk.\u201d\n\nPatients in Bohula\u2019s study did see improvements in hypertension and blood sugar levels with weight loss.\n\nPeople need to realize that in obesity treatment, just as in hypertension therapy, one drug won\u2019t fit all, Aronne said. \u201cIn hypertension, there are more than 100 medications and more than 10 therapeutic categories,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s why treatment of hypertension is so effective. No one medication for hypertension works for every single person. That\u2019s how we need to start looking at drugs for obesity.\u201d\n\nWhat many don\u2019t understand is that weight gain leads to changes in the brain that may not be reversible, Aronne said. \u201cThe process of weight gain makes it hard to lose weight,\u201d he explained, adding that in certain areas of the brain nerve cells are actually damaged and sometimes die.\n\nThat new understanding is why some major medical associations have come to see diet pills as intrinsic in the battle against obesity.\n\nWeight loss drugs are recommended supplements to diet and exercise \u2014 included, for example, in 2013 guidelines by the American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology and the Obesity Society, Bohula said. But there still \u201care relatively low rates of use. There are probably a few reasons for this, including cost, if not covered by insurance, and a perception that these agents are not safe in light of the history with weight loss agents.\u201d\n\nIn fact, a 2017 report that examined the medical records of 2.2 million patients found that fewer than one in 50 patients who were eligible for a diet pill prescription received one.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t surprise Dr. Vijaya Surampudi, an endocrinologist and an assistant professor of medicine at the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cI prescribe them all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they are not very popular.

The SelectMDx test can help predict the likelihood that clinically significant prostate cancer will be found by a biopsy.\n\nThe study published in The Journal of Urology, led by researchers at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, was designed to elucidate the cost-effectiveness of SelectMDx in a population of U.S. men with elevated PSA, a marker of prostate cancer risk. Researchers analyzed the impact of utilizing the non-invasive diagnostic test prior to prostate biopsy. The primary objective was to characterize changes in health outcomes, measured in quality-adjusted life years, and a secondary objective was evaluating healthcare costs.\n\nThe researchers found that incorporating SelectMDx resulted in an average gain of 0.045 life years, or approximately 16 days, in full health gained at a cost-savings of $1,694 for each patient undergoing biopsy. Extrapolating these data to a conservative estimate of 311,879 patients per year undergoing biopsy resulted in 14,035 life years in full health gained with an annual cost saving of more than $500 million for each cohort.\n\n\"This study demonstrated that routine use of SelectMDx to guide biopsy decision-making improves health outcomes and lowers healthcare costs associated with prostate cancer risk assessment in a population of U.S. men,\" said Dr. Matthew Resnick from the departments of Urologic Surgery and Health Policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN. \"We believe that this strategy improves the value of conventional risk assessment strategies through improvements in both quality and cost, the numerator and denominator of the health care value equation.\"\n\nEvery year, 1.3 million men in the U.S. undergo a prostate biopsy.i Although a biopsy is the only way to diagnose prostate cancer, the procedure is invasive and results in complications in 18 percent of patients, with 3 percent hospitalized for infection within 30 days.ii,iii,iv Common complications from a prostate biopsy may include bleeding, infection, sepsis/bacteremia, urinary symptoms/retention, and sexual dysfunction.\n\n\"While biopsy is the only path to prostate cancer diagnosis, no man wants to, nor should have to, go through the uncomfortable, costly procedure if it can be avoided,\" said Dr. Jan Groen, Chief Executive Officer of MDxHealth. \"We developed SelectMDx to help reduce unnecessary biopsies and now we have the data to show how we can both improve outcomes and save the system money.\"\n\nThe full paper is accessible via the online edition of The Journal of Urology.\n\nAbout SelectMDx\u00ae for Prostate Cancer \n\nSelectMDx for Prostate Cancer is a proprietary urine-based, molecular diagnostic test that offers a non-invasive 'liquid biopsy' method to assess a man's risk for prostate cancer. SelectMDx helps identify men at increased risk of harboring aggressive, potentially lethal, prostate cancer who may benefit most from a prostate biopsy and earlier detection. The test helps to reduce the need for MRI procedures and invasive prostate biopsies by up to 50%, thereby improving quality of life and lowering healthcare costs per patient. SelectMDx is available in the US and all EU member states. Since the introduction of the SelectMDx test in mid-2016, over 23,000 patients have been tested and 15 commercial contracts have been signed with US based insurance companies. The test has been included in the 2018 European Association of Urology (EAU) clinical guidelines.\n\nAbout MDxHealth\u00ae \n\nMDxHealth is a multinational healthcare company that provides actionable molecular diagnostic information to personalize the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.

They\u2019re all in the brain.\n\nVarious smartphone apps say they offer this kind of vision-improving training; I used one called GlassesOff, the only one I found that was backed by scientific studies.\n\nPerceptual learning can improve the vision of people who already see quite well and those with other conditions. For example, a study tested the approach in 23 young adults, around age 24. Compared with a control group of 20 young adults, the treatment group increased letter recognition speed. Similar training is an effective component in treating amblyopia, also called \u201clazy eye,\u201d which is the most frequent cause of vision loss in infants and children, affecting 3 percent of the population. It may also improve vision in those with mild myopia (nearsightedness).\n\nIt should be acknowledged that some researchers involved in many of these studies have financial ties to GlassesOff. However, other studies with no commercial links obtained similar results, and several scientists I spoke to, including those without ties to GlassesOff, thought the science behind the app was credible.

Then the brain must coordinate activity across sets of neurons to assemble these features into recognizable objects like chairs, faces, letters or words. Reading at our normal pace, the brain has only about 250 milliseconds to do this work until the eyes automatically move onto the next letter or word.

Is an app-based self-care program particularly attractive to young women? These questions addressed in a new study by researchers from Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, the results of which have been published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology*.\n\nApproximately 50 to 90 percent of young women experience pain during their periods. While this pain primarily manifests itself as lower abdominal cramping, other symptoms include headache, backache, nausea and diarrhea. Acupressure is a technique derived from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). In contrast to acupuncture, this technique can be used as a form of self-care and is suitable for use at home. Rather than using needles, this technique involves massage or pressure being applied to specific points on the body.\n\nThe researchers wanted to evaluate whether in a group of women suffering from severe menstrual pain, aged between 18 and 34, self-acupressure would be more effective at achieving a sustained reduction in menstrual pain than usual care alone (e.g. pain medication and hormonal contraceptives). A total of 221 participants were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups, both of which received a study app and short introduction. Acupressure-based features - with instructions on how to administer self-acupressure shortly before and during menstruation - were only made available to the intervention group. One advantage of an app-based intervention is its ability to provide visual descriptions of the pressure points users need to target in order to achieve the desired effect. It can also send regular reminders. Additionally, the app was used to collect all study-related data.\n\n\"Initially, we simply wanted to conduct a study on the use of self-care techniques for menstrual pain. However, the women who were involved during the planning stages, all of whom were affected by menstrual pain, wanted an app,\" reports the study's principal investigator, Prof. Dr. Claudia Witt of the Institute of Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics. The app helped participants to apply simple self-acupressure techniques to three different acupressure points.\n\nAfter three months, 37 percent of participants in the acupressure group reported a 50 percent reduction in pain intensity. After six months, this proportion had increased to more than half of the women in this group (58 percent). Only 25 percent of women in the control group reported a similar reduction in pain intensity at both the 3-month and 6-month marks. Women in the acupressure group also used less pain medication than women in the control group and reported lower levels of pain overall.\n\n\"We were surprised to see that, after six months, two thirds of participants continued to use self-acupressure. So far, research into the clinical effectiveness of apps has been limited, and only a few have been tested using randomized controlled trials,\" says Dr. Daniel Pach of the Institute of Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics. He adds: \"We were able to show that apps can be evaluated in a clinical trial setting. However, despite our experience with conventional clinical trials, there was a lot for us to learn - something we found both exciting and eye-opening.\" The app Luna has recently been updated and optimized for use with iOS.\n\n*Susanne Bl\u00f6dt, Daniel Pach, Sanna von Eisenhart-Rothe, Fabian Lotz, Stephanie Roll, Katja Icke, Claudia M.

But soon, it seems, they will have an alternative to this painful regimen: drugs that can be taken by mouth.\n\nEasier To Take, More Impact\n\nThis week's issue of The New England Journal of Medicine reports on two new drugs that can be taken orally to slow the progress of MS. The studies for these drugs, which are not yet on the market, were funded by the drug manufacturers.\n\nDr. John Richert, executive vice president of research and clinical programs at the National MS Society, says the introduction of these pills will mark a major improvement in the lives of MS patients.\n\n\"What we've had available the last 16, 17 years has made a big difference,\" Richert says, \"and what we have coming onboard now, these are going to make even a larger difference. It's really an important advance.\"\n\nThe main benefit of the pills will be that they are easier to take. Richert believes this simpler option will encourage more people to seek treatment.\n\n\"People will be more prone to take them early, more prone to stay on the drugs,\" Richert says.\n\nThe new pills also appear to be more effective than most current drugs. In clinical tests they reduced the number of flare-ups by more than half. The drugs now on the market typically reduce flare-ups by only a third. Such relapses reflect underlying nerve damage, so reducing their number is an indicator that less damage is taking place.\n\nJeffrey Babin, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, was diagnosed with MS nearly seven years ago, when he was 39. He says the discovery shook his world.\n\n\"This is a very scary disease. And when you have an episode, it is one of the most life-changing and life-re-evaluating events,\" Babin says.\n\nHe has been free of MS relapses for several years now, an improvement that may be attributed to the drug Copaxone, one of a half-dozen drugs on the market now that can slow the course of MS.\n\nBabin says he is grateful for the drug \u2014 but he has to go through the painful process of injecting it every day.\n\n\"Injections are no fun; nobody likes to inject themselves,\" Babin says. \"In my case, I wouldn't say there are any major side effects, but I do get those painful welts at the injection sites.\"\n\nThose painful welts are something he would happily do without \u2014 and the new pills could be the answer.\n\nDr. Peter Calabresi of Johns Hopkins University School of Medical is an author of one new study. He is excited about the new drugs, but cautious.\n\n\"It's extremely exciting. I'm happy to have a new choice, especially a pill,\" Calabresi says. \"I think we also have to be careful and not use it too abruptly or too easily.\"\n\nCalabresi says many people think of pills as safer than injections, but this may not be the case.\n\n\"In reality, these are extremely potent pills that have the potential to cause a variety of serious side effects,\" he says.\n\nThese dangers are nothing new \u2014 the MS drug Tysabri was pulled from the market after some patients came down with rare brain infections. It was later reintroduced with strict monitoring requirements.\n\nIn light of that experience, federal regulators may go slowly with the two new drugs, called fingolimod and cladribine.\n\nWhen considering changes to his own medicinal regimen, Babin says he will go slowly too.\n\n\"In spite of the fact that I hate injections, I probably would not leap at the first pill that comes to market,\" he says. \"You want to be careful to jump into something new and risk the side effects from something you haven't tried before.\"\n\nMeanwhile, approval of another new oral MS drug may come soon.

The study, funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), appears in the December 28 issue of JAMA Cardiology.\n\nFenofibrate is primarily used to help reduce elevated levels of triglycerides, or fat, in the blood. But the researchers wanted to know if the drug, when combined with statin treatment, could also reduce the risk of heart disease in people with type 2 diabetes. People with type 2 diabetes are at high risk of cardiovascular-related events, such as heart attacks, stroke, and even death, often because their levels of triglycerides are so high, and their high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels are low.\n\nTo answer their question, the researchers followed 4,640 participants from the NHLBI-funded Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Lipid Study for five years after the conclusion of the trial in 2009.

That means screening 1,250 women five times over a 10-year period would save one life, study author Hakan Jonsson said during a teleconference Wednesday. The research was published online Wednesday in the journal Cancer and is to be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual Breast Cancer Symposium, which starts Friday in National Harbor, Md.\n\nThe findings will no doubt do little to quell a controversy that has existed since the 1980s over the value of mammography screenings for women in their 40s.\n\nLast year, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended that women in their 40s not at high risk for breast cancer could forego mammograms until they turned 50 and, even then, it said they only needed to undergo screening once every two years.\n\nThat recommendation met with outrage from breast cancer specialists, while other organizations, including the American Cancer Society, continued to recommend annual mammograms for women in their 40s.\n\nTo further stir the pot, a Norwegian study released last week found that routine mammograms accounted for only about one-third of the decline in breast cancer death rates seen recently.\n\nThe value of mammograms for women 50 and older is not in question.\n\nSpeaking at the teleconference, Dr. Jennifer Obel, chair of the American Society of Clinical Oncology's communications committee, said: \"This study adds to our knowledge of mammogram performance in this age group. Many women aged 40 to 49 want unambiguous recommendations. While the optimal schedule of regular mammograms continues to be discussed by experts in the field, the critical message here is that all women starting at age 40 should talk to their doctor to understand the benefits and risks of screening and to understand what is best.\"\n\n\"Mammography has been shown in study after study to reduce breast cancer deaths in women aged 40 to 49,\" Obel added. \"The real message is that any time we order a diagnostic test, we need to discuss that test with our patients. It remains the best method we have available to detect breast cancer early in the general population.\"\n\nThe authors of the new research, the largest epidemiological study of its kind, looked at screening and mortality data for women in Sweden. Although screening is mandated for woman aged 50 to 69 in that country, the decision to screen earlier is made by individual counties.\n\nThe study authors compared death-registry data on women in their 40s who had been invited by their county to be screened with data on women who had not been invited. In all, more than 1 million women were involved in the study and the follow-up period was a lengthy 16 years.\n\nThe reduction was estimated at 26 percent to 29 percent, depending on the model used, according to the study. The reduction was greater when only those women that actually attended screening were considered.\n\nThe benefits were greater in women aged 45 to 49, vs. those aged 40 to 44, the researchers said.\n\nJonsson, an associate professor of cancer epidemiology at Umea University in Sweden, could not pinpoint exactly why his findings differed from those of other studies. He mentioned certain differences in methodology as a possible factor, as well as the possibility that mammographic techniques have improved over the years.\n\nIn another study released during the Wednesday press conference, researchers from M.D. Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas in Houston found that overall survival rates among breast cancer patients in the past six decades have increased, a trend due largely to earlier detection and treatments.\n\n\"There was a significant improvement in survival overall, including all patients with all stages of breast cancer...even those who had disseminated cancer,\" said study author Dr. Aman Buzdar, a professor of medicine and breast medical oncology at M.D. Anderson.\n\nAlthough the data, which covered breast cancer patients who were treated at M.D. Anderson between 1944 and 2004, came from a single institution, Buzdar said he believes the results can be generalized to other breast cancer patients.\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on mammography.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story does not discuss availability of mammography, but such availability is really not in question.\u00a0 So this is judged not applicable because we can\u2019t give it a satisfactory or an unsatisfactory score.

In Britain, around 35,000 men are diagnosed with it and some 10,000 die from the disease.\n\nThe most effective screening tests currently available are based on a single biomarker called prostate specific antigen (PSA). But PSA testing is problematic because it has low specificity, which generates high false positive rates and leads to unnecessary surgical and radiotherapy treatment.\n\nA U.S. study published last year found that routine PSA prostate screening has resulted in more than one million American men being diagnosed with tumors who might otherwise have suffered no ill effects from them.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, PSA testing is the best method we have to detect prostate cancer but it has significant limitations, so there is an urgent need to find new biomarkers such as MSMB that could be used in screening and diagnosis,\u201d said Rosalind Eeles of the ICR and The Royal Marsden Hospital, who also worked on the study.\n\nThe protein \u2014 which regulates prostate cell death \u2014 is produced by normal prostate cells.\n\nThe scientists took tissue and urine samples from around 350 men both with and without prostate cancer to test MSMB levels.\n\nThe results, published in the Public Library of Science (PLoS) ONE journal, showed that MSMB is found at significantly lower levels in the urine of men diagnosed with prostate cancer than those without the disease.

However, the therapy can be very difficult for patients due to associated toxicities and because many patients are also dealing with comorbidities,\" explained Chang.\n\nProton therapy is an advanced type of radiation treatment that uses a beam of protons to deliver radiation directly to the tumor, destroying cancer cells while sparing healthy tissues. Protons enter the body with a low radiation dose and stop at the tumor, matching its shape and volume or depth. They deposit the bulk of their cancer-fighting energy right at the tumor, thereby reducing the dose to cardiopulmonary structures, which impacts the toxicity, functional status, quality of life and even survival for patients, explained Chang.\n\n\"With our study, we hypothesized that proton therapy would offer a survival benefit to patients and reduce treatment-associated toxicities, which can be very serious,\" he said.\n\nThe study opened at MD Anderson in 2006; in this research, Chang and his colleague report on the study's five-year results.\n\nFor the prospective Phase II trial, 64 patients with inoperable, Stage III non-small-cell lung cancer were enrolled. The study's primary endpoint was OS. The researchers hypothesized that the median OS would increase from historical data of 16 months on standard therapy to 24 months. Secondary endpoints included distant metastasis and local and regional recurrence rates. Toxic effects of treatment in both the acute and late settings also were analyzed.\n\nMedian follow up was 27.3 months for all patients, and 79.6 months for alive patients. At five years, the median OS was 26.5 months, and the corresponding five-year OS was 29 percent. Median progression-free survival was 12.9 months, with a five-year progression-free survival of 22 percent.\n\nIn sum, 39 patients experienced a relapse, with distant sites representing 62 percent of all recurrences. Local and regional recurrence rates were low, 16 percent and 14 percent, respectively.\n\nAmong the acute and late toxic effects diagnosed in patients were: esophagitis, pneumonitis and cardiac arrhythmia. Of note, said Chang, no patients developed the most severe, or grade five, toxicities, as seen in patients who receive standard of care.\n\nChang noted his study is not without limitations. Of greatest significance: the study was designed more than a decade ago. While the study's survival, recurrence rates and toxic effects are still favorable when compared to rates associated with the most advanced traditional photon radiation therapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), technology to diagnose and stage the disease, as well all treatment modalities have significantly improved.\n\n\"When the study opened, PET imaging had just been approved for lung cancer staging. The image quality was poor and didn't include a CT component in most facilities across the country,\" said Chang. \"Obviously, the technology has improved dramatically over the last decade and has made a significant impact on diagnosis and staging. Also, delivery of both the conventional intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and proton therapy (IMPT), have improved, thereby reducing side effects for both treatment modalities.\"\n\nFor example, MD Anderson proton therapy patients with advanced lung cancer now can receive IMPT. The technique uses an intricate network of magnets to aim a narrow proton beam at a tumor and \"paint\" the radiation dose onto it layer by layer. Healthy tissue surrounding the tumor is spared, and side effects are even more reduced than earlier proton delivery, said Chang.\n\nChang also noted the advancements in cancer biology and immunotherapy and that both are important areas of research focus in combination with proton therapy.\n\nIn addition to Chang, other authors on the all-MD Anderson study include: Stephen Hahn, M.D., Ritsuko Komaki, M.D., Pamela K.

Raji, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of radiology at Washington University's Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology. \"We showed that a single MRI scan can predict dementia on average 2.6 years before memory loss is clinically detectable, which could help doctors advise and care for their patients.\"\n\nAlzheimer's disease is a progressive, irreversible brain disorder that destroys memory and thinking skills. The disease affects 5.5 million Americans, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nNeurologists can get a ballpark estimate of a patient's risk of Alzheimer's dementia using the Mini-Mental State Examination questionnaire, or by testing for the high-risk form of the gene ApoE, which increases a person's risk of Alzheimer's by up to 12-fold. Both tests were about 70 to 80 percent accurate in this study. Other assessments, such as PET scans for plaques of Alzheimer's proteins in the brain, are good at detecting early signs of Alzheimer's disease, but available to few patients. PET scans cost thousands of dollars and require radioactive materials not found in a typical hospital.\n\nMRI brain scans are widely available and give doctors a glimpse into what's going on inside a person's brain. Raji and colleagues at the School of Medicine including Tammie Benzinger, MD, PhD, a professor of radiology, Parinaz Massoumzadeh, PhD, and Adedamola Adedokun, as well as radiologist Pratik Mukherjee, MD, PhD, of the University of California San Francisco, analyzed MRI scans for physical signs of impending cognitive decline.\n\nThey used a technique called diffusion tensor imaging to assess the health of the brain's white matter, which encompasses the cables that enable different parts of the brain to talk to one another.\n\n\"Diffusion tensor imaging is a way of measuring the movement of water molecules along white matter tracts,\" Raji said. \"If water molecules are not moving normally it suggests underlying damage to white tracts that can underlie problems with cognition.\"\n\nUsing information from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative - a multisite collaboration that pools data, funding and expertise to improve clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease - Raji and colleagues identified 10 people whose cognitive skills declined over a two-year period and matched them by age and sex with 10 people whose thinking skills held steady. The average age of people in both groups was 73. Then, the researchers analyzed diffusion tensor MRI scans taken just before the two-year period for all 20 people.\n\nThe researchers found that people who went on to experience cognitive decline had significantly more signs of damage to their white matter. The researchers repeated their analysis in a separate sample of 61 people, using a more refined measure of white matter integrity. With this new analysis, they were able to predict cognitive decline with 89 percent accuracy when looking at the whole brain. When the researchers focused on specific parts of the brain most likely to show damage, the accuracy rose to 95 percent.\n\n\"We could tell that the individuals who went on to develop dementia have these differences on diffusion MRI, compared with scans of cognitively normal people whose memory and thinking skills remained intact,\" Raji said. \"What we need now, before we can bring it into the clinic, is to get more control subjects and develop computerized tools that can more reliably compare individual patients' scans to a baseline normal standard. With that, doctors might soon be able to tell people whether they are likely to have Alzheimer's develop in the next few years.\"\n\nAlthough there are no drugs available yet to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease, identifying those at high risk of developing dementia within the next few years could still be beneficial, the researchers said.

However, it also has been shown to increase protein in the urine and its long-term safety will need further investigation.\n\nLike aspirin, salsalate is an anti-inflammatory drug derived from salicylate and is often used to treat arthritis. Researchers say the first reports of salicylate-based drugs aiding in the treatment of diabetes were published more than a century ago.\n\nMore recently, inflammation has been implicated in development of the insulin resistance that leads to elevated blood sugar levels associated with type 2 diabetes. Aspirin has also been shown to lower blood sugar levels, but the high doses required are associated with a risk of bleeding, which limits its utility.\n\nThat prompted researchers to take another look at salsalate in reducing blood sugar levels. Salsalate contains the same active ingredient as aspirin but is associated with fewer side effects.\n\nIn the study, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers randomly assigned 108 people with type 2 diabetes to receive 3, 3.5, or 4 grams per day of salsalate or a placebo in addition to their current diabetes therapy for 14 weeks.\n\nThe results showed those who took salsalate at each of the dosage levels experienced a beneficial decrease in blood sugar A1c levels of 0.5% or more. Other markers of glycemic control and heart disease risk also improved in the three salsalate groups compared with the placebo group. No single dose of salsalate seemed safer or more effective than another.\n\nAlthough only minor side effects of salsalate use were reported, researchers say salsalate users tended to develop more protein in their urine. Elevated protein levels in the urine may indicate negative effects on kidney function.\n\nDue to the small size of the study and short follow-up time, researchers say it's too soon to recommend use of salsalate for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. But the results do merit further research.\n\n\"Because of salsalate's anti-inflammatory effects, our results suggest that inflammation plays a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and that anti-inflammatory therapy may be useful for treating diabetes,\" write researchers Allison B.

A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended last month that children under the age of 6 not be given over-the-counter cough and cold medicines.\n\nFor the study, 105 children ages 2-18 with upper respiratory tract infections that kept them awake at night were given either a dose of buckwheat honey, honey-flavored cough syrup or no treatment half an hour before bedtime.\n\nOne dose measured one-half teaspoon for children aged 2-5, one teaspoon for children aged 6-11 and two teaspoons for children aged 12-18.\n\nParents of the 35 children who received honey, given either on its own or with a non-caffeinated drink, reported they coughed less and slept better than those who gave their children nothing. The group that used honey also reported more favorable results than those who used cough syrup, but since the study group was small, those differences weren't statistically significant.\n\nOne local pediatrician said she wouldn't discourage parents from trying honey with their children, but more studies are needed to draw solid conclusions.\n\n\"In older children, if it makes them comfortable and it helps them sleep at night, then there may be a potential benefit,\" said Dr. Sara Rizvi, assistant professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine who also works at a primary care clinic at Texas Children's Hospital. \"I would be reluctant to routinely recommend to all parents that they give honey, because in some rare cases children can have reactions to honey.\"\n\nPaul, a pediatrician who practices at Penn State Children's Hospital and teaches at the university's College of Medicine, said he began the study because he was frustrated no treatment had been proven beneficial to relieve the common children's cough. Several years ago, he led another study that showed over-the-counter cough medicine was no more effective than placebos.\n\nHoney is not only cheap and readily available, it's also generally safer than cough medicine, which can have side effects or be administered in the wrong dose.\n\nHoney should not, however, be given to children under the age of 1 because it sometimes contains a bacteria that causes botulism, a rare paralytic illness that can result in death. Unlike older children, infants can't fight the bacteria.\n\nPaul's group tested buckwheat honey instead of the lighter, more popular varieties because it's known to have more antioxidant and antimicrobial effects, which have been shown in other studies to help wounds heal. Honey may suppress cough because its sweetness causes salivation that coats the throat, authors of the study suggested.\n\n\"It's kind of amazing that something so simple could be an answer,\" Paul said.\n\nThe study was paid for by the National Honey Board, an industry-funded agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

This is the first product in its class (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors) approved to treat this type of cancer.\n\n\"Tecentriq provides these patients with a new therapy targeting the PD-L1 pathway,\" said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \"Products that block PD-1/PD-L1 interactions are part of an evolving story about the relationship between the body's immune system and its interaction with cancer cells.\"\n\nTecentriq targets the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway (proteins found on the body's immune cells and some cancer cells). By blocking these interactions, Tecentriq may help the body's immune system fight cancer cells. Tecentriq is the first FDA-approved PD-L1 inhibitor and the latest in the broader class of PD-1/PD-L1 targeted biologics approved by the FDA in the last two years.\n\nTecentriq is approved for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma whose disease has worsened during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or within 12 months of receiving platinum-containing chemotherapy, either before (neoadjuvant) or after (adjuvant) surgical treatment. Urothelial carcinoma is the most common type of bladder cancer and occurs in the urinary tract system, involving the bladder and related organs. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) estimates 76,960 new cases of bladder cancer and 16,390 deaths from the disease in 2016.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Tecentriq were studied in a single-arm clinical trial involving 310 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. This trial measured the percentage of patients who experienced complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors (objective response rate). The study also looked at the difference in effect based on \"positive\" versus \"negative\" expression of the PD-L1 protein on patients' tumor-infiltrating immune cells. In all patients, 14.8 percent of participants experienced at least a partial shrinkage of their tumors, an effect that lasted from more than 2.1 to more than 13.8 months at the time of the response analysis. In patients who were classified as \"positive\" for PD-L1 expression, 26 percent of participants experienced a tumor response (compared to 9.5 percent of participants who were classified as \"negative\" for PD-L1 expression).\n\nWhile patients who received Tecentriq experienced a tumor response across the study, the greater effect in those who were classified as \"positive\" for PD-L1 expression suggests that the level of PD-L1 expression in tumor-infiltrating immune cells may help identify patients who are more likely to respond to treatment with Tecentriq. Therefore, today the FDA also approved the Ventana PD-L1 (SP142) assay to detect PD-L1 protein expression levels on patients' tumor-infiltrating immune cells and help physicians determine which patients may benefit most from treatment with Tecentriq.\n\nThe most common side effects of treatment with Tencentriq were fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, urinary tract infection, fever (pyrexia) and constipation. Tencentriq also has the potential to cause infection and serious side effects that result from the immune system effect of Tencentriq (known as \"immune-mediated side effects\"). These severe immune-mediated side effects involve healthy organs, including the lung, colon and endocrine system.\n\nThe FDA granted the Tecentriq application breakthrough therapy designation, priority review status and accelerated approval for this indication. These are distinct programs intended to facilitate and expedite the development and review of certain new drugs in light of their potential to benefit patients with serious or life-threatening conditions.\n\nTecentriq is marketed by Genentech based in San Francisco, California.

But on Oct. 23, the F.D.A. granted authority for the drug to be used in emergencies for patients hospitalized with H1N1 flu who cannot take or do not benefit from Tamiflu or Relenza.\n\nBefore that, peramivir had been available only through a more cumbersome \u201ccompassionate use\u201d procedure.

It is now beginning phase 3 trials \u2014 the last stage before seeking F.D.A. approval.\n\nVirtually all the money to develop the drug comes from $180 million in grants from the Department of Health and Human Services. Yet the company gets to keep as profit anything it makes from selling the drug to the federal government or to other governments.

Families with adults and children with epilepsy have flocked to states where medical marijuana is legal to seek treatment, Brooks-Kayal said.\n\n\"There is a fairly active and vocal group of families in Colorado who are using cannabidiol oils that are made artisanally,\" she said.\n\nTo see whether children with epilepsy would benefit from cannabidiol treatment, Devinsky led a study involving 261 people, mostly children, whose seizures had not been controlled using current anti-seizure medications. The average age of the participants was 11.\n\nEveryone received a British-made cannabidiol oil called Epidiolex, which was administered as a drop on the tongue, Devinsky said. This was in addition to their current drug therapy.\n\nAfter three months, seizure frequency declined by an average 45 percent in all participants. Almost half experienced a 50 percent or greater reduction in seizures, and about one of every 10 patients became seizure-free, the study found.\n\n\"This was a very, very treatment-resistant group, and the response was very promising,\" Devinsky said.\n\nA second study from the University of California, San Francisco, explored the long-term effectiveness of cannabidiol for children with epilepsy, by adding the marijuana-derived oil to the regular drug regimen of about 25 kids for one year.\n\nThe study found that after a year, the treatment resulted in a 50 percent reduction in seizures for 10 participants -- about 40 percent of the group. One child remained seizure-free, but 12 of the initial participants dropped out of the study because the cannabidiol didn't seem to do them any good.\n\nAlthough he said he would prescribe CBD to people with uncontrolled seizures, Devinsky said he is \"very anxious\" to see the results of ongoing randomized, controlled clinical trials. The results of one major trial are expected in the first quarter of 2016, he added.\n\nIf CBD proves effective in controlled trials, it could be two to five years before the drug is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Devinsky noted.\n\nFederal regulators also will have to weigh potential interactions of cannabidiol with other anti-seizure drugs. Another study scheduled for presentation at the meeting found that CBD appeared to enhance the effects of the epilepsy medication levetiracetam (Keppra), when given to lab mice.\n\nHowever, the oil appeared to interact negatively with two other drugs, clobazam (Onfi) and carbamazepine (Tegretol), the University of Utah researchers found.\n\nData and conclusions presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.\n\nFor more on medical marijuana, visit the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "One of the study investigators makes\u00a0it clear that federal approval for the drug could take up to five years.\u00a0 However, the story also notes that some activist families have already begun using cannabidiol oils \u201cthat are made artisanally.\u201d", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Researchers reported Wednesday that mammograms can cut the breast cancer death rate by 26 percent for women in their 40s.

The same is true for 88 percent of CRT-D patients, they noted.\n\nFive years out, those figures dipped to 68 percent for ICD patients and 54 percent for CRT-D patients.\n\nAmong those outfitted with CRT devices alone, one-year survival was pegged at 82 percent, while five-year survival came in at 48 percent, the investigators found.\n\nThe poorer prognosis for CRT-only patients was attributed to their older average age (76 years), and the fact that they may be relatively sicker overall. Patients today tend to receive CRT devices with defibrillators.\n\nThe study team also found that patients whose implants were monitored remotely, on a continual basis, by a health facility network were about half as likely to die as patients who only had intermittent in-person assessments.\n\nRemote monitoring via telephone lines and online physician access is available for all ICD and CRT-D devices, the authors noted, and enrollment in such programs is typically free with a cardiologist's recommendation.\n\n\"It's highly likely the reason these patients did better is that they were receiving earlier diagnoses, and they were also empowered to take charge of their own health care more,\" Saxon said. \"I don't think there's any reason not to put a patient on it.\"\n\nDr. Eric N.

But at our facility we think it makes caring for a patient much easier. Physicians knowing things sooner will theoretically give a patient a better chance for quicker access to appropriate care.

For women, might aspirin also help prevent breast cancer?\n\nThe researchers analyzed data on 57,164 women, most in their early 60s, who had no history of breast cancer. About 23 percent of the women reported taking a low-dose aspirin (81 milligrams), 18 percent took ibuprofen, 11 percent took full-strength aspirin (325 mg) and about 10 percent took a COX-2 inhibitor or another nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). All were taking the medication at least three times a week.\n\nOver seven years, 1,457 women got a breast-cancer diagnosis. Those taking low-dose aspirin were 16 percent less likely to have developed any type of breast cancer, compared with women who took no NSAID. They were 20 percent less likely to have developed the most common type: breast cancer that is hormone-receptor-positive and HER2-negative. The study did not find similar links between regular-dose aspirin or other NSAIDs and the risk for breast cancer.\n\n[Certain adults should take a daily baby aspirin, expert panel says]\n\nWho may be affected?\n\nWomen. About 1 of every 8 women in the United States will develop breast cancer at some point. Those who take a daily low-dose aspirin, also called a baby aspirin, usually do so to prevent cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death for women older than 25. Aspirin has been shown to help keep blood from clotting, which can help prevent heart attacks and ischemic stroke (the type caused by a blocked blood vessel in the brain). However, aspirin can increase the risk for internal bleeding, so women should talk with their doctors before starting a low-dose aspirin regimen, for any reason.\n\nThe researchers suggested that the difference in results between low- and regular-dose aspirin may have been attributable to most women taking low-dose aspirin more often than three times a week, even daily, for cardiovascular protection as opposed to more-sporadic use of regular-dose aspirin for pain relief. Hormone therapy and alcohol use were more prevalent among the participants than normal; both are considered risk factors for breast cancer and may have affected the results.

Currently, the standard treatment includes a combination of psychotherapy and prescription medications such as mood stabilizers and antipsychotics.\n\nHowever, an emerging field of research is exploring the use of probiotics--often thought of as \"good bacteria\"--as a potential new avenue for treatment of bipolar and other psychiatric mood disorders. And a new study from Baltimore's Sheppard Pratt Health System, conducted by a research team led by Faith Dickerson, finds that a probiotic supplement may reduce inflammation of the gut, which is known to exacerbate bipolar disorder. Probiotic organisms are non-pathogenic bacteria that, when present in the gut flora, are known to improve the overall health of the host.\n\nIn recent years, research has demonstrated a strong link between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. This connection, named the \"gut-brain axis\" (GBA), allows for crosstalk between the endocrine, immune, and autonomic nervous systems. The GI tract is also home to the intestinal microbiome, a complex population of roughly 100 trillion microorganisms (more than ten times the number of cells that make up the human body) that interacts with the mucosal lining of the GI tract. Studies have shown that the intimate association between the gut microbiome and GI tissue has a significant effect on the GBA.\n\nThere is also mounting evidence linking imbalances in the microbial species that make up the gut microbiome to a number of health problems including allergies, autoimmune disorders, and psychiatric mood disorders.\n\nIn the case of bipolar disorder and the GBA, previous studies have shown that inflammation, or overstimulation of the body's immune system, is a contributing factor in the disease. With this in mind, researchers developed a probiotic supplement aimed at reducing inflammation caused by microbial imbalances in the gut.\n\nA group of patients recently hospitalized for mania participated in a 6-month study to track the effects of probiotic treatment on both their mood and the status of their immune system.\n\nThe patients were randomly selected to receive either the probiotic supplement or a placebo in addition to their usual medications. The results showed that the group receiving the probiotic supplement, on average, didn't return to the hospital as quickly and required less in-patient treatment time compared to the placebo group. The beneficial effects were most pronounced in those patients who exhibited abnormally high levels of inflammation at the beginning of the study.\n\nOverall, these results indicate that changes in intestinal inflammation can alter the trajectory of psychiatric mood disorders and that modulating the intestinal microbiota may be a new avenue of treatment for patients suffering from these diseases.", "question": "Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The dosage and composition of the probiotic mixture used in this study are not clarified.

In 2009, he had routine blood work that revealed an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. When PSA is above 4 nanograms per milliliter of blood, it can be one of the first signs of a prostate tumor. Harder\u2019s PSA was 9.\n\nBy the time Harder saw a urologist, it had skyrocketed to 20. His doctor recommended the traditional next step: a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy, which involves taking random tissue samples from 12 cross sections of the prostate.\n\nOver the course of two years, Harder, 60, an MRI technologist, would have three TRUS biopsies. They were all inconclusive.\n\n\u201cIt is frustrating to have a bunch of biopsies with a rising PSA and no proof of cancer,\u201d Harder said.\n\nAfter Harder\u2019s third biopsy, his urologist was ready to throw in the towel, and that\u2019s when Harder was referred to Jinxing Yu, M.D., at VCU Health. By then, Harder\u2019s PSA was around 30.\n\nYu is the director of oncologic and prostate imaging in the Department of Radiology at VCU. Over the past five years, he has developed diagnostic techniques using MRI technology to investigate difficult cases like Harder\u2019s.\n\nAfter one MRI, Yu found Harder\u2019s tumor. After that, Yu performed a targeted biopsy guided by the MRI scanner, allowing him to take tissue samples directly from the tumor.\n\nIn 2012, he started on a treatment plan: hormone therapy for six months to shrink the tumor and prostate, and then external beam radiation to finish the job. Today, his PSA is normal.\n\nOther patients who continue to hit a brick wall with negative results from TRUS biopsies yet persistently high PSA levels may not be as fortunate.\n\n\u201cA patient had 10 TRUS biopsies and his doctors still couldn\u2019t find a tumor,\u201d Yu said. \u201cIf you do not have this kind of advanced imaging, sometimes a patient runs into a situation when a tumor can\u2019t be found and treated because it\u2019s too late \u2014 it has already metastasized. He ends up diagnosed with cancer only after the tumor has spread to his bone or lymph nodes years later.\u201d\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging and targeted biopsy for the prostate have provided relief for patients like Harder who have not been able to get an accurate diagnosis. When caught early, prostate cancer is highly treatable.\n\nMuch like someone would have an MRI to investigate the cause of back pain, the technology gives doctors eyes on what is happening in prostate tissue. VCU Medical Center is one of the major teaching hospitals in the country doing advanced multiparametric MRI, which involves taking three different types of imaging sequences of the prostate.\n\nEach of the sequences \u2014 T2 weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast enhanced imaging \u2014 tells a story, and together they can be used to make a diagnosis with more than 90 percent accuracy.\n\nInterpreting a prostate MRI to be able to correctly diagnose cancer is a skill that can take years to develop. Yu and his team look for certain patterns that are typical of cancer on each of the different sequences.\n\n\u201cIf we put those characteristic features together from each sequence then we can say with a high degree of confidence that this area is concerning for cancer and potentially target it for biopsy,\u201d said Sarah Winks, M.D., an attending physician in the Department of Radiology.\n\nAn MRI can also help determine how aggressive a tumor is, Yu said, and indicates if the tumor extends outside of the prostate and involves other areas \u2014 all information that helps urologists and radiation oncologists determine the best course of treatment.\n\nIn addition to enhancing detection of prostate cancer, magnetic resonance technology also enhances the biopsy process with a procedure called magnetic resonance/ultrasound fusion biopsy. MRI scans are overlaid with real-time ultrasound images to guide the biopsy needle to the tumor.\n\nIn 2014, VCU Health\u2019s Department of Radiology, supported by the Division of Urology in the Department of Surgery, purchased ultrasound/MRI fusion biopsy equipment. Prior to this, Yu\u2019s team had performed targeted MRI biopsies with the patient being moved in and out of the MRI scanner as the needle was guided to the target area \u2014 a sort of stop-motion procedure that could take up to an hour. The new equipment has simplified and shortened the process to about 20 minutes.\n\nA study published in 2015 by the Center for Cancer Research found that fusion biopsy is 30 percent more accurate in diagnosing high-risk, aggressive cancers than a TRUS biopsy. It is also much better at finding tumors in the anterior part of the prostate, near where Harder\u2019s tumor was located.\n\nYu credits the technology and also having a dedicated team that can perform multiparametric-MRI, read the MRI scans and conduct biopsies with a very high success rate.\n\n\u201cAt most places, there will be a radiologist reading the MR image and a clinician performing the biopsy. The person reading the image and person putting in the needle is different,\u201d Yu said. \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t get the same result. We do both. That\u2019s one of our strengths.\u201d\n\nYu has seen how MRI technology has changed prostate patients\u2019 care. \u201cFive years ago, 95 percent of patients with prostate cancer or a high PSA would never get any imaging,\u201d Yu said. \u201cRight now, I think probably 50 or 60 percent get imaging.\u201d Sometimes, these are patients pushing their doctors for a referral as one of Yu\u2019s patients did last year.\n\nLast August, Jim Grandon of Colville, Washington, discovered he had a PSA of 5.3. It was elevated from the 4.1 measurement that he had registered for a few years. The rising PSA was cause for concern. Instead of going through with an immediate TRUS biopsy recommended by his urologist, he decided to research next steps.\n\n\u201cWith just going in and doing a blind biopsy like most urologists will do, you have anywhere from 35 to 45 percent success rate,\u201d Grandon said. \u201cI found three or four places around the country with a biopsy success rate of over 85 percent. When I went back to my urologist, he said, \u2018Why spend money flying around the country when we can take care of you here?\u2019 I said, \u2018Because 85 percent is better than 40 percent.\u2019\u201d\n\nVCU Medical Center was one of the places Grandon had researched to get his diagnostic testing done, and a few phone calls later, he was on a plane flying across the country to see Yu.\n\nOn his second day in Richmond, Grandon had an MRI that showed a lesion. The next day, Yu biopsied it. On the fourth day, Grandon flew home and began researching treatment options. He opted for brachytherapy followed by external radiation at a clinic closer to home, and recently completed his treatment.\n\nMore and more, physicians are hearing about and understanding the benefits of MRI technology for prostate care, which has also been helpful in preventing overdiagnosis and overtreatment. According to the Center for Cancer Research study, MRI targeted biopsies detect 17 percent fewer low-risk tumors. These are tumors that would have never developed into a life-threatening cancer, but might lead a doctor and patient to treat it unnecessarily.\n\nWhen Yu started prostate MRI screening in 2011, his team performed about 50 scans per year. Now, with the support of Massey Cancer Center, Urology and Radiation Oncology, they are doing about 1,200 multiparametric-MRI and 200 imaging guided biopsies per year. He estimates the volume will continue to increase because VCU will attract patients not only from the Greater Richmond area but also patients such as Grandon from other parts of the country.\n\nYu hopes the advanced technology means positive changes in the standard of care.

Since it is a low-impact, gentle, non-threatening, accessible activity, it may be a perfect exercise for debilitated patients with fibromyalgia who otherwise cannot or choose not to do other forms of exercise,\" Yeh said. \"Also, since tai chi has a meditative component, it may also help to address the stress and anxiety that may be associated with the condition.\"\n\nSo what is it about tai chi that works?\n\nThere's no definitive answer to that just yet, Wang said. Tai chi is a mind-body exercise that originated as a martial art in China, utilizing slow, gentle movements to build strength and flexibility, as well as deep breathing and relaxation, to move qi, or vital energy, throughout the body.\n\nPrior research has shown exercise can improve mood, Wang added. The controlled breathing and movements may promote \"mental tranquility,\" according to the study, which could help with pain.\n\n\"The physical component of tai chi can improve aerobic capacity, strength and muscle function,\" Wang said. \"But in my opinion, the most important part is mental.

This common practice is based on the assumption that it will help them recover more quickly. An international study coordinated at KU Leuven, Belgium, has now disproven this theory. The study shows that receiving little to no nutrition during the first week in intensive care makes children recover faster.\n\nCritically ill children in intensive care are unable to eat independently. The current standard of care for such children is based mostly on the assumption that they need to eat to regain their strength. Therefore, the method that is applied worldwide is to artificially feed these children during the first days of their stay in intensive care. This artificial nutrition is meant to strengthen their muscles, prevent complications, and speed up their recovery. The artificial nutrition is infused directly into the bloodstream.\n\nAn international team of researchers from University Hospitals Leuven (Belgium), Sophia Children's Hospital Rotterdam (The Netherlands), and Stollery Children's Hospital Edmonton (Canada) has now challenged the validity of this common practice. They conducted a randomized controlled trial that involved 1,440 critically ill children. The researchers examined whether fasting or receiving very small amounts of feeding during the first week in the paediatric intensive care unit was better for the children than full feeding through an IV.\n\nThe results are remarkable. \"We found that the current practice of feeding children in an early stage does not contribute to their recovery\", says lead author Professor Greet Van den Berghe from KU Leuven / University Hospitals Leuven. \"On the contrary, the children who had built up a nutritional deficiency after receiving little to no feedings had fewer infections, less organ failure, and a quicker recovery than children who had been fed through the IV.

The drug contains only trace amounts of the psychoactive element THC and does not induce euphoria.\n\nEpidiolex was approved for patients age 2 and older who suffer from Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet syndromes. Both cause uncontrolled daily seizures and put patients at high risk for other physical and intellectual disabilities, injury and early death.\n\nThe disorders afflict fewer than 45,000 people in the United States, but experts expect Epidiolex to be prescribed for other types of epilepsy as well. The drug is the first treatment approved for Dravet syndrome.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the approval was \u201ca reminder that advancing sound development programs that properly evaluate active ingredients contained in marijuana can lead to important medical therapies.\u201d The medication, tested in three randomized, placebo-controlled trials with more than 500 patients, was effective in reducing seizures, the FDA said.\n\nGottlieb noted that the action was \u201cnot an approval of marijuana or all of its components\u201d but rather of one specific CBD medication for a particular use.\n\nThe agency, he added, remains concerned about \u201cthe proliferation and illegal marketing of unapproved CBD-containing products with unproven medical claims.\u201d\n\nIn April, an advisory committee unanimously recommended approval of the drug for the two types of epilepsy.\n\nThe FDA previously cleared medications containing synthetic versions of THC for nausea for patients getting chemotherapy and for other uses, but it had not approved any drug derived from the plant itself. Marijuana and its components, including CBD, are Schedule 1 controlled substances \u2014 meaning they are banned because they are thought to have a high abuse potential, no medical value and serious safety implications.\n\nNow that Epidiolex is approved by the FDA, cannabidiol is expected to be reclassified by the Drug Enforcement Administration within 90 days. However, it isn\u2019t clear whether such a reclassification would involve CBD products in general, the CBD formulation used specifically in Epidiolex or something else.\n\nFor those who have long argued that cannabis offers medical benefits, the FDA approval represents a milestone, \u201ca recognition that the plant is a rich source of compounds which have potential therapeutic activity,\u201d Justin Gover, chief executive of GW Pharmaceuticals, the London-based company that developed the drug, said in an interview last week. \u201cWe are just scratching the surface of what could be a range of cannabis-based medications.\u201d\n\nThe medication, which will continue to be manufactured in Britain, will be marketed by Greenwich Biosciences, the U.S. subsidiary of GW Pharmaceuticals.

It is led by Enrique Schisterman of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Results are in the current online issue of Human Reproduction.\n\nRusso says, \"One of our main findings is that there was no overall relationship between most types of physical activity and the likelihood of becoming pregnant for women who had already had one or two pregnancy losses, except for walking, which was associated with higher likelihood of becoming pregnant among women who were overweight or obese.\"\n\nWhitcomb, whose research on the determinants of fertility and pregnancy outcomes usually involves studying biomarkers at the molecular level, adds, \"Lifestyle is definitely relevant to these outcomes because it can have an effect at the molecular level. What we eat and what we do are potential factors we can change to shape our health. So this sort of research is important because it helps provide information on the things people can actually do something about.\"\n\nFurther, he says, \"We were happy to be able to add scientific evidence to general recommendations about physical activity. This is especially true for the results about walking for even limited blocks of time. Walking has great potential as a lifestyle change because of its low cost and availability.\"\n\nFor the 1,214 women in the study, the association of walking with the ability to become pregnant, known as fecundability, varied significantly by body mass index, the authors report. Among overweight/obese women, walking at least 10 minutes at a time was associated with improvement in fecundability. Further, in statistically adjusted models, women reporting more than four hours a week of vigorous activity had significantly higher pregnancy chances compared to no vigorous activity.\n\nModerate activity, sitting and other activity categories were not associated with fecundability overall or in BMI-stratified analyses, they add. Russo and Whitcomb say one finding that is still not clear is the different associations related to vigorous compared to moderate and low-intensity activities. Whitcomb says, \"We don't know what to make of the finding that high intensity physical activity may have different biological effects than walking, but our study doesn't offer enough detail to get at why vigorous activity would work differently than other levels.\"\n\nAmong a number of cautions the researchers point to in this work is that physical activity is related to other behaviors and lifestyle factors, and women who are more physically active may be different from women who are less active in many ways. Russo says, \"We did our best to try to account for the differences and to address them statistically.\"\n\nThe researchers also note that the overall generalizability of this work is limited because the study population may not be representative of the general population with regard to fecundability, and exercise habits may differ in women with prior miscarriage compared to those without.\n\nWhitcomb says another way in which this study is distinct from other work in this area has to do with who was included in the study. The EAGeR trial focused on women with a history of one or two prior pregnancy losses. However, he adds, \"We were happy to be able to conduct research considering women having the most difficulty getting and staying pregnant, and to provide messages about common lifestyle factors they may be able to address.\"\n\nThe researchers conclude that \"these findings provide positive evidence for the benefits of physical activity in women attempting pregnancy, especially for walking among those with higher BMI.

Then, moments after birth, that cord is severed.\n\nNow, research suggests there may be benefits to keeping mom and baby attached a few minutes longer.\n\nThose benefits, researchers say, likely have to do with iron.\n\nWaiting a few minutes before clamping the umbilical cord allows more iron-rich blood from the placenta to reach the newborn.\n\nIron deficiency occurs in about one in six American babies, and it's more common among those clamped quickly, said Ola Andersson, a neonatologist and pediatrician at Uppsala University in Sweden, who led a study published today in JAMA Pediatrics. Babies who are anemic often appear tired and pale.\n\nHis previous research has shown that babies whose cords were clamped a few minutes later than usual were 90% less likely than others to have iron-deficiency anemia when they were 4 months old.\n\nThe benefits of those extra few minutes may last a long time.\n\nIn the new study, Andersson found that healthy, full-term newborns whose umbilical cords were left attached for three extra minutes had better fine motor control when they reached preschool than those clamped immediately. Some 4-year-old boys who were clamped later even appeared to have better social skills.\n\nIron is essential to the developing brain, he said, and deficiencies during early months \u2014 perhaps linked to early clamping \u2014 could affect nerve and muscle control, making it harder for the child to later control a pen or interact comfortably with peers.\n\nAndersson's study marks the first time researchers have followed children to see whether the clamping makes a difference later in life. In 2011, he published a study of 400 healthy, full-term babies showing that those clamped later fared better; the new study of 263 of those children extends those findings by nearly four years.\n\nBoys showed more benefit than girls, probably because they are more likely to be iron-deficient, Andersson said.\n\nImmediate clamping started about 70 years ago out of concern that leaving the delivered infant attached to the placenta could rob the mother of too much blood.\n\nBut those doctors overestimated the benefit to the mother and didn't look at the impact their change had on the babies, said Heike Rabe, a researcher at Brighton and Sussex Medical School and University Hospitals, in the United Kingdom, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.\n\nFor babies born at full-term, \"we should trust nature more than we do now,\" she said.\n\nRabe has published reviews showing that delaying clamping for 30 seconds, or squeezing the umbilical cord to get the blood out faster, is also better for premature babies.\n\nMany countries and professional organizations, including the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have called on obstetricians to delay cord clamping in premature babies when feasible. There was not enough evidence before to extend that recommendation to full-term babies, but Rabe thinks this study should tip the balance in favor of delay.\n\nKjersti Aagaard, vice chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital, is more skeptical. She said the decision about when to clamp should be made between the doctor and parents, depending on the delivery, the health of the baby and the mother's condition.\n\n\"The most important thing for parents to be talking with their provider about is how will we adapt to the delivery as it emerges,\" she said.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Hypothetically, a delay in cord-clamping is something equally available to all those who deliver babies and their patients.

Medications and psychotherapy are the primary treatments. Many older adults prefer psychotherapy to medication for the treatment of anxiety. However, older adults who live in rural areas can face a number of barriers, including living in an area where psychotherapy is not available, so alternate methods of providing treatment could increase utilization, according to the study background.\n\nGretchen A. Brenes, Ph.D., of the Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, N.C., and coauthors compared telephone-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with telephone-delivered nondirective supportive therapy (NST) in a randomized clinical trial of 141 adults 60 or older with generalized anxiety disorder. The participants (70 were assigned to telephone CBT and 71 to telephone NST) were followed up at two months and four months.\n\nTelephone CBT consisted of up to 11 sessions (nine required) and focused on, among other things, anxiety symptom recognition, cognitive restructuring, relaxation, coping statements and problem solving. Telephone NST was 10 sessions where participants discussed their feelings but no direct suggestions for coping were provided.\n\nThe clinical trial demonstrated both treatments reduced symptoms of worry, depression and GAD, but telephone CBT was superior to telephone NST and resulted in a greater reduction of symptoms.\n\nAt four month\u2019s follow-up there was greater decline in worry severity among telephone CBT participants but no significant differences in general anxiety symptoms. At four months\u2019 follow-up there also was greater decline in self-reported GAD symptoms and depressive symptoms among participants in the telephone CBT, according to the results.\n\n\u201cTelephone-delivered psychotherapy is one way to overcome some barriers to mental health treatment that rural older adults face,\u201d the study concludes.\n\nThis work was funded by a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health.

And cancer patients may experience low platelet counts and be at risk for a clotting disorder called 'heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.'\" Dr. McBane noted that cancer and cancer treatment can be associated with kidney injury, which can limit the drug's use further. Finally, Dr. McBane says there isn't is a good antidote for this medication should a bleeding problem arise.\n\n\"More recently, a number of new blood thinners called 'direct oral anticoagulants' have become available,\" says Dr. McBane. \"As a class, these drugs have a number of advantages, including oral delivery, lack of interactions with foods or other medications, and the lack of a need for monitoring drug levels.\" He says these qualities make this class of drug much easier to use than the traditional blood thinners. However, it was unclear whether these drugs could be used safely in cancer patients until now.\n\nDr. McBane says quality of life surveys, which were taken monthly throughout the six-month trial, showed that patients markedly preferred oral apixaban over injectable dalteparin. \"We are hopeful that this medication will also improve medication compliance in cancer patients requiring blood thinner therapy.\"\n\nAs a leading institution funded by the National Cancer Institute, Mayo Clinic Cancer Center conducts basic, clinical and population science research, translating discoveries into improved methods for prevention, diagnosis, prognosis and therapy.

The British research found no negative effects of such light drinking on 5-year-olds whose mothers had imbibed while pregnant with them. Indeed, these kindergartners were slightly less likely to have behavioral problems and performed somewhat better on cognitive tests than children whose mothers had abstained. (More on Time.com: 5 Pregnancy Taboos Explained (or Debunked))\n\nBut this does *not* mean that light drinking in pregnancy is good for your baby. When researchers controlled for factors like maternal education and income, which tend to be higher in light drinkers, it significantly reduced the positive effects associated with alcohol. For example, before adjusting for these kinds of differences between the groups, the researchers found that light drinking was connected with 33% lower rates of overall behavior problems in boys \u2014 after the adjustment, that effect fell to 23%.\n\nThe study did find negative effects in children whose mothers drank moderately: this was defined as not having more than 3 to 6 British units of alcohol per week or more than 3 to 5 units on a single occasion. (One British unit of alcohol equals a small glass of wine.) Heavier drinking in pregnancy, not surprisingly, resulted in increased levels of behavior problems and lowered cognitive performance among children.\n\nThe research included 11,513 children participating in a large U.K. study. The authors had earlier published similar results looking at the data for children in the study when they were 3, finding those whose mothers who didn\u2019t drink had slightly more behavior problems and slightly poorer performance on mental tests than kids born to light drinkers; the results also showed increasingly negative effects of alcohol going from moderate to heavy drinking. Other research has repeatedly shown that heavy, binging patterns of consumption are most dangerous to the developing child. (More on Time.com: If I\u2019m Drunk, Then You Stepped On My Toes On Purpose)\n\nInterestingly, the new study parallels the effects of alcohol on health more generally; lighter drinkers tend to do better than teetotalers while the heaviest drinkers do worse. (But see here for coverage of a study that found even heavy drinkers beat abstainers when it comes to mortality in mid- to late life.)\n\nYet previous research in the area of maternal drinking has repeatedly found negative effects from even the lowest levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. This data is notoriously hard to interpret, however, in part because it is based on women\u2019s self-reports: the public health message against drinking during pregnancy has been so widely adopted that women who do drink may significantly underreport their consumption to researchers. If women who say they are drinking at \u201clight\u201d levels are actually drinking at moderately or heavily, that might make the data on light drinking look more dangerous than they are.\n\n\n\nWhatever the case, American health authorities remain united in their advice that no amount of alcohol is safe for the fetus during pregnancy \u2014 and anyone who is familiar with fetal alcohol syndrome knows why. But for those women who drink before finding out they\u2019re pregnant or who have an occasional glass of wine afterward, this study can provide reassurance that very low levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy are unlikely to cause serious problems.\n\nEven More Evidence for the Health Benefits of Drinking\n\nPhotos: What Booze Looks like Under a Microscope", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "This does not seem to apply here.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "A study coordinated by the MUSC Health Weight Management Center shows the scales tipping in Weight Watchers' favor instead of standard care when it comes to helping people with Type 2 diabetes.\n\nPatrick O'Neil, Ph.D., directs the Weight Management Center and led the 16-site study. Results were published November 2 in the Obesity Journal.\n\nWhile the Weight Management Center has a high success rate at helping patients lose weight to fight diabetes, many people with the condition don't live near a specialized program and need help that's readily available. O'Neil said because Weight Watchers has centers all over the country, including sites in small towns with limited or no medical facilities, its program could help meet this need if combined with diabetes-specific counseling.\n\nThat's why he said it was important for MUSC to be involved in the study, which was funded by a grant from the commercial weight loss program, Weight Watchers. Promoting healthy communities is part of MUSC's mission.\n\nThe multi-site study's results were statistically and clinically significant, O'Neil said.\n\n\"The Weight Watchers people were significantly better off than people who received standard care.\" They achieved better control of their blood sugar and lost more weight, he said. They still had diabetes, but many were able to reduce the amount of medication they were taking.\n\nThe study's 563 participants were all overweight or obese and under a doctor's care for uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes. Half got standard care: a session of nutrition counseling with a registered dietitian and written materials. The other half went to Weight Watchers meetings, had access to Weight Watchers' online materials and had two phone consultations and follow-up email contact with certified diabetes educators who told them how to modify the Weight Watchers plan to help with their diabetes.\n\nParticipants had four follow-up visits related to the study and continued to see their regular doctors for medical management of their diabetes.\n\nAfter a year, people in the Weight Watchers group had an average weight loss of about 4 percent of their starting weight, compared to 2 percent for the standard care group. The Weight Watchers group also had a bigger improvement in a measure of long-term control of their blood sugar, which can reduce the risk for serious problems related to Type 2 diabetes. Left uncontrolled, the condition can damage blood vessels and nerves, putting people at risk of having a heart attack or stroke. It can also cause eye problems, kidney damage and even lead to amputations.\n\u2022 Not getting enough exercise\n\nCertain racial and ethnic groups are more at risk, including African-Americans and Hispanics. Unlike Type 1 diabetes, which is caused by an immune reaction, Type 2 diabetes develops over the course of years. So incremental improvements such as the ones seen in the MUSC-led study are important.\n\n\"It wasn't a huge, overwhelming difference,\" O'Neil said. \"But it was scalable, meaning it could be applied to the whole population.\"\n\nThe whole population of people with Type 2 diabetes includes more than 20 million Americans. It's by far the more common form of diabetes and can lead to about $85,000 in medical costs.\n\nDiabetes is a growing problem. O'Neil said the rate jumped from about 9 percent to 12 percent between 2002 and 2012. Weight loss is seen as a good way to slow its progression.\n\nThe MUSC Health Weight Management Center takes a scientific approach to weight loss, focusing on changes in activity levels, behavior, thinking, diet and support systems. O'Neil said it's important to help people, not blame them.\n\nThe Weight Watchers study is new evidence of what that help might include when it comes to a side effect of weight gain: Type 2 diabetes. \"You do have some power and control,\" he said. \"You can lose some weight and lower your blood sugar - and may even be able to change your medications.

To alleviate symptoms, steam inhalation and nasal irrigation are widely suggested as an alternative to common treatment with antibiotics, which are often not effective and contribute to antibiotic resistance.\n\nResearchers from the United Kingdom conducted a randomized controlled trial on the effectiveness of advice from primary care physicians to use nasal irrigation and/or steam inhalation for chronic sinusitis. The study involved 871 patients from 72 primary care practices in England who were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 advice strategies: usual care, daily nasal and saline irrigation supported by a demonstration video, daily steam inhalation, or combined treatment with both interventions.\n\n\"We have found that even a very brief intervention of a video showing patients how to use saline nasal irrigation can improve symptoms, help people feel they do not need to see the doctor to manage the problem, and reduce the amount of over-the-counter medication they need to use,\" said Dr. Paul Little, Primary Care and Population Sciences Unit, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.\n\nPatients who were instructed to use nasal irrigation showed improvement at 3 and 6 months, as measured by the Rhinosinusitis Disability Index.

One expert, Dr. Dale Bredesen, a professor at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and a professor at the Easton Laboratories for Neurodegenerative Disease Research at UCLA, thinks he might have found a way to reverse memory loss, a hallmark of the disease.\n\nIn a study published in the journal Aging, Bredesen and colleagues showed how 10 patients who were experiencing age-related memory decline showed brain scan improvements after following an approach called metabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration (MEND), a 36-point individualized regimen of diet, exercise, brain stimulation, sleep improvements, medication and vitamins and other specific protocols for five to 24 months.\n\nFor example, an MRI of one patient showed hippocampal volume at the 17th percentile for his age range prior to MEND. (The hippocampus is a brain area critical for learning and memory that shrinks in Alzheimer's patients.) After 10 months of following the prescribed protocol, his hippocampal volume increased to the 75th percentile.\n\nThe study noted that some of the patients who had to quit working as a result of their memory decline, were able to return to work after adopting MEND and participants who were struggling at their jobs reported an improvement in job performance.\n\n\"Lives have been dramatically impacted,\" Bredesen told CBS News. \"I'm enthusiastic about that and continue to evolve the protocol.\"\n\nJames E. Galvin, M.D., M.P.H., a professor of clinical biomedical science at FAU's Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine and a professor in the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing, who was not involved in the study, agreed that personalized approaches such as the MEND protocol are the types of approaches needed for this disease going forward. \"It's important to be excited about this approach,\" he told CBS News. However, Galvin cautioned, \"I'm not sure about the method.\"\n\nThe MEND protocol, outlined in a 2014 study in the journal Aging, calls for interventions to treat conditions that could be associated with Alzheimer's such as inflammation, stress and diabetes. However, MEND also requires the use of supplements which are not well studied and do not require FDA approval.\n\n\"Not all things from the approach have a lot of scientific support behind them,\" Galvin told CBS News.\n\nBut Bredesen believes that the only way to treat Alzheimer's is to treat all of the underlying problems, which may require intervention with supplements. \"Nutrition, exercise, sleep, stress reduction -- these are all critical pieces of this,\" he told CBS News. \"It's about optimizing biochemistry for your genetics, whatever it takes.\"\n\nBut even if MEND is effective, the program is complex and difficult to follow. A Buck Institute press release on the study stated: \"None of the patients were able to stick to the entire protocol. The significant diet and lifestyle changes, and multiple pills required each day, were the two most common complaints.\"\n\nBredesen said that to simplify the program, they are connecting patients with health coaches. \"We're trying to make it simpler, but we don't want to lose the efficacy,\" he said.\n\nBredesen noted, too, that the MEND protocol was suitable for patients in the early stages of Alzheimer's. One participant from the 2014 study, who had been diagnosed with late-stage Alzheimer's, did not show improvements with the protocol.\n\n\"If you told me that your mother is 86 and living in a home, I would say that I'd want to treat you,\" he said. \"It's about prevention.\"\n\nBredesen said that his team has a couple of larger trials planned to confirm or refute the results in the current study and to address key questions about how long results can be maintained and how late in the course of cognitive decline reversal is possible.\n\nGalvin agrees that more research is necessary before any conclusive results can be reported. \"This is moving in the right direction,\" he told CBS News. \"These anecdotal case reports provide a nice point to start a discussion.\"", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story quotes Bredesen saying \u201chis team has a couple of larger trials planned to confirm or refute the results in the current study and to address key questions about how long results can be maintained and how late in the course of cognitive decline reversal is possible.\u201d\nBut the story could have served readers better if it had pressed Bredesen for specifics about when these trials might occur.

But it wasn't his own condition that motivated him, it was looking into the hollow eyes of sick children on the cancer ward at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.\n\n\"I saw the smiles of youth and saw their spirits were broken. And you could see that they were sort of asking, 'Why can't they do something for me?'\" Kanzius told Stahl.\n\n\"So they started to haunt you. The children,\" Stahl asked.\n\n\"Their faces. I still remember them holding on their Teddy bears and so forth,\" he replied. \"And shortly after that I started my own chemotherapy, my third round of chemotherapy.\"\n\nKanzius told Stahl the chemotherapy made him very sick and that he couldn't sleep at night. \"And I said, 'There's gotta be a better way to treat cancer.'\"\n\nIt was during one of those sleepless nights that the light bulb went off. When he was young, Kanzius was one of those kids who built radios from scratch, so he knew the hidden power of radio waves. Sick from chemo, he got out of bed, went to the kitchen, and started to build a radio wave machine.\n\n\"Started looking in the cupboard and I saw pie pans and I said, 'These are perfect.

How can you think that you can?'\"\n\nThat's what 60 Minutes wanted to know, so Stahl went to his garage laboratory to find out.\n\nHere's how it works: one box sends radio waves over to the other, creating enough energy to activate gas in a fluorescent light. Kanzius put his hand in the field to demonstrate that radio waves are harmless to humans.\n\n\"So right from the beginning you're trying to show that radio waves could activate gas and not harm the human-anything else,\" Stahl remarked. \"'Cause you're looking for some kind of a treatment with no side effects, that's what's in your head.\"", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The segment makes clear that the technique is not available for human use.

One suggestion is to replace 5% of the flour in pizza dough with dried and granulated seaweed.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of premature death globally. Ironically, many of the pathologies leading to premature death from cardiovascular diseases are not only widespread, but they are preventable.\n\nOne way to prevent cardiovascular diseases is to avoid obesity and eat healthy, leaving the responsibility with the individual consumer.\n\nBut the responsibility should also be shared by society, argues University of Southern Denmark professor of biophysics, Ole G. Mouritsen, who has authored several books on seaweed as food.\n\nProfessor Mouritsen is the co-author of an article in the journal Phycologia reviewing existing knowledge on the health effects of 35 different seaweed species.\n\nIn the article the authors offer suggestions to how both individual consumers and the food industry can use seaweed to make our everyday meals healthier.\n\n\"Certain substances in seaweed may be important for reducing cardiovascular diseases. We think this knowledge should be available for society and also be put to use\", says Mouritsen.\n\nMany seaweed species have a variety of health benefits. They contain, among other things, beneficial proteins, antioxidants, minerals, trace elements, dietary fiber and polyunsaturated fatty acids.\n\nSeaweed's content of potassium salts does not led to high blood pressure - unlike the sodium salts, typically encountered in the processed food.\n\nAn important feature is also that the seaweed has umami - the fifth basic taste, which is known to promote satiety and hence regulate food intake in addition to reduce the craving for salt, sugar and fat.\n\n\"It is difficult to determine how much seaweed a person should consume to benefit from its good qualities. 5-10 grams of dried seaweed per day is my estimate\", says Professor Mouritsen.\n\nHe and the co-authors suggest that seaweed should be added fast food, thus making this type of food healthier. It can even enhance the flavor of the food, they argue. For example, dried and granulated seaweed can replace some of the flour when producing dry pasta, bread, pizza, snack bars, etc.\n\nIt is also possible to add seaweed to meat products and thereby provide the consumer with an increased intake of dietary fiber and antioxidants - or maybe the aim is lower cholesterol levels.\n\nIn the article Professor Mouritsen and his co-authors describe a study in which a group of overweight but otherwise healthy men were asked to taste bread with added dried seaweed from the species Ascophyllum nosodum. The men's reaction was that the bread tasted acceptable as long as the seaweed content was kept under 4%.\n\nBy eating bread containing 4% of dried seaweed the overweight men ingested more dietary fiber (4.5 g more fiber per. 100 g) than when they ate the control whole-meal bread. Another effect was that they consumed 16.4% less energy in the 24 hour period after eating the seaweed enriched bread.\n\n\"We know that many people have difficulty distinguishing between healthy and unhealthy food. By adding seaweed to processed foods we can make food healthier. In many cases we also get tastier food, and it may also help reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases\", the authors believe.\n\u2022 Seaweed contains only few calories, but is still rich in rich in essential amino acids, dietary fibers, minerals, trace elements, vitamins and polyunsaturated fats.\n\u2022 You can easily add up to 5% dried seaweed to a dough without losing its ability to raise.\n\u2022 Dried seaweed can be stored for months or years without loss of flavor and nutritional value.\n\u2022 Dried seaweed can be added to food as powder, granulate or pieces in pastries, egg dishes, mashed potatoes, dressings, or sprinkled on vegetables or fish dishes.\n\u2022 Powders and granulates can be used as a salt substitute.\n\u2022 Hijiki contains arsenic, which is carcinogenic and therefore some national food authorities recommend that you do not eat it. Despite these warnings, you can buy dried hijiki in many stores.\n\u2022 Some species may contain large amounts of iodine.\n\u2022 Never eat seaweed that is washed up on the beach.\n\nContact Professor Ole G.

These include medical history and symptoms, and a physical exam in which a doctor will listen to a patient's heart and lung sounds, and check ankles, feet, legs and abdomen for signs of fluid buildup. Blood tests and an electrocardiogram can help confirm that heart failure exists.\n\nIn the new study, to gauge how well the noninvasive breath test could identify heart failure, the team collected exhaled breath samples from 41 patients who had been admitted as in-patients to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nOf those, 25 had been admitted with a primary diagnosis of \"acute decompensated heart failure\" while another 16 patients had shown no signs of heart failure but did have other cardiovascular issues. A single breath sample was obtained from each of the patients within 24 hours of admission, as well as from an additional 36 patients with acute decompensated heart failure as an independent point of comparison.\n\nWithin two hours of collection, all the samples were subject to the breath test analysis, which relied upon \"mass spectrometry\" technology to scan the samples for their molecular and chemical compound content. Some of those compounds had been pegged as potential telltale signs of heart failure.\n\nThe result: The breath test correctly identified all the patients with heart failure, clearly distinguishing them from those cardiac cases where heart failure was not an issue.\n\nDr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that if further research were able to establish its effectiveness, a breath-driven tool for identifying heart failure would be a helpful diagnostic innovation -- but more so in a doctor's office or clinic than in the hospital.\n\n\"If it is clear that it is highly reliable and specific and sensitive, then yes, it would be a welcome advance,\" he said. \"But I would say it would be perhaps more helpful for primary care physicians in an outpatient setting, because that is where it's most challenging to identify heart failure. Today a diagnosis in that environment is based on a patient's history and exam, but symptoms for heart failure can easily overlap with a lot of other diagnoses. And the blood work that would be taken in a doctor's office might not come back until the next day, delaying identification,\" he noted.\n\n\"So a breath test would be most useful in that kind of challenging situation,\" Fonarow said. \"But in an emergency room, while there are challenges as well, bedside blood tests are much more readily drawn and quickly analyzed so you can often get the results in minutes. So there may be potentially less of a role for a breath test in that kind of setting.\"\n\nStudy author Dweik added that the test is \"theoretically cheap. But of course we're still early in the process of exploring its potential. This study is really a proof of concept.

They are helping their brains. The brain shrinks as part of aging, but with this program we appear to have stopped that shrinkage and are reversing part of the aging process.\"\n\nFor the study, Carlson and her colleagues randomized 111 men and women to either participate in the Experience Corps (58) or not (53). They took MRI scans of their brains at enrollment and then again after 12 and 24 months. They also conducted memory tests. Participants were an average of 67.2 years old, predominantly African-American, were in good health, came from neighborhoods with low socioeconomic status and had some college education.\n\nThe control arm of the study, those not involved in Experience Corps, exhibited age-related shrinkage in brain volumes. Typically, annual rates of atrophy in adults over age 65 range from .8 percent to two percent. The men who were enrolled in Experience Corps, however, showed a .7 percent to 1.6 percent increase in brain volumes over the course of two years. Though not statistically significant, women appeared to experience small gains, as compared to declines in the control group of one percent over 24 months.\n\nCarlson notes that many cognitive intervention studies last one year or less. One strength of this study, she says, is that the participants were followed for two years, which in this case was long enough to see changes that wouldn't have been detected after just one year.\n\nThe researchers were particularly interested in the results, considering that people with less education and who live in poverty are at greater risk for cognitive decline.\n\nCarlson says it's not entirely clear which elements of Experience Corps account for the improved memory function and increased brain volumes. She says the program increases involvement in so many different kinds of activities that retired people may not have engaged in otherwise. Participants need to get out of bed, walk to the bus, and walk up and down stairs inside the schools. They work in teams. They work with young people. They share their knowledge and know they are doing good in the world. They engage in problem solving and they socialize in ways they wouldn't have if they stayed at home.\n\n\"We're not training them on one skill, like doing crossword puzzles,\" she says. \"We're embedding complexity and novelty into their daily lives, something that tends to disappear once people retire. The same things that benefit us at 5, 10, 25, 35 - contact with others, meaningful work - are certain to benefit us as we age.\"\n\nExperience Corps is a national program, however it can be costly and isn't available everywhere.

This might include reducing blood pressure and inflammation, he added.\n\nPrevious research linked dementia risk with the amount of omega-3 fatty acids in blood plasma, which reflects how much people had eaten in the past few days. But in the current work, researchers could estimate the amount of omega-3s that participants had consumed in the past several months by looking at how much had built up in their red blood cells.\n\n\"This represents their average intake of fatty acids, not just a snapshot,\" Tan said.\n\nThe study, published in the Feb. 28 issue of the journal Neurology, did not prove that omega-3 fatty acids prevent mental decline, merely that there may be an association between consumption of fatty acids and brain health.\n\nFor the study, researchers measured the red blood cell level of fatty acids in 1,575 dementia-free people whose average age was 67. About three months later, participants underwent mental-functioning tests and MRI scans that examined brain size and blood supply in the brain.\n\nThe participants were in the Framingham Offspring Study, which is predominately white. Whether the association would apply to other ethnic and racial groups needs to be explored, the authors said.\n\nThe researchers found that those with the lowest levels of omega-3s had worse scores on tests of visual memory, attention and abstract thinking than people who ranked in the top 75 percent for fatty-acid levels.\n\nAdults in the bottom 25 percent also tended to have smaller brain volume overall. The decrease in brain volume was enough to make their brains appear two years older than those of people in the top three-quarters for fatty-acid levels.\n\nBrain scans also showed signs of less blood supply in the brains of people with the lowest omega-3 levels. This suggests they may play a role in promoting general vascular, or blood vessel, health in the brain, similar to how they are thought to help heart health, rather than acting on just one brain area, Tan said.\n\nThe researchers took into account various health and lifestyle factors, including age, education and body mass index, to explore whether other differences among the people with low levels of omega-3s could help explain their more rapid brain aging.\n\nBut after controlling for those risk factors, \"the difference [in brain aging] is still there so we conclude that omega-3 fatty acids likely explain them,\" Tan said.\n\nTan added, however, that it remains possible that factors they did not control for, such as fruit and vegetable consumption, are really responsible for the brain benefits. Another possibility is that the slight mental decline that the people in the older brain group were experiencing caused them to eat less healthy omega-3-rich foods, instead of vice versa.\n\n\"This is a strengthening of the argument that people with less [omega-3 fatty acids] have higher risk of dementia,\" said Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, associate professor of clinical neurology at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City.\n\nBut questions remain over whether fatty-acid levels really influence changes in brain size, Scarmeas added. A clinical trial comparing high and low intake of omega-3s in relation to brain imaging would help answer those questions, he said.\n\nIn the meantime, fish is \"a good prescription for other things and we have a hint it might be helpful for the brain,\" Scarmeas said.\n\nThat the current study reported a difference in brain health between people with omega-3 fatty-acid levels in the bottom 25 percent and top 75 percent suggests that there is a threshold level of consumption to attain brain gains.\n\nA previous study in which participants filled out food surveys found decreased risk of vascular brain problems among those who ate at least three servings of fish a week.\n\nFind out more about brain health at the Alzheimer's Association.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The availability of fish isn\u2019t in question.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "MONDAY, Nov. 16, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Breast-feeding a premature infant may help reduce the risk of a serious eye problem known as retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), new research suggests.\n\nThe researchers said that when babies were exclusively fed breast milk, the risk of any-stage ROP appeared to drop by about 75 percent. And the risk of severe ROP seemed to be reduced by 90 percent, the researchers added.\n\n\"Human milk feeding potentially plays a strong role in protecting very preterm newborns from any-stage ROP and severe ROP,\" the international team of study authors wrote.\n\nRetinopathy of prematurity causes blood vessels to grow in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue in the back of the eye. When the vessels grow, they can cause the retina to detach, destroying vision, according to the U.S. National Eye Institute.\n\nFor the study, researchers from China, Canada and the United Kingdom reanalyzed the results of five published studies on ROP. The studies included more than 2,200 preterm infants, comparing how often babies had been fed human milk or formula, and whether or not they developed ROP.\n\nHowever, the new analysis only showed an association between breast milk and a reduced risk of ROP. It did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship due to the study's design.\n\nResults of the study were published online Nov. 16 in Pediatrics.\n\nExtremely preterm babies are most at risk of ROP. In the United States, 59 percent of babies born at 22 to 28 weeks have the disorder, said study researcher Dr. Chao Chen, a neonatologist at Children's Hospital of Fudan University, in Shanghai. He added that in China, a previous study showed the incidence of ROP was 50 percent in infants with a birth weight under 1,000 grams (2.2 pounds).\n\nROP \"has become a leading cause of childhood blindness in recent time,\" Chen said. \"In general, there are more ROP cases in developed countries, but more severe cases and higher rates of blindness in developing countries.\"\n\nThe greater incidence of ROP is likely due to the increasing survival rate of very preterm babies in developed countries, according to Chen. In developing countries, preterm babies are less likely to survive. When they do, the screening and treatments are not as good, Chen said, so blindness may be more likely.\n\nBabies in the studies had a range of gestational ages, from 26 to about 30 weeks. Their weights ranged from about 1.7 pounds to about 3 pounds. No information was given about how long the breast-feeding continued.\n\nIn re-evaluating the studies, Chen's team found that breast-feeding in any amount appeared to reduce the risk of ROP. And it appeared that the more breast milk, the better. Exclusive breast-feeding seemed to drop the odds of ROP by 75 percent compared to exclusive formula use. And any breast-feeding appeared to reduce the odds of the serious eye disease by 46 percent, the research showed.\n\nHow might human milk offer protection from the eye disorder? The antioxidants in human milk may help, Chen said. Human milk also has immune-protective properties, the researchers said. Breast-feeding also seems to help prevent two conditions known as sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis that may require oxygen therapy, which has also been linked to a higher risk of ROP, the study authors said.\n\nDr. Adolfo Llanos, a neonatologist at Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami, who was not involved with the new study, said the \"quality of this analysis is very good. It's reassuring to see the benefit we see with breast milk.\"\n\nHe said breast milk may help by reducing inflammation in the body. \"Preemies don't regulate inflammation in their bodies well,\" he said.\n\nLlanos cautioned that the study looked only at a mother's own breast milk, not donor milk, which can be used when the biological mother doesn't have enough of her own breast milk.\n\nThe takeaway from this study, Llanos said, is to breast-feed as long as possible, if possible.\n\nTo learn more about breast-feeding, visit American Academy of Pediatrics.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "We won\u2019t dock points from the story for not discussing the availability of formula and breast milk.

Two arms used 72 healthy volunteers who were either injected with a single dose of the drug in increasing amounts to test for side effects, which is the purpose of a phase one clinical trial. A third arm included 21 people with a family history of high cholesterol, and 30 people with nonfamilial high cholesterol. All of those subjects were also receiving treatment with the statin Lipitor.\n\nA control group of subjects with nonfamilial high cholesterol was treated only with a special diet. None of the subjects who received REGN727 discontinued the study because of adverse effects, and the subjects who received REGN727 had a striking reduction of 60 to 65% in LDL cholesterol, according to Stein.\n\nStein characterized the results of the trial as \u201cpretty dramatic.\u201d\n\nA PCSK9 inhibitor, Stein said, differs from statins \"because it's unlike any other drug.

Soon, we can expect more human trials in which investigators will dissect the properties of different PCSK9 antibodies and assess the effect of these agents.\u201d\n\nHowever, without long-term safety data and evidence that PCSK9 inhibitors truly help prevent heart disease, Young and Fong caution that it will remain unclear how important this class of drugs will be.\n\nThe cost of this drug will also play a role in determining which patients might use it, Fong and Young say.

All the participants had chronic autoimmune inflammatory diseases, which occur when healthy cells are mistaken for infected cells, causing the immune system to attack the body and leading to inflammation.\n\nAnti-cytokine drugs \"dampen down inflammation by blocking the actions of specific inflammatory cytokines ... with 'surgical precision' and are now routinely used for treating patients who respond inadequately to standard treatments for inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and Crohn's disease both in the US and Europe,\" explained Dr. Golam Khandaker, a clinical lecturer in Cambridge's department of psychiatry and lead author of the new study.\n\nUsing data from the 20 studies, Khandaker and his colleagues found that anti-cytokine drugs improved symptoms of depression, regardless of whether they lessened the symptoms of physical illness.\n\n\"The findings suggest that inflammation may contribute to the pathogenesis of depression,\" Khandaker said. The findings also suggest that \"anti-inflammatory drugs may be helpful in treating patients with depression who are chronically inflamed.\"\n\nThe immune system acts like a thermostat, turned down low most of the time but cranked up when we have an infection, according to Khandaker. In some people, the thermostat is always set slightly higher, behaving as if they have a persistent low-level infection.\n\nFor the current report, Khandaker and his colleagues looked at studies of drugs blocking specific cytokines.\n\nKhandaker said that five of the 20 studies focused on one specific cytokine. All five showed the same result, that blocking the action of this cytokine to reduce inflammation lessened symptoms of depression.\n\nTwo clinical trials examined by Khandaker focused on another drug blocking the action of a different cytokine, and both studies showed it improved symptoms of depression.\n\nLooking to the future\n\n\"Evidence at this point suggests that cytokine antagonists -- which are much more specific in their anti-inflammatory effects than drugs like aspirin -- show modest antidepressant effects in individuals with depression and increased inflammation,\" said Raison, who did not participate in in Khandaker's research.\n\nThough it's still too early to prescribe these drugs to depressed patients, Khandaker believes that anti-inflammatory drugs may offer hope to people who find current antidepressants ineffective.\n\n\"We need more studies,\" he said, particularly research involving patients with depression who are inflamed but healthy to investigate the effect of these drugs on depression. Their potential side effects also must be investigated, Khandaker said, adding that \"we and other research groups from both sides of the Atlantic are currently planning and conducting such randomized control trials.\"", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story notes that more research needs to be done before the new anti-inflammatories could be prescribed as a direct therapy for depression, and\u00a0one of the researchers notes that it\u2019s too early to prescribe them for depression.\u00a0We\u00a0also liked that the story mentioned other diseases that are treated by anti-inflammatories.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "WASHINGTON, Sept. 29, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The American College of Radiology (ACR), Society of Breast Imaging (SBI) and major medical organizations experienced in breast cancer care continue to recommend that women start getting annual mammograms at age 40.

It is estimated that the condition affects one in 110 children in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"There is a serious unmet need in the autism world, where diagnosis is currently done by subjective reports, and after the child has missed many developmental milestones,\" said lead researcher Joy Hirsch, a professor of functional neuroradiology, neuroscience and psychology, and director of the Functional MRI Laboratory at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City.\n\n\"It is now possible to develop an objective imaging diagnostic,\" she said. Indeed, the researchers found a difference between autistic brains and typical brains in the level of responsiveness in language areas, Hirsch noted.\n\n\"What we can measure are signals in the brain, in a specific language area, that are depressed in autistic children and normal in typical children,\" she said.\n\nAlthough this study was done with school-aged children and teens, the same test can be done with children as young as 18 months, Hirsch noted. \"We know this technique can be used on young children,\" she said.\n\nThe report was released in the May 31 online edition of Radiology, in advance of publication in the August print issue.\n\nFor the study, 12 children with autism and 15 children without the condition underwent functional MRI (fMRI) exams. Both groups of children ranged in age from 4 to 17 years.\n\nWhile the children were undergoing the fMRI, the researchers played recordings of their parents talking to them and watched for brain activity in areas of the brain responsible for hearing and understanding language.\n\nThe researchers found no differences in the activity in the hearing area of the brain between the two groups. However, in the language comprehension area, there was significantly more activity among typical children than among children with autism, Hirsch's group noted.\n\nTo further test this screening approach, another group of 27 autistic children, aged 5 to 17, underwent fMRI and the researchers were able to identify 26 of them as autistic.\n\nDr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York in Lake Success, said that \"although the investigators did indeed find significant differences on neuroimaging between controls and autistic children, the clinical utility from a diagnostic standpoint is unclear.\"\n\nThere are important limitations to the study, Adesman said.\n\nFor one, this study was done in school-aged children, many of whom were actually teenagers, so it is impossible to know if these differences in neuroimaging would also be found in younger patients, Adesman pointed out.\n\n\"It is during the toddler/preschool years that autism typically presents and needs to be diagnosed,\" he explained.\n\n\"The other major limitation of this study is that the investigators did not look at whether these brain differences are specific to children with autism, or if they would also be seen, for example, in children with language delays who are not autistic,\" Adesman said.\n\nHirsch noted the study is preliminary and, as such, has some limitations. For one, it is not known whether this technique can identify autism across the entire spectrum of the disorder.\n\n\"There are questions about how this varies across the severity of autism. Also, can we distinguish autism from other forms of developmental delay?\" she asked. \"These are things that aren't known.\"\n\nFurther work is needed to refine the test, Hirsch added. \"This is not the diagnostic that you can package and send to all community health centers in the United States. This is an announcement that this can be done,\" she said.\n\nThis test costs no more than a standard MRI, which runs around $1,500, Hirsch noted.\n\nAnother expert, Dr. Robert F. Lopez-Alberola, chief of pediatric neurology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, said that \"it's nice to have an objective measure, but it doesn't really do much.\"\n\nUltimately, he said, \"the diagnosis of autism is a clinical diagnosis. I see this as having more implications for research into the pathophysiology of autism.\"\n\nHowever, if this test could be done in really young children, it might help identify autism so that treatment can begin early, Lopez-Alberola suggested. \"We know the earlier we begin interventions, the greater the likelihood of better outcome,\" he said.\n\n\"Although this technique holds promise for identifying infants at risk for autism, it still needs to be determined whether the atypical patterns of brain activation are specific to autism,\" said Geraldine Dawson, chief science officer for Autism Speaks.\n\n\"It is possible that children who have delayed language but not autism would also show the same pattern. Regardless, this research is promising as a method for identifying young children at risk for autism,\" Dawson said.\n\nFor more on autism, visit the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story makes it clear that using MRIs to diagnose autism is an uNPRoven approach.

The alternative therapy reduced hot flashes by as much as 74% in the study conducted by researchers at Baylor University\u2019s Mind-Body Medicine Research Laboratory and funded by the National Institutes of Health. Only hormone therapy, which many women can\u2019t take or want to avoid, is more effective for treating the most common symptom of menopause, says researcher Gary R. Elkins, PhD. \u201cIf you compare this treatment with off-label use of antidepressants or other non-hormonal therapies, it works as well or better,\u201d he says.\n\nHot flashes are a sudden rush of heat, followed by facial flushing and sweating, often followed by chills and clamminess. The progression is familiar to most women of a certain age. Hot flashes and night sweats are the most common symptoms of menopause, affecting some 80% of women. They are linked to declining estrogen levels, but it remains unclear just why the sudden lack of estrogen sends the body into thermal mayhem, and why some women are more affected than others. Hormone therapy is a very effective treatment for menopause-related hot flashes, but concerns about risks have limited its use among women. \u201cThere is certainly a need for non-pharmacologic treatments for hot flashes and night sweats,\u201d says North American Menopause Society (NAMS) Executive Director Margery Gass, MD.\n\nIn an earlier study, Elkins and his Baylor colleagues showed that hypnosis dramatically reduced hot flash and night sweat frequency in breast cancer patients with treatment-related symptoms. In the newly published study, they set out to determine if the alternative treatment would do the same in women whose symptoms were related to menopause. A total of 187 postmenopausal women who reported having at least seven hot flashes a day, or 50 a week, were recruited for the trial. Half the women were given self-hypnosis training that consisted of five, 45-minute weekly sessions.

The journal is published in partnership with Wolters Kluwer.\n\n\"In the absence of treatment alternatives, reverse total shoulder arthroplasty [RTSA] is a justifiable treatment for patients with a massive, irreparable rotator cuff tear before the age of 60,\" according to the report by Christian Gerber, MD, of the University of Zurich and colleagues. Despite a substantial risk of complications, most patients are satisfied with the outcomes of RTSA at follow-ups of a decade or longer.\n\nStable Long-Term Results of RTSA in Patients Younger than 60\n\nThe researchers analyzed the long-term outcomes of RTSA in 20 patients, average age 57 years. All had \"massive, irreparable\" tears of the rotator cuff muscles, causing shoulder \"pseudoparalysis,\"with little no ability to lift the arm.\n\nThis group of patients typically gets limited benefit from shoulder replacement with conventional implants, which rely on the rotator cuff muscles to provide shoulder movement. The RTSA technique--using an implant in which the natural locations of the shoulder \"ball and socket\" are reversed--uses other muscles to move the shoulder, providing an alternative when the rotator cuff is severely damaged or destroyed.\n\nWhen first introduced, RTSA was performed mainly in elderly patients who placed low demands on the shoulder. With refinements in technique and components in more recent years, the procedure has been used in younger, more active patients. But there are concerns about how well the results of RTSA will hold up over time in this group of patients.\n\nThe new study focused on long-term outcomes of RTSA in patients under age 60. The patients underwent follow-up examination between eight and 19 years after surgery (average 11.7 years). Three patients had RTSA in both shoulders, for a total of 23 procedures.\n\nCompared to their preoperative status, most patients had substantial long-term improvement after RTSA. The average Constant score--a standard assessment accounting for shoulder motion, strength, daily activities, and pain--at the time of final-follow-up improved from 24 to 59 (out of a possible 100).\n\nPatients' ratings of \"subjective shoulder value\" improved from 20 percent to 71 percent (compared to 100 percent for a normal shoulder). Shoulder movement and strength increased, while pain decreased. The improvement was similar for patients with and without prior shoulder surgery.\n\nHowever, complications occurred in 39 percent of the shoulders. Further surgery was required in six shoulders; in two cases, the RTSA procedure was considered a failure.\n\nWhen complications occurred, long-term shoulder functioning was not as good but even with the high complication rate, 72 percent of patients rated their satisfaction level as excellent or good.\n\nThe results alleviate concerns that the clinical benefits of RTSA might not hold up over time in younger, more active patients. Despite its high complication rate, Dr. Gerber and colleagues conclude that RTSA \"provides substantial and lasting improvement\" in shoulder function and pain, in a group of patients with limited treatment options.\n\nClick here to read \"Reverse Total Shoulder Arthroplasty for Massive, Irreparable Rotator Cuff Tears Before the Age of 60 Years: Long-Term Results.\"\n\nAbout The Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery\n\nThe Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery (JBJS) has been the most valued source of information for orthopaedic surgeons and researchers for over 125 years and is the gold standard in peer-reviewed scientific information in the field.

She roamed from Chinatown to the Upper East Side, went sightseeing in Central Park and painted the town with her husband of 33 years, their two 20-something children and assorted friends.\n\nOne evening, they found themselves at Del Posto, a chic Italian restaurant. Glancing at her watch, over the sparkle of conversation, wine glasses and half-eaten dessert, Gilbert marveled at the time: just a few minutes to midnight.\n\n\"It was awfully late for me,\" she laughed as she told the story. \"It was just a great moment to know that I was holding up enough to be there, to feel great and make memories.\"\n\nLate-night hours, any hours, are especially precious to Gilbert, who could have been forgiven for feeling just a bit weary. For 15 years, she's been fighting breast cancer.\n\nAfter years of ups and downs, Gilbert is doing well and gives most of the credit to her most recent medicine: bevacizumab, better known by its brand name, Avastin. But gratitude is tinged with worry, because the Food and Drug Administration is considering the unusual step of revoking its approval of Avastin as a treatment for metastatic breast cancer.\n\n\"It's disheartening, and it's a scary thought,\" says Gilbert. \"Until just recently, I didn't know it was so precarious.\"\n\nAvastin, which works by cutting off a tumor's blood supply, was first approved as a cancer treatment in 2004 as a therapy for colon cancer. Since then, it has also been approved as a treatment for certain types of lung, kidney and brain cancer.\n\nIn 2008, the FDA granted Avastin what's known as accelerated approval as a therapy for metastatic breast cancer. The move was based on preliminary studies that found the drug increased the time that patients went without symptoms getting worse. As a condition of the approval, the company that makes Avastin -- Genentech -- agreed to conduct more extensive research.\n\nThe results of those two larger trials, known as RIBBON-1 and AVADO, were made public this year, and to some, they were disappointing. In RIBBON-1, time without symptoms getting worse, known as progression-free survival, or PFS, improved by less than three months.\n\nIn AVADO, it improved by just 24 days. In neither study did patients actually live longer, and there was a high rate of side effects, including high blood pressure and internal bleeding.\n\nIn July, an FDA advisory panel voted 12-1 to recommend revoking the preliminary approval. The FDA promises a final decision by September 17.\n\nGilbert had just passed her 40th birthday when she felt a lump in her breast. It was cancer.\n\nShe had it removed, went through a round of radiation and chemotherapy, and was symptom-free for the next nine years.\n\n\"I almost describe it as the little c,\" is how she tells it today. \"When I got the recurrence, it was the Big C. It was a real surprise when it came back again.\"\n\nThis time, the signal was pain underneath her armpit. Tests revealed several small tumors in the bone.\n\nDoctors told Gilbert she'd be lucky to be alive in five years, but with chemotherapy and radiation, she fought off the cancer, again. A year later, she watched her daughter Neely perform her senior dance recital, and not long after, walk across the stage to collect her high school diploma.\n\n\"All those things you take for granted,\" Gilbert says. \"I was just so blessed to see her graduate.\"\n\nBut chemotherapy took a toll. At one point, Gilbert was hospitalized several days with a low white blood cell count and high fevers.\n\nA few years later, she felt chest pains, and doctors thought she was having a heart attack. As it turned out, Gilbert had no heart damage, but there were days she was so exhausted she couldn't leave the house.\n\nLate last spring, tests at Duke University found signs of cancer in her liver. Dr. Kimberly Blackwell, a breast cancer specialist at Duke, put her on Avastin, along with Navelbine, another chemotherapy drug. Gilbert says the combination stopped her illness in its tracks.\n\nBecause Avastin is approved to treat other cancers, losing the breast cancer indication would not, technically, remove it from a doctor's toolkit. But here's the catch: Avastin costs more than $8,000 a month. At that price, insurance coverage is crucial, and patients and doctors fear that an FDA reversal will lead to most insurers no longer signing the checks.\n\nSusan Pisano, a spokeswoman for the Association of Health Insurance Plans, the largest trade group, said insurers would wait for guidance from the FDA, but adds, \"If the FDA pulls back its approval for this particular indication, it would trigger a review of plan policies. Policies get reviewed whenever there is additional information.\"\n\nThe issue has split advocates for breast cancer patients. Susan G. Komen For the Cure, the largest group, issued a statement in support of Avastin and has helped to circulate a petition asking that it still be made available. But Fran Visco of the National Breast Cancer Coalition says Avastin should not have been approved in the first place.\n\n\"There was a delay in progression of the tumor, but it had no effect on quality of life, or survival,\" Visco says. \"I favor a strong FDA. We need some oversight body to say whether something is effective. You can't rely on industry to do that, or individual physicians.\"\n\nVisco says the new studies on Avastin, AVADO and RIBBON-1, should settle the issue.\n\n\"It's got no impact on survival, and there are troubling side effects. We're supposed to be excited about a delay in tumor progression, for a month? That's sad.\"\n\nBut Blackwell, the Duke oncologist, says the medicine can be used safely as long as patients are carefully monitored. Marcia Gilbert has had no significant side effects since starting on Avastin. If it's not available, Blackwell says, \"I'm going to have to give older drugs with the exact same toxicity. And they've never been shown to improve overall survival, either.\"\n\nBlackwell says the FDA risks setting the bar too high. \"If the [Avastin] label is not upheld, it sets a new standard. We're not going to see another first-line drug for another 10 years, at least.\"\n\nAnother breast cancer specialist, Dr. Edith Perez, deputy director of the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center in Jacksonville, Florida, says many chemotherapy drugs, such as Gemzar -- which is substantially less expensive than Avastin -- have previously been approved without showing they can lengthen survival.\n\nThe issue has been taken up by critics of the health care overhaul signed into law last year. In late July, Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, wrote a letter to the FDA saying that there are no new safety concerns and that \"the [FDA advisory] committee's concerns appear to have been based on cost-effectiveness.\" Vitter went on to say that removing the breast cancer indication would be \"cost-rationing.\"\n\nThe FDA says it does not consider cost when evaluating the safety or effectiveness of a drug. But some physicians, including Perez, say the issue is getting harder to ignore. In cancer care, many drugs are used \"off-label,\" for therapies beyond those formally reviewed by the FDA.\n\n\"When they're less expensive, those drugs get approved by insurers,\" Perez says. When they cost more, \"I'm spending more and more time justifying even treatments that do have regulatory approval.\"\n\nIn some states, insurers may not have the last word. Gilbert has a policy from Blue Cross/Blue Shield of North Carolina. According to Dr. John Fong, the company's vice president and senior medical director, a state law requires that insurers pay for cancer treatment that is listed in certain catalogs of acceptable treatments, compiled by government agencies or professional organizations.\n\nOf course, given the debate over Avastin, those lists could become another source of controversy.\n\nAsked whether she has a Plan B, if insurance no longer pays for Avastin, Gilbert's voice gets a little quiet. \"I've learned with cancer to take it one day at a time, and not look too far ahead. I'm not going to think about it until I have to.\"\n\nThe morning after her midnight meal, Gilbert was on the pavement again, window-shopping with daughter Neely in Soho and Chinatown. Gilbert glows when she talks about the adventure.\n\n\"Years ago, on some of the different chemos, I wouldn't have had the energy to spend a weekend there.

It is already well-established that the benefit of clot removal declines each hour during the first 6 hours after symptoms are detected.\n\nIn the current analysis of treatment between 6 and 24 hours after symptoms were observed, or after the person was last seen to be well, researchers found:\n\u2022 each 1-hour delay reduces the chance of recovery with minimal or no disability by 11 percent; and\n\u2022 treatment remains beneficial through 24 hours, with patients who had their clots removed being 35.5 percent more likely to have minimal or no disability 90 days later, but the overall effect of treatment declines with time.\n\nThe current results demonstrate the importance of prompt imaging and treatment of patients with clot-caused stroke, even in those who wake up having experienced a stroke or who for other reasons are not identified in the first few hours after the onset of symptoms.\n\u2022 Available downloadable B-roll, animation and images to this news tip are on the right column of the tip link https:/\n\u2022 For more news at AHA International Stroke Conference 2018, follow us on Twitter @HeartNews #ISC18.\n\nStatements and conclusions of study authors that are presented at American Heart Association scientific meetings are solely those of the study authors and do not necessarily reflect association policy or position.

And they got a tiny hint that they just may help.\n\nThe team at Stanford University found that infusions of plasma from healthy young men didn\u2019t hurt the 18 Alzheimer\u2019s patients who got them. And a few of the patients seemed to do a little better in the skills of everyday living, although memory and thinking skills were not affected.\n\nThis does not mean that blood transfusions could treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease, researchers cautioned. The study is a very long way from showing that. But it does show it\u2019s worth going forward with more tests, said Dr. Sharon Sha, who ran the test program at Stanford.\n\n\u201cAlthough it\u2019s very exciting, it is very early days,\u201d added Sha.\n\n\u201cWe need to do the next steps to understand what is in the young plasma.\u201d\n\nPlasma is the liquid part of blood, with the red cells and immune cells removed.\n\nThe researchers were working off earlier studies from the lab of Tony Wyss-Coray at Stanford, who found that infusing young human plasma into old mice seemed to perk them up. The work made headlines and launched a company, Alkahest, that\u2019s working to develop young human plasma into treatments for aging-related diseases.\n\nAlkahest plans to move forward with formal clinical trials in 40 volunteers next year, said Joe McCracken, vice president for development at the company.\n\n\"We do have a study with what we think is a commercially viable product that will start early next year,\" McCracken said.\n\nStanford was doing what\u2019s called a proof of concept trial, just to check the safety of the treatment, in 18 volunteers with moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nAt first they did what\u2019s called a blinded trial --- treating half the patients with real plasma, and giving half the patients a sham infusion, with no one knowing which patient got the real treatment. Then they swapped the two sides.\n\nLater, because it was taking so much time and effort, they cut the trial to just nine people and all nine knew they were getting the real thing \u2013 a unit of plasma, once a week for a month, from healthy young men under the age of 30.\n\nThere was no measurable effect on memory or thinking, the team told the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer\u2019s Disease conference in Boston. But Sha said on two measurements of function there was a difference in answers the caregivers gave on a questionnaire.\n\n\u201cAnecdotally, when I saw these patients and caregivers, those that did say they had an improvement\u2026they might have said things like \u2018they are more engaged\u2019, \u2018they are participating on conversations more\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean there really was an effect.

The study was published in Nature's Scientific Reports.\n\nCassandra Quave, an Emory University scientist who studies how indigenous people use plants in healing practices, said researchers pulled apart the chemical ingredients of the berries and tested them in mice infected with these superbug strains. The mice got injections containing the bacteria with or without the plant extracts. Those that didn't receive the extracts developed skin lesions. But in the other mice, the extracts -- a mixture of 27 chemicals -- prevented skin lesions from forming.\n\nInstead of destroying the bacteria, the ingredients in the fruit weakened the bacteria by preventing them from producing the toxins it uses as weapons to damage tissue. The extracts from the fruit repress a gene that allows the bacterial cells to communicate with one another.\n\n\u201cIt weakens the bacteria so the mouse\u2019s own defenses work better\u201d to clear the infection, she said. The plant extracts didn't harm the skin tissues or the normal, healthy bacteria found on skin.\n\nThe discovery may hold the potential for new ways to treat and prevent antimicrobial-resistant infections, an enormous global problem that was the focus of a rare high-level United Nations summit last fall.\n\nMRSA has become a serious threat to human health; in 2011, it was responsible for more than 80,000 invasive infections and more than 11,000 deaths in the United States, according to federal statistics.\n\nAntimicrobial resistance refers to infections that have evolved the ability to withstand drugs that ought to stop them. The medicines include antibiotics, which act on bacteria, as well as drugs to fight fungal, viral or parasitic infections. Fighting bacteria with drugs designed to kill them helps fuel the problem of antibiotic resistance if stronger bacteria can survive and evolve to become \u201csuperbugs.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut instead of always setting a bomb off to kill an infection, there are situations where using an anti-virulence method may be just as effective, while also helping to restore balance to the health of the patient,\u201d said Quave.\n\nPlants have been used repeatedly in traditional medicine over the centuries, and knowledge about their use is passed down from generation to generation, which points to their efficacy, she said.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t save that knowledge over centuries\u201d if something doesn\u2019t work, she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to answer the question: Does this work against bacteria, and how does it work, and is it safe to use?\u201d\n\nThe Brazilian peppertree, a shrubby tree native to South America, is an invasive species throughout the southern United States, particularly in Florida, where it\u2019s sometimes called the Florida holly or broad-leaf peppertree, and is considered a noxious weed. The woody plant has long been a staple in Brazilian traditional medicine. Its leaves and bark are used to treat wounds, ulcers, burns and skin infections, Quave said.\n\nLess is known about the plant\u2019s fruit, which was used traditionally as topical poultices for infected wounds and ulcers.\n\nFrom an ecological standpoint, Quave said, it makes sense that invasive weeds have a chemical advantage that may help protect them from diseases so they can spread more easily in a new environment.\n\nBut she said the average person shouldn\u2019t try to use the weed to make their own medicine. \u201cNot everything that is natural is safe,\u201d she said.\n\nHer lab at Emory is doing additional research to confirm the safest and most effective way of using the plant extract.

Previous research had indicated people with high homocysteine levels were at greater risk.\n\nAlthough the new studies did show that the vitamins cut homocysteine levels, that did not translate into a reduction in the risk for heart attacks or strokes.\n\nIn the first study, Eva Lonn of McMaster University in Canada and her colleagues gave 5,522 Americans and Canadians who had heart disease or diabetes either the supplements or a placebo for five years. Although homocysteine levels among those taking the supplements fell, they were no less likely to die from a heart attack or stroke, the researchers found.\n\nIn the second study, Kaare Harald Bonaa of the University of Tromso in Norway and colleagues researchers gave 3,749 patients who had had a heart attack within the previous week the vitamins or a placebo for more than three years on average. Again, while those receiving the supplements had lower homocysteine levels, they were no less likely to have another heart attack or a stroke, or to die from heart disease.\n\nThe studies, released early by the New England Journal of Medicine to coincide with their presentation at an American College of Cardiology meeting in Atlanta, confirm the results of another large study that was published in 2004 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\n\"The consistency among the results lead to the unequivocal conclusion that there is no clinical benefit of the use of folic acid and vitamin B12 (with or without the addition of vitamin B6) in patients\" with heart disease, wrote Joseph Loscalzo of the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston in an editorial that will be published with the studies.\n\nThe Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade group representing dietary supplement makers, said the findings did not rule out the possibility that the vitamins may reduce the risk for heart disease among healthy people.\n\n\"These studies did not test whether B vitamins used by healthy people can help keep them healthy. Instead, they looked at whether B vitamins can treat or reverse heart disease in people who already have it. Vitamins should not be expected to perform like drugs -- their greatest promise is in prevention,\" said Annette Dickinson in a written statement.\n\nKilmer McCully of the V.A. Boston Healthcare System in West Roxbury, who proposed the homocysteine theory, agreed, adding that more research is needed to understand the exact role of the amino acid in heart disease.\n\n\"You really can't deny that homocysteine is involved in the disease process,\" McCully said in a telephone interview. \"There are hundreds, if not thousands, of papers showing that.\"\n\nBut Steven E. Nissen, president of the American College of Cardiology, said the findings should end debate about the theory, which had already lost credibility among many scientists. \"The homocysteine theory really isn't getting much attention anymore,\" he said.\n\nThe findings follow a number of disappointing studies testing vitamins and other dietary supplements for health reasons. Recent studies have failed to find a clear benefit for glucosamine and chondroitin for arthritis, saw palmetto for prostate problems and echinacea for the common cold.\n\nAnother study presented at the cardiology meeting did surprise researchers when it did not find any benefit to combining the blood-thinner Plavix with aspirin for preventing heart attacks, strokes or deaths in heart patients.

Even the IUD can't stay in place for more than 10 years.\n\nThe only once-and-be-done-with-it option for women has been tubal ligation (\"tying the tubes\") -- surgery that renders a woman sterile. Now a procedure called Essure, recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, gives women an alternative. The nonsurgical approach uses a hysteroscope -- a camera-tipped instrument -- to thread two small wires through the vagina, cervix and uterus and into the fallopian tubes. The wires, composed of polyester fibers and metals, cause inflammation and, over time, scar tissue that blocks the fallopian tubes, preventing sperm from reaching eggs. Women can undergo the procedure in 35 minutes in their doctor's office, under local anesthesia; they are advised to rest for 24 to 48 hours before resuming normal activity. Essure is 99.8 percent effective in preventing pregnancy -- a rate similar to that of tubal ligation, according to the manufacturer, Conceptus Inc. of Mountain View, Calif.\n\nPros and Cons Ellen Whitaker, a gynecologist at the Washington Hospital Center, says \"the biggest advantage\" of Essure is that it involves no incisions or general anesthesia, which both carry risks. By going through the vagina, she says, you \"avoid all the organs in the abdomen.\" In a tubal ligation, she says, \"there's always the possibility of bowel injury, bladder injury . . . which can be very serious.\"\n\nThe biggest drawback, Whitaker says, is the need for X-rays three months after the procedure to confirm the fallopian tubes are blocked. Until then, the patient must use another form of birth control.\n\nSide effects may include pain, cramps and mild bleeding or spotting. There is the risk of infection or a puncture of the vagina or uterus while inserting the hysteroscope. As with tubal ligation, there is also an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy -- a pregnancy that develops outside the uterus.\n\nOne for the Guys Men, too, have an option for a faster, less painful procedure than vasectomy to tie the vas deferens -- the tubes that carry sperm from the testicles to the penis.

There is very little bleeding, and no stitches are needed to close the tiny openings (one on each side).

Not even at the beach in July.\n\nToenail fungus causes nails to become thick, yellow and brittle in a way that looks pretty ugly and can be painful. Sufferers can spend years and hundreds of dollars trying to clear the infection with drugs, topical treatments and home remedies, sometimes to no avail. It tends to be a cosmetic issue for the younger set and a pain issue for older folks.\n\n\u201cThe problem is huge. It is bigger than you can imagine,\u201d says Washington podiatrist Stephen J. Kominsky. \u201cI would say 70 percent of the patients who come into my office have fungal infections on their toenails.\u201d\n\nThere may be hope. Podiatrists have begun using a laser treatment that combats the infection \u2014 or wastes their patients\u2019 money because it doesn\u2019t work, depending on whom you ask.\n\nThe treatment, in which the podiatrist aims a laser beam at the patient\u2019s toenails to kill the organisms that cause the fungus, costs about $1,000 and is not covered by insurance because it is considered an aesthetic procedure. The nails aren\u2019t immediately clear after the treatment, which takes up to an hour; the patient must wait for the fungus-free nails to grow out.\n\nLast year, the Food and Drug Administration cleared the first laser, PinPointe, for \u201ctemporary increase of clear nail\u201d in patients with onychomycosis, the medical term for a fungal infection of the nail. The FDA cleared a second one, GenesisPlus, in April. Practitioners have been using other lasers on toenail fungus since about 2009.\n\nKominsky has treated 400 to 500 patients with the PinPointe laser. Compared with oral medication, he says, \u201cthe odds of success are better with the laser; plus, there\u2019s no side effects.\u201d\n\nThe most common oral treatment, Lamisil, works for about two out of three patients, according to Lamisil\u2019s FDA-approved prescribing information, but it has been associated with rare cases of serious liver problems. Other potential side effects include diarrhea, headache, rashes and changes in taste. According to Lamisil\u2019s manufacturer, Novartis, the relapse rate is 15 percent one year after completing treatment.\n\nIn one small study about laser treatment for toenail fungus, which appeared last year in the Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association, \u201c26 eligible toes (ten mild, seven moderate, and nine severe)\u201d were treated with a laser produced by Nomir Medical Technologies, which is still seeking FDA approval. After six months, 85 percent of the toenails had improved.\n\n\u201cI never use the term \u2018cured\u2019 with toenail fungus,\u201d Kominsky says. \u201cWith a cure, people think there\u2019s no chance for a recurrence. In this case, there is a chance.\u201d\n\nEven John Strisower, the founder of PinPointe USA, says patients should expect at least a minimal reinfection within five years after laser treatment.\n\nResearch done by PinPointe, which is based in Chico, Calif., identified more than 100 organisms, including fungi, yeast, mold and bacteria, that work together to cause toenail fungus.\n\nThere\u2019s no one route of infection, but sources include pedicures and locker room showers. Fungi love moist, dark environments such as wet shoes, Kominsky says, so people such as lifeguards, landscapers and fishermen are particularly susceptible. Shoes are the reason why toenail fungus is much more common than fingernail fungus, which can also occur.\n\nThe elderly are more likely to have toenail fungus than younger people because they have had more years to be exposed to the infection and their immune systems can\u2019t always fight it off, according to Washington podiatrist Lee Firestone. He estimates that about half of people over 70 have toenail fungus.\n\nLast year, Americans spent $354 million on prescription and over-the-counter treatments for toenail fungus, according to IMS Health, a health-care information company.\n\n\u201cI think the laser can improve the appearance of the nail, but it\u2019s only temporary and it needs to be used again and again to maintain that improvement,\u201d says Firestone, who doesn\u2019t use the lasers in his practice. \u201cI\u2019ve had patients come in who have had laser procedures and not seen long-term success.\u201d\n\nFirestone also says that over-the-counter antifungal nail creams and ointments rarely work because they can\u2019t penetrate the nail root. Home remedies such as tea tree oil, bleach and vinegar also don\u2019t work, he says.\n\nYet even a superficial improvement would be an improvement for many.\n\nRichard, a retiree in Fairfax who did not want his full name associated with toenail fungus, got a laser treatment on all 10 toes in April 2010, and he says his nails were fully cleared of the yellowed, thickened look after a year.

Zick, a naturopathic physician and research associate professor at University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor.\n\nThe study, funded by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, was published online Oct. 11 in Cancer Prevention Research.\n\nGinger, an herb, is found in supplements and in many foods such as ginger snaps and Asian dishes. Research has supported its use to treat stomach problems such as nausea and vomiting; the U.S. National Library of Medicine says it's \"likely safe,\" although some people may develop mild side effects.\n\nPrevious research in animals has suggested that ginger can reduce inflammation but isn't potentially toxic to the stomach like aspirin, Zick noted. And scientists have linked chronic inflammation in the gut to colon cancer, suggesting that easing this inflammation could reduce the risk of the disease.\n\nIn the new study, Zick's team randomly assigned 30 people to take pills containing 2 grams of ground ginger root extract or a \"dummy\" placebo pill each day for 28 days. They measured the level of inflammation in the participants' intestines before and after the test period.\n\nThe amount of ginger in the pills is equivalent to 20 grams of raw ginger root, the authors said. That is probably well beyond what most people would eat in their regular diet, Zick noted. As for cost, she said that a month's supply of similar ginger supplements typically runs about $10 to $30.\n\nThe researchers found that the level of inflammation in the subjects who took the ginger pills fell by an average of 28 percent, while staying about the same in those who took the placebo.\n\nIf more funding becomes available, the researchers hope to launch a larger study, Zick said.

The randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study in 121 patients showed that MM36 demonstrates a statistically significant effect on the primary endpoints versus vehicle as measured by improvement in IGA score (Investigators Global Assessment) and percentage change in EASI score (Eczema Area and Severity Index). The mean percentage improvement in baseline EASI score was notable very early at week 1 (31.4% vs. 6% for vehicle; p=.0005) and at week 2 (39.0% vs. 3% for vehicle; p=.0001). These effects were sustained through week 8 of the study. MM36 was also associated with improvement in patient-reported outcomes, most notably rapid and sustained itch relief, with Visual Analog Scale scores showing improvement from moderate to mild within the first week (36.4% mean change; p=.0011).\n\nMM36, a PDE4 inhibitor, reduces inflammation in affected skin by inhibiting production of cytokines and chemical mediators that are believed to cause the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis. In particular, MM36 exhibits highly selective inhibitory activity against PDE4 subtype B, an enzyme that may play a significant role in inflammation. MM36 is expected to be the 2nd topical PDE4 inhibitor in the market after the potential approval of Anacor Pharmaceuticals' crisaborole product.\n\n\"The results of the Phase 2 study suggest that MM36 represents a potentially safe, effective and well-tolerated non-steroidal treatment for mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis,\" said Linda Stein Gold, MD, director of clinical research, Department of Dermatology at Henry Ford Hospital and co-author of the article. \"Based on the results of this study, it appears that MM36 could address an important unmet need in dermatology.\"\n\n\"We are pleased that JAAD, the most respected peer-reviewed journal in dermatology, published the Phase 2 results,\" said Bradley Glassman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Medimetriks. \"We believe these Phase 2 results demonstrate compelling evidence of MM36's capacity to be a leading topical PDE4 inhibitor and are aggressively developing MM36 for atopic dermatitis in the US. Atopic Dermatitis patients have few treatment options and Medimetriks is dedicated to addressing this important unmet need.\"\n\nThe JAAD article discussing the Phase 2 results can be found by visiting www.jaad.org.\n\nAtopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by red, swollen and cracked skin with intense itching. The onset of AD occurs most commonly between 3 and 6 months of age, with approximately 60% of patients developing the condition in the first year of life and 90% by 5 years of age. The majority of affected individuals have resolution of disease during childhood, although 10% to 30% of patients maintain the condition throughout their lives. A small percentage of the population develops first symptoms as adults. It has been estimated that approximately 18 million people are living with AD in the U.S. and this disease accounts for up to 20% of patient visits to dermatology offices.\n\nCurrent treatments for atopic dermatitis include topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors. Topical steroids are typically used as first line therapies and are effective anti-inflammatory agents. However, topical steroids may be associated with local and systemic side effects when used for extended periods of time, including skin atrophy, acne and telangiectasias locally, and HPA axis suppression systemically. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) are recommended as second-line treatment for people with atopic dermatitis who are at risk of steroid-related side effects. TCIs carry boxed warnings about a possible association with skin malignancies and lymphoma, although studies have not demonstrated a clear link. Their use can be limited by local adverse reactions such as burning and stinging.\n\nAbout MM36\n\nMedimetriks has sole, exclusive US rights to MM36. Discovered by Otsuka, MM36 is an investigational non-steroidal topical anti-inflammatory PDE-4 inhibitor in development for the potential treatment of atopic dermatitis. MM36 is hypothesized to exert anti-inflammatory action by inhibiting the production of cytokines and chemical mediators thought to cause the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis. In particular, MM36 exhibits highly selective inhibitory activity against PDE4 subtype B, which is an enzyme that may play a significant role in inflammation.\n\nOtsuka Pharmaceutical is a global healthcare company with the corporate philosophy: \"Otsuka \u2013 people creating new products for better health worldwide.\" Otsuka researches, develops, manufactures and markets innovative and original products, with a focus on pharmaceutical products for the treatment of diseases and nutraceutical products for the maintenance of everyday health.\n\nIn pharmaceuticals, Otsuka is a leader in the challenging area of mental health and also has research programs on several under-addressed diseases including tuberculosis, a significant global public health issue.

On another night, the windows and door to the room were kept closed. In the meantime, Mishra and colleagues monitored carbon dioxide levels, temperature, background noise and humidity. The study participants were asked not to drink alcoholic beverages or caffeinated drinks, which could influence sleep. They each slept alone, and the bedroom layout with furniture arrangement was kept consistent.\n\nFor measuring sleep quality, participants wore an armband that measures skin temperature, heat flux, bed temperature and skin moisture levels. They also wore a sensor that tracked their movements at night, including indications of restlessness.\n\nClosed environments tended to have less background noise \u2013 but they also had significantly higher carbon dioxide levels, which indicated lower ventilation levels.\n\nOpen conditions were slightly cooler than closed, although humidity levels were similar across settings, according to the report in the journal Indoor Air.\n\nNotably, carbon dioxide levels were lower when windows or doors were open.\n\nOverall, skin temperature and the bed temperature were higher in closed conditions than open conditions.

Rather than prepping patients with iodine-alcohol \u2014 a common antiseptic combination in C-sections \u2014 the research indicates that chlorhexidine-alcohol is significantly more effective. The researchers argue that the evidence is strong enough to change standard skin-prep practices for C-sections.\n\nThe study appears online Feb. 4 in The New England Journal of Medicine and coincides with a presentation at the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine\u2019s Annual Meeting in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest complications of surgery, and of C-sections in particular, is infection,\u201d said first author Methodius G. Tuuli, MD, assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology. \u201cFor a new mother who needs to care for her baby \u2014 which is stressful even when all things are equal \u2014 having an infection can really impair her ability to do that. We are very interested in clarifying the best ways to prevent these infections, reducing the burden on the patients, on their infants and on the health-care system as a whole.\u201d\n\nAn estimated 1.3 million women in the U.S. delivered their babies by C-section in 2013, with surgical-site infections complicating 5 to 12 percent of those deliveries. The average cost of treating those cesarean-related infections in the hospital is $3,500 and may be much higher for severe infections.\n\nThe research shows that patients in the chlorhexidine-alcohol group developed significantly fewer infections than patients in the iodine-alcohol group. Those who received the chlorhexidine-alcohol combination had a 4 percent infection rate, which is nearly half that of the patients who received the iodine-alcohol combination \u2014 7.3 percent.\n\nThe clinical trial included 1,147 patients who underwent cesarean sections at Barnes-Jewish Hospital from 2011 to 2015. Of 572 patients randomly assigned to receive the chlorhexidine-alcohol combination, 23 developed an infection at the site of the surgery within 30 days of the procedure. Of 575 patients who randomly received the iodine-alcohol combination, 42 developed a surgical-site infection.\n\nThe investigators pointed out that all other standard procedures for reducing the risk of infection after surgery, including giving preventive antibiotics beforehand, were the same in both groups.\n\nStudies of other types of surgeries also have suggested the superiority of chlorhexidine over iodine in preventing infection. But according to Tuuli, the unique circumstances of a C-section \u2014 that bacteria come from both skin and vagina and that a woman\u2019s immune system is altered during pregnancy \u2014 mean the results of these studies may not apply.\n\nIn addition, past trials comparing antiseptics before surgery included relatively few participants and often compared a chlorhexidine-alcohol combination with iodine alone. These studies could not determine whether the worse performance of iodine alone was due to the chlorhexidine, the alcohol or the combination.\n\nAlthough the new study was conducted at only one hospital, the researchers said the patient population was racially diverse and that more than 60 percent received public insurance. Tuuli and his colleagues also pointed out that the superiority of the chlorhexidine-alcohol combination was consistent whether the C-section was scheduled or unscheduled, whether or not the patient was obese, whether staples or sutures were used to close the wound and whether the patient had chronic medical conditions, including diabetes.\n\nHighlighting the significance of the findings, the study\u2019s senior author, George A. Macones, MD, the Mitchell and Elaine Yanow Professor and head of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, said, \u201cThis study is a tremendous addition to the literature on preventing surgical-site infections after cesarean.

The discovery could greatly expand the window for diagnosing concussions, especially in patients who experience a delayed onset of symptoms.\n\n\"Symptoms of a concussion, or a mild to moderate traumatic brain injury, can be subtle and are often delayed, in many cases by several days,\" said Linda Papa, MD, MSC, an emergency medicine physician and NIH funded researcher at Orlando Health and lead author of the study. \"This could provide doctors with an important tool for simply and accurately diagnosing those patients, particularly children, and making sure they are treated properly.\"\n\nIt's estimated nearly a quarter of a million children are treated in hospitals each year for concussions from playing sports, an average of nearly 700 a day. Almost all concussions in children are diagnosed only by symptoms, which are either observed, like vomiting or loss of balance, or symptoms reported by the child, like blurred vision or headaches. Neither scenario gives doctors and objective way to determine the severity of the injury.\n\n\"If patients are not diagnosed properly and treated appropriately, it could lead to long-term problems,\" said Papa. Untreated, or under-treated traumatic brain injuries like concussions, can lead to prolonged bouts with headaches, dizziness, memory loss and depression.\n\n\"This test could take the guesswork out of making a diagnosis by allowing doctors to simply look for a specific biomarker in the blood.\"\n\nThe biomarker Papa analyzed is known as a glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). These proteins are found in glial cells, which surround neurons in the brain, and when an injury occurs, the GFAP are released. What makes them unique is that they pass the blood-brain barrier and enter the bloodstream, making them easy to detect with this particular test.\n\n\"Not only were they present in the bloodstream, we were able to detect measurable levels of GFAP up to a week after the injury,\" said Papa.\n\nResearchers analyzed nearly 600 patients for 3 years. When cross-checked with scans, the blood test was able to detect mild to moderate traumatic brain lesions with up to 97 percent accuracy in patients 18 years and older. The blood test also indicated which patients were in need of life-saving neurosurgery. This suggests that the blood test could be used by clinicians for up to a week after injury to detect brain injury. This is important because many patients with concussion may not seek medical attention for days after injury.\n\nThe blood test could also dramatically cut down on the need for computerized tomography (CT) scans. Currently, CT scans are the most precise way to diagnose brain lesions, but are expensive and are associated with radiation exposure. \"Physicians really want to minimize the amount of CTs in patients, especially children, who are a lot more sensitive to radiation and the side effects that can come with it. Fortunately, this simple blood test appears to give us nearly the same information as a CT scan.\"\n\nIn fact, in a previous study published last fall, Papa and her team at Orlando Health tested both. They analyzed 152 children within 6 hours of sustaining a concussion, or mild to moderate traumatic brain injury. The results showed that the blood test was able to detect brain injuries with 94 percent accuracy, nearly as effective as state-of-the art CT scans.\n\n\"This could ultimately change the way we diagnose concussions, not only in children, but in anyone who sustains a head injury,\" said Papa. \"We have so many diagnostic blood tests for different parts of the body, like the heart, liver and kidneys, but there's never been a reliable blood test to identify trauma in the brain. We think this test could change that,\" she said.\n\nB-ROLL, SOUND BITES, WEB ELEMENTS & HI-RES STILL PHOTOS - Including HD video available for free/unrestricted use by the news media: http://bit.\n\nFor assistance in downloading, or if you have any questions, contact: drew@mediasourcetv.com or call: 614.932.9950\n\nOrlando Health is a $2.1 billion not-for-profit health care organization and a community-based network of physician practices, hospitals, and outpatient care centers throughout Central Florida.

All are probably still viable treatment options, but what we don't know is what each particular patient will need,\" Bronfort said, adding that it's possible a combination of treatments might be helpful, too.\n\nResults of the study are published in the Jan. 3 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine. Funding for the study was provided by the U.S. National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine.\n\nNeck pain is an extremely common problem. About three-quarters of adults report having neck pain at some point in their lives, according to background information in the study. Neck pain is responsible for millions of health care visits each year, and it can have a negative impact on quality of life.\n\nSpinal manipulation is one type of treatment that's offered for neck pain, and it can be administered by chiropractors, physical therapists, osteopaths and other health care providers, according to the study.\n\nBut, there isn't much evidence for treating neck pain with spinal manipulation. There also isn't a great deal of information on how effective medications or home exercise programs are for treating neck pain, the researchers noted.\n\nBronfort and colleagues thought that spinal manipulation might prove to be more effective than medications or home exercise therapy. To test their hypothesis, they recruited 272 people between the ages of 18 and 65 who had neck pain. Their neck pain had no known cause, such as a trauma or pinched nerve, and the patients been experiencing the pain for between two and 12 weeks when the study began.\n\nThe study volunteers were randomly selected for one of three treatment groups. One group received spinal manipulations over a 12-week period. Each individual was allowed to choose the number of spinal manipulations they felt they needed.\n\nThe second group received medications, both over the counter and prescription, depending on their needs. First-line medications included nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications or acetaminophen (Tylenol). If people didn't get relief from these drugs, narcotic pain medications and muscle relaxants were offered.\n\nThe third group was assigned two one-hour sessions of home exercise. The goal of the home-exercise program was to improve movement in the neck area. Participants were instructed to do the exercises six to eight times per day.\n\nAt the 12th week, 82 percent of people receiving spinal manipulation reported at least a 50 percent reduction in pain, compared with 69 percent of those on medication and 77 percent doing home exercises. Also at week 12, of people receiving spinal manipulation, 32 percent reported feeling a 100 percent reduction in pain, compared with 13 percent on medications and 30 percent doing home exercises.\n\nAt one year, 27 percent of those receiving spinal manipulation said they felt a 100 percent reduction in pain versus 17 percent of those on medications and 37 percent of those doing home exercises.\n\n\"For me, as an ER doctor, this study offers an interesting perspective,\" said Dr. Robert Glatter, an attending physician in emergency medicine at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"It's a small study, but it found that home exercises and spinal manipulation were effective. So, should we be referring to physical therapists, osteopaths or chiropractors from the ER?\"\n\n\"This study shows that basically neck pain will get better on its own,\" said Dr. Victor Khabie, chief of the departments of surgery and sports medicine at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. \"It would've been good if they had a no-treatment group, too,\" he added.\n\n\"Everyone heals differently. There are different pathways to healing, and whether you feel you're better off with chiropractic, home exercises or medications, this study shows that all three are basically just as effective. Whatever your pathway to healing, in about six to eight weeks, you should start to feel better,\" said Khabie.\n\nHe also noted that it's important for anyone receiving spinal manipulation to know that there are rare, but serious risks that can occur with neck manipulations.\n\nAll three experts said anyone experiencing neck pain needs to have it evaluated to make sure there isn't a serious or correctable cause of the pain. This is especially true if you've been in a car accident, or if you have any neurological symptoms, such as repeatedly dropping things, or if you have pain radiating down your arm.\n\nLearn more about neck pain, its causes and treatment from the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "It is clear that all of the treatments included in this trial are widely available.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A flu drug \u2014 shown to reduce the duration of symptoms \u2014 could upend treatment in U.S.\n\nNext winter, there may be a new drug for people who contract influenza \u2014 one that appears to be able to shut down infection quickly and, unlike anything else on the market, can be taken as a single dose.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday said that it would give the drug, baloxavir marboxil, a priority review, and approval has the potential to upend the way influenza is treated.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "It is clear from the story that the FDA is expected to decide by the end of the year whether to approve this new flu medication.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday it has approved Cotellic, a drug produced by Swiss biotech company Roche, for use in combination with the vemurafenib medication as a treatment for advanced melanoma.\n\nThe drugs are intended to target the illness after it has spread to other parts of the body or can\u2019t be removed by surgery.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Because this is an announcement from the FDA about approval, the drug will now be marketed for treatment, and the story clearly indicates that the drug combination is distributed by Genentech.\nWe\u2019ll rule this Satisfactory, but we\u2019d caution that\u00a0FDA approval does not necessarily equal availability.

A modified version of the Herpes Simplex 1 virus (known for causing cold sores and some cases of genital herpes) called T-Vec has successfully been used to treat melanoma in a phase III clinical trial. That means it's just waiting for a final okay from the FDA before the Amgen product can hit the market. The results of the trial were published Tuesday in Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\n[Personalized cancer vaccines have already helped treat three patients]\n\nIn a study of 436 patients with inoperable melanoma, Talimogene Laherparepvec had 16.3 percent of patients showing results at the six-month mark, compared to 2.1 percent taking the control therapy. Some patients were continuing to respond to T-VEC three years later.\n\nPatients with stage III and early stage IV melanoma treated with T-VEC (163 people in all) lived an average of 41 months. This compared with an average survival of 21.5 months in the 66 earlier-stage patients who received the control immunotherapy. Immunotherapy, where agents are used to boost a body's natural defense against a tumor, are already the best treatments against melanoma. But this is the first time a modified virus has been successful in carrying out that treatment.\n\n[One day, doctors might prescribe viruses instead of antibiotics]\n\nUsing a virus as a drug isn't a new idea. Phage therapy, where viruses that attack certain bacteria are used in place of antibiotics, is commonly used in Europe and on the rise in the United States. But cancer therapies like the one described in the new paper take things a step further, manipulating existing viruses to turn them into cancer-fighting tools.\n\nKevin Harrington, Professor of Biological Cancer Therapies at The Institute of Cancer Research and head of the trial, has been working on this particular virus for about a decade. Before he signed onto the project, it was primarily being investigated as a breast cancer treatment. But Harrington brought head, neck, and skin cancer patients into the mix, and melanoma seemed to have the best responses of all.\n\nHere's how T-VEC works: It starts with the herpes virus, which is magnificent at proliferating itself within cells and then causing them to burst (that's where the cold sores come from). But T-VEC has had two key genes removed. These keep it from replicating within healthy cells, which can quickly spot it because of the missing genes.\n\nBut cancer cells aren't as savvy, and T-VEC has its run of them. Meanwhile, T-VEC has also been modified to produce a molecule called GM-CSF, which serves as a red flag waved at the immune system.\n\nSo in addition to the destructive power of the T-VEC cells themselves, the therapy summons the immune system right to where it's needed -- the tumor.\n\n[Watch how the body\u2019s \u2018serial killers\u2019 stalk and attack cancer cells]\n\n\"This is a first in class agent, a brand new therapy,\" Harrington said. \"But it's just the farthest along of what we hope will be many more.\"\n\nHarrington expects the FDA to clear T-VEC within the year, and it could potentially be available to patients right away.\n\nBut there's more work to be done to determine just how T-VEC can fit into the cancer-treatment landscape. When the latest trial was started, Harrington explained, there was no standard of treatment for melanoma -- so it's compared to a treatment that no one expected to outpace T-VEC. Now that other therapies -- ones that target specific mutations in patients' cancer cells -- are showing more success than what was available when the trial was formed, researchers will have to see how T-VEC compares.\n\n\"The next steps are exciting, and already underway,\" he said. \"The next big frontier will be to combine this with existing immunotherapies. There's a strong rationale that other drugs on the market could act synogistically with ours.\"\n\nTrials are also underway to determine how T-VEC might do with other cancers.

Chan School of Public Health, whose study appears in the journal Pediatrics, analyzed data from a large, ongoing, national study of nurses focused on factors that influence women's health.\n\n\"The results of this study emphasize the role of an early life high-fiber diet on prevention of breast cancer in later life. High consumption of foods rich in fiber such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains in early life may help to reduce breast cancer incidence,\" lead author Maryam Farvid, a visiting scientist at Harvard, told CBS News.\n\nThe findings showed that breast cancer risk was 12 to 19 percent lower among women who ate more dietary fiber in their youth, depending on how much more they ate. Eating more fiber during adolescence was linked to a 16 percent lower risk of breast cancer overall, and a 24 percent lower risk of breast cancer before menopause.\n\nFarvid said the findings show that each additional 10 grams per day increase in fiber intake during adolescence reduced the risk of breast cancer by 14 percent.\n\n\"Having the recommended 25 to 30 grams of fiber daily would decrease the risk by 30 percent and potentially even greater with higher fiber intake,\" Farvid said. \"Women are doing themselves a huge favor in terms of breast cancer prevention if they increase the amount of dietary fiber intake earlier in life rather than later.\"\n\nEating more fruits and vegetables was especially beneficial, the researchers said.\n\nHealthy high-fiber food choices include apples, pears, raspberries, artichokes, green peas, broccoli, split peas, lentils, beans, whole wheat pasta, whole grain bread, brown rice, bran flakes, and oatmeal.\n\nWhy would these foods have such an impact?\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Duke University Medical Center's Dr. Kimberly Blackwell said there's longstanding evidence that dietary fiber may cut down on circulating estrogen levels through changes in the gut microbiome.\n\nShe said that recently more evidence has come to light suggesting a relationship between dietary fiber and breast cancer risk, and that eating more fiber would be a simple way to reduce risk.\n\nOne weakness she pointed out in the study is that the women were asked to recall details about their adolescent diet when they were in their 30s and 40s.

Its results built upon exciting data it released in June \u2014 showing that its drug can increase the window of time in which a woman\u2019s cancer doesn\u2019t get worse. (The study did not assess whether the drug helped women live longer, just how long it stopped tumors from growing.)\n\nA small pilot study on a drug called talazoparib, which is now owned by Pfizer, recently showed similarly compelling results.\n\nBut Colorado\u2019s Clovis Oncology fared less well. Though its own PARP inhibitor, rucaparib, showed that it could help some women compared to chemotherapy alone, its data didn\u2019t measure up to the other two trials. The company\u2019s stock plunged 18 percent on Friday after the data were released.\n\nOne PARP inhibitor has already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration: olaparib, sold by AstraZeneca as Lynparza. It\u2019s being used to treat ovarian cancer in women who have already undergone chemotherapy.\n\nChemotherapy deals heavy damage to tumors \u2014 but often, the cancer cells are able to regroup and repair themselves. PARP inhibitors work by stopping this repair. They\u2019re particularly useful in treating cancers associated with the BRCA mutation, since this gene codes for proteins that help repair damaged DNA.\n\nWhile chemotherapy is still used as a first line of attack, PARP inhibitors are largely being studied as maintenance drugs. The hope is that they\u2019ll keep cancer at bay once it\u2019s been attacked by chemo.\n\nA number of cancers are associated with BRCA mutations \u2014 including breast, prostate, and pancreatic.\n\nMore and more clinical trials will spring up to test PARP inhibitors in combination with other cancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, said Dr. Christina Annunziata, an investigator at the National Cancer Institute who studied the efficacy of Lynparza in ovarian cancer patients.\n\nThe field is so hot that over the summer, Pfizer agreed to spend an eye-popping $14 billion to buy San Francisco-based biotech Medivation. The key asset Pfizer wanted? The PARP inhibitor talazoparib. So far, there\u2019s just extremely early data, but it looks promising. In a pilot study of 13 breast cancer patients on the drug at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, tumors shrank on average 78 percent.\n\n\u201cWe found a significant decrease in the tumors with only two months of therapy,\u201d said Dr. Jennifer Litton, the lead investigator. She\u2019s launching a larger trial for further study.\n\nAs for Tesaro, it first shared initial data from a Phase 3 clinical trial this past June. It showed that patients with recurrent ovarian cancer treated with the drug got an extra 15 months without their disease getting worse, compared to a control group. At the European conference this weekend, Tesaro added a few more details to that data:\n\nThe study looked at 553 patients whose cancer responds to a certain type of chemotherapy, known as platinum chemo. The best results came from patients with the BRCA mutation: Their tumors didn\u2019t start to grow again for 21 months, on average, compared to 5.5 months for a control group that just received a placebo. Other groups of patients treated with the drug also had significantly better outcomes than control groups.\n\nThe results were published this weekend in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nA few weeks ago, the Food and Drug Administration granted Tesaro\u2019s drug fast-track approval status \u2014 and this new data will support its registration applications to both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, Tesaro CEO Lonnie Moulder said. The company is now planning trials in lung cancer, and is considering other cancers to pursue.\n\n\u201cIn the field, these would be described as landmark results,\u201d Moulder said. \u201cAt this time, there\u2019s nothing available that has been approved by regulatory agencies for these women who have recurrence to their ovarian cancer.\u201d\n\nThe company aims to use its PARP inhibitor, rucaparib, to treat only patients with BRCA mutations who have had two or more chemotherapies. But the data it presented at the European conference showed that the drug may not actually be more effective than Lynparza, the PARP inhibitor that\u2019s been marketed by AstraZeneca since 2014.\n\nThe study\u2019s lead investigator, Rebecca Kristeleit, defended the performance of rucaparib, adding that one can\u2019t compare Clovis\u2019s drug to Tesaro\u2019s: \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different population, and a different use of the drugs,\u201d she said.\n\nBecause early symptoms are fairly benign \u2014 bloating and back pain \u2014 about 75 percent of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer don\u2019t learn they have it until it has progressed to stage 3.

It\u2019s not the first study to show a potential anticancer effect of aspirin and other similar painkillers \u2014 a class of medications known and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. Previous studies have found that aspirin users enjoyed a lower risk of colon cancer; a trial published earlier this year concluded that people who take a daily aspirin have as much as a 46% lower risk of colon, lung and prostate cancers, compared with non-users.\n\nIn the current trial, researchers looked at all cancer cases in the Danish Cancer Registry from 1991 to 2009 and compared this data against that of a prescription-drug database that recorded patients\u2019 histories of using aspirin, NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors, drugs that all work in similar ways to reduce inflammation and dull pain.\n\nOverall, 18,532 cases of skin cancer were included in the study. Each case was compared to 10 matched controls who did not develop the disease. Over the study period, people who filled more than two prescriptions for aspirin, NSAIDS or COX-2 inhibitors had a 13% lower risk of melanoma and a 15% lower risk of squamous cell carcinoma than those who filled fewer prescriptions, the researchers found.\n\nThe longer people took the drugs, and the higher the dose, the greater the anticancer benefit. Longer, higher-intensity use, for example, led to a 46% lower risk of melanoma, a 35% lower risk of squamous cell carcinoma and a 17% lower risk of basal cell carcinoma, the most common form of skin cancer in the U.S. The relationship held even after the researchers adjusted for potential confounders that could affect the risk of skin cancer, such as use of other medications. However, the researchers didn\u2019t have information on other key skin cancer risk factors like exposure to UV radiation.\n\nThe drugs are thought to counter cancer growth by suppressing inflammatory pathways and stimulating tumors\u2019 ability to expand and develop blood supplies.\n\n\u201cGiven the high skin cancer incidence and the widespread and frequent use of NSAIDs, a preventive effect of these agents may have important public health implications,\u201d the authors, led by Sigrun Alba Johannesdottir from Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark, wrote.\n\nIn the U.S., skin cancer is the most common form of cancer diagnosed, affecting more than 2 million people each year. But taking aspirin and aspirin-like drugs isn\u2019t without consequences: they may have harmful side effects on the stomach and digestive tract, causing bleeding and dangerous ulcers. (One COX-2 inhibitor, Vioxx, was voluntarily pulled from the market by its maker in 2004 after it was linked to an increased risk of heart disease.)\n\nBut given the growing body of data linking aspirin use to lower cancer risk, the researchers say it may be worth factoring in the drugs\u2019 anticancer effects when patients and doctors discuss options for pain relievers. \u201cWe hope that the potential cancer-protective effect of NSAIDs will inspire more research on skin cancer prevention,\u201d Johannesdottir said in a statement. \u201cAlso, this potential cancer-protective effect should be taken into account when discussing benefits and harms of NSAID use.\u201d\n\nAlice Park is a writer at TIME.

Using HIFU, doctors can focus on treating only the cancer cells on the prostate while causing minimal damage to the surrounding tissue. Unlike more common and invasive treatments such as radiotherapy and surgical removal of the prostate gland, HIFU may be able to avoid side effects like urine leakage and impotence.\n\nThe new study, designed as a proof-of-concept study, involved just 41 men. Doctors used MRI and mapping biopsies to locate the cancerous tissues. They then focused high-energy sound waves on the affected area, causing the cancer cells to heat up to around 80\u00b0C, which kills the cells. None of the patients reported urinary incontinence a year after treatment, and only 1 in 10 suffered from poor erections. Overall, about 95% of the men were cancer-free after a full year following the trial.\n\n\u201cThe signal from this study is quite strong,\u201d study author Hashim Ahmed, a urologist at the University College London, told Bloomberg. \u201cWhen you look at the current standard of care, there\u2019s a 1-in-3, or 1-in-2 chance of having the perfect outcome. In this study, after 12 months, it\u2019s a 9-in-10 chance.\u201d\n\nThe men in the study were aged 45 to 80 with medium- to high-risk cancer, and would likely have undergone surgery or radiotherapy down the line. Men who had already received chemotherapy, hormone treatment or radiation therapy were excluded from the study. The procedure was carried out under general anesthesia and most of the patients had hospital stays of less than 24 hours after the treatment.\n\n\u201cFocal therapy of individual prostate-cancer lesions, regardless of whether they are multifocal or unifocal, leads to a low rate of genitourinary side-effects and an encouraging rate of early freedom from clinically significant prostate cancer,\u201d the authors concluded in the study.\n\nProstate cancer is the most common cancer among men. The National Cancer Institute estimates 241,740 new cases of prostate cancer this year in the U.S. and 28,170 deaths.\n\nAhmed told Bloomberg that HIFU may also be cheaper than other standard treatments, noting that the cost of the MRI and mapping was an estimated $2,400, plus about $1,600 for HIFU; in comparison, removing the prostate costs about $7,100. Fewer side effects would also lower other health care costs, he said.\n\nThe researchers are now recruiting more patients and seeking funding for larger studies. While the initial results were promising, they need to be replicated; HIFU also needs to be studied long-term and compared with other therapies.

Still, the drug -- or others like it in development -- could add to the power of new drugs in the pipeline that are poised to cure many more people with hepatitis C, said Dr. Eugene R. Schiff, director of the University of Miami's Center for Liver Diseases.\n\nThe greater possibility of a cure and fewer side effects, in turn, will lead more people who think they have hepatitis C to \"come out of the woodwork,\" said Schiff, who's familiar with the study findings. \"They'll want to know if they're positive.\"\n\nAn estimated 4 million people in the United States have hepatitis C, but only about 1 million are thought to have been diagnosed. The disease, transmitted through infected blood, can lead to liver cancer, scarring of the liver, known as cirrhosis, and death.\n\nExisting treatments can cure about half of the cases. As Schiff explained, people's genetic makeup has a lot to do with whether they respond to the treatment. Those with Asian heritage do better, whereas those with an African background do worse, he said.\n\nAnd there's another potential problem with existing treatments.

Brenner, a professor of radiation oncology at Columbia University who co-authored the most recent of a series of reports in the past year warning about the potential risks of CT scans. \"On an individual basis there's probably not a big risk, but a small cancer risk applied to an increasingly large population spells trouble down the road. That's the concern.\"\n\nAlthough some prominent medical groups have issued warnings against overusing the exams -- especially for children -- some experts worry about frightening patients away from the invaluable tests.\n\n\"You don't want people to avoid getting a potentially lifesaving diagnosis or therapy because they are afraid to get a CT scan,\" said Arl Van Moore Jr., a Charlotte radiologist who chairs the American College of Radiology's board of chancellors. \"When a scan is done the right way for the right reasons, the benefits clearly outweigh the risks of doing it.\"\n\nCT (computed tomography), sometimes called CAT (computed axial tomography), is performed by computerized machines that scan patients with X-rays to create three-dimensional cross-sectional images of organs and other parts of the body, providing far greater detail than standard single X-rays.\n\nThe number of scans performed each year in the United States has increased sharply, rising from about 3 million in 1980 to at least 67 million in 2006. There are many reasons for the increase, including improvements in the technology that have speeded the procedure, a growing list of uses and a proliferation of the machines.\n\n\"CT has become ubiquitous,\" said Jason Launders, a senior project officer at the ECRI Institute, an independent nonprofit health-care research organization outside Philadelphia that released a report last year warning about the potential risks. \"Now if you go into an emergency room you can be scanned in a few minutes. You can't get that kind of information any other way. So physicians tend to use CT as sort of a first line in working out a diagnosis.\"\n\nThe use of CT scans is expected to continue to rise as possible new applications, such as for lung and colon cancer screening, become more widespread.\n\nWhile the value of CT scans for screening remains the focus of debate, no one questions the value of the tests for allowing doctors to quickly diagnose a wide variety of health problems, including head injuries, heart problems, cancer, appendicitis, fractures and gallstones.\n\n\"CT is probably the biggest advance in diagnostic radiology that has ever occurred,\" said Thomas Ohlhaber, deputy director of the Division of Mammography Quality and Radiation Programs at the Food and Drug Administration. \"Exploratory surgery that was common 10 or 15 years ago has virtually disappeared and all the risks associated with that have gone away because of CT. But nothing comes free of risks.\"\n\nThe concern comes from the fact that CT scans expose patients to much more radiation than standard X-rays. A CT chest scan, for example, exposes a patient to more than 150 times more radiation than a standard chest X-ray. That's more than twice as much as a typical person receives from the environment in an entire year. (See graphic.)\n\nThe upsurge in CT use has fueled a big jump in the annual amount of radiation that each American is receiving from medical procedures of all kinds. The average level of that exposure has increased about 600-fold since 1980, according to a federal report being published this year.\n\n\"At the moment, about half of medical radiation exposure is from CT scans,\" said Fred A. Mettler Jr., a radiation health expert at the University of New Mexico who helped prepare the report. CT scans represented just a few percent of the average American's exposure to radiation from medical tests in 1980, he noted.\n\nBecause it would take decades to follow a large number of patients who have undergone CT scans to determine the exact risks posed by the exams, there are no direct data demonstrating the danger. But researchers have estimated the risk based on what is considered the best information available about the health effects of radiation -- data collected from survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as exposure of nuclear plant and medical workers.\n\nUsing that information, experts have estimated that every 1,000 to 2,000 CT scans may produce one fatal cancer that would not have occurred otherwise.\n\nAlthough that overall risk is relatively small, the large number of scans being performed could translate into a significant number of cancers. Brenner and his colleagues estimate that CT scans may be responsible for perhaps 2 percent of all cancers in the United States. The ECRI Institute estimated the scans may be causing 6,000 extra cancers each year, half of them fatal.\n\n\"Twenty years from now we could see a huge bonus of cancer coming through because of indiscriminate use of CT today,\" Launders said. \"That's the real issue people are worried about.\"\n\nThe individual risk varies depending on the age of the patient and the type of scan. Younger people face more risk than older people because they have more time for a cancer to develop. Children are especially vulnerable because their rapidly developing bodies are at least four times as sensitive to the damaging effects of radiation. A child's risk may run as high as one case of cancer for every 500 scans, experts say.\n\nAmong adults, \"young women have the highest risk,\" said Andrew Einstein of Columbia University, who evaluated the risks from cardiac CT scans in a paper published in July in the Journal of the American Medical Association. A 20-year-old woman faced the greatest risk -- one additional cancer for every 143 scans, he reported.\n\nSome question the estimates, saying the risk of exposure from radiation from multiple CT scans may not be the same as from radiation from an atomic bomb.\n\n\"It's very difficult, in our opinion to equate the data from Hiroshima, where you had an instantaneous entire-body dose of radiation, compared to a cumulative dose for multiple CT scans,\" said Moore, the radiologist. \"It's apples and oranges. It's not really the same.\"\n\nEinstein, Mettler and others, however, disagree. \"Radiation is radiation. Those are X-rays that the folks at Hiroshima and Nagasaki got. These are X-rays from a CT scan. They're really the same thing,\" said Brenner, whose report was published in November in the New England Journal of Medicine. \"If the dose is the same, then the risk is going to be the same.\"\n\nAlthough the companies that make the CT machines have been developing new protocols designed to minimize radiation exposure, particularly for children, everyone agrees that the most prudent thing to do is to eliminate unnecessary use.\n\nWhile there are scant hard data about how often CT scans are done needlessly, several experts estimated that perhaps one-third could be eliminated. There are many reasons CTs may be overused. Some CTs are full-body \"virtual physicals\" performed on people who appear perfectly healthy -- a practice widely opposed by medical authorities.\n\nSome say part of the blame lies with physicians who have financial interests in imaging facilities. \"There is statistical evidence that indicates that more scans are ordered when a physician has a financial interest than when he doesn't,\" said Moore.\n\nDefensive medicine also plays a role, with some doctors ordering the tests to stave off accusations that they withheld the most cutting-edge technology from their patients.\n\nIn other cases, overuse results from worried patients and from parents demanding CT scans that may not be needed. Other times doctors may not realize how many tests involving radiation patients have already undergone -- information that could influence a doctor's decision -- or may order a CT scan when other tests that do not involve radiation, such as a blood test, an MRI or an ultrasound, would suffice. \"There are alternatives that are arguably just as good,\" Brenner said.\n\nAnd patients also can take more responsibility for reducing the number of unnecessary scans.\n\n\"If a patient walks in and says, 'Tell me what the dose is from this and tell me what the risk is,' they are going to make the doctor start thinking about it,\" Mettler said.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Clearly CT scans are available.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "An Online Program May Help Prevent Depression In Some People\n\nWorking through a self-help program online can prevent or delay major depression disorder in people who are vulnerable, a study finds. Similar programs have been used to treat depression, but this may be the first one tested to prevent it, the researchers say.\n\nOnline programs for mental health problems can be as effective as face-to-face treatment and offer some advantages: Low cost, available at any time and customizable. But they're not panaceas.\n\nIn this experiment, half of the participants were asked to do six half-hour-long exercises that were based on cognitive behavioral therapy and problem-solving therapy, which are techniques commonly used for in-person therapy.\n\nIn the cognitive behavioral therapy, participants were asked to identify positive activities they used to engage in and then are asked to actively plan those activities again. At the next session, participants reflect on their experiences.\n\nFor the problem-solving therapy, people were asked to create a list of the things that matter most to them in their lives and brainstorm on how to incorporate those things into daily life. They next were asked to categorize problems and worries into \"manageable\" and \"unmanageable\"; the main focus in problem-solving therapy is to tackle those problems that are considered manageable.\n\nBoth cognitive-behavioral therapy and problem-solving therapy are intended to change negative thinking in order to alter mood and behavior.\n\nAfter completing each exercise, participants in the intervention group received written individualized feedback from an online trainer. The trainers did not offer any therapeutic advice, only motivation and encouragement to continue the exercises. Participants also could repeat the online sessions as often as they liked.\n\nThe control group received information about depression but was under no obligation to read it.\n\nThe study, which was conducted by researchers from Leuphana University in Lueneburg, Germany, recruited 406 people with subthreshold depression, which is defined as having some symptoms of depression but not enough to be diagnosed with major depressive disorder. It was published Tuesday in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nOf the 406 participants that began the study, 335 completed the telephone follow-up at the end of 12 months. Twenty-seven percent in the intervention group experienced depression compared with 41 percent in the control group.\n\nIt is unclear if the people who went on to develop major depressive disorder had experienced it before. Lead author Claudia Buntrock, a PhD candidate in clinical psychology at Leuphana, says that because the study only tracked participants' mental health over the course of 12 months, the long-term effectiveness of the intervention is unknown.\n\nIt's also not clear if this kind of program could be scaled up. It took the trainers about 30 minutes to provide feedback for each session, and they also stayed in touch with participants via instant messaging, Buntrock says.\n\nOther experiments with online therapy have found that people didn't continue it if it wasn't guided by an actual human. One reason could be that when people are depressed, they can have a hard time getting motivated to do things.\n\n\"More studies are needed to evaluate the preventive effects of unguided web-based interventions on the onset of major depressive disorder,\" Buntrock wrote in an email. Still, Buntrock seems pleased with the results, especially since the German insurance company BARMER GEK that sponsored the trial is now providing it to its customers.\n\n\"I was surprised by the big response to our study,\" Buntrock wrote. \"And of course, I'm surprised about what happens now; that a health insurance company offers the intervention to its members.

(1)\n\nThis paper emphasized that overall diet quality, rather than individual foods, may have a greater impact on reducing risk of physical function impairments. Specifically, diet quality traits most associated with reduced rates of incident physical impairment were higher intake of fruits and vegetables; lower intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, trans fat, and sodium; and moderate alcohol intake. Among food components, the strongest relations were found for increased intakes of oranges, orange juice, apples, pears, romaine or leaf lettuce, and walnuts.\n\n\"There's a lot of research that looks at specific health conditions in aging, such as diabetes and heart disease, but less attention to research on quality of life and ability to maintain independence with aging,\" said Dr. Francine Grodstein, ScD, professor of medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. \"The simple message from this study is that eating an overall healthy diet, including certain foods, such as walnuts and other whole foods, may help women with the ability to do key everyday tasks as they age, like carrying groceries or dressing themselves.\"\n\nThe researchers looked at data from 54,762 women in the Nurses' Health Study, which tracked women for over 30 years. Between 1992 and 2008, the women were asked questions about their physical function, including their ability to perform basic activities of daily living. This new paper prospectively examined the association between the dietary habits of the participants and subsequent impairment in physical function. Diet was assessed using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-2010), a measure of diet quality that incorporates foods and nutrients predictive of chronic disease risk based on scientific evidence.\n\n\"These results add to the large body of evidence that outline the many benefits of a healthy diet for women. Additional research is needed to better understand how diet and lifestyle choices can help maintain our health and well-being as we age,\" said Dr. Grodstein.\n\nThere are numerous possible active properties in walnuts that may be contributing factors in providing health benefits. Walnuts are unique among nuts in that they are primarily composed of polyunsaturated fat (13 grams per ounce), which includes alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), the plant-based omega-3 fatty acid. They are the only nut to contain a significant amount of ALA with 2.5 grams per one ounce serving.\n\nSome study limitations should be considered. The sample only included women, so these results may not be generalizable to men. Additionally, participants were not assigned to eat walnuts or other foods, and were just asked about their dietary choices. It is also possible that subjects may have misreported their dietary intake since this information was collected by questionnaires. In addition, because this is an observational study, residual confounding cannot be ruled out (i.e. that other lifestyle habits which are more common in adults who eat walnuts could contribute to the study findings); and, thus, the results should be interpreted with caution.\n\nThis research was supported in part by the California Walnut Commission (CWC). The CWC has supported health-related research on walnuts for more than 25 years. While the CWC does provide funds and/or walnuts for various projects, the actual studies are conducted independently by researchers who design the experiments, interpret the results and write the manuscripts.\n\nThe California Walnut Commission, established in 1987, is funded by mandatory assessments of the growers.

Early-stage cancer is easier to treat and has a higher survival rate.\n\nThe new study provides further evidence of that. Researchers led by Dr. Ryoichi Kondo of Shinshu University Hospital in Matsumoto looked back at outcomes for close to 500 non-smoking lung cancer patients whose cancer was caught by CT scan screening, or by standard X-ray screening \u2014 another strategy for catching cancer early \u2014 or when patients came into the doctor with lung symptoms.\n\nMost of the tumors found via CT scans were small, whereas those found through X-ray screening or in patients with symptoms were more often further advanced, according to the findings published in the journal Lung Cancer.\n\nFive years after their diagnosis, 95 percent of people whose cancers were found through a CT scan were still alive, compared to 73 percent diagnosed with an X-ray and 40 percent of patients who had not been screened and whose symptoms led to discovery their disease.\n\nEast Asian countries are more likely to regularly screen non-smokers for lung cancer because biological differences seem to put Asians at a higher risk than other non-smokers, researchers explained.\n\nNon-smokers without symptoms generally are not screened for lung cancer in the U.S.\n\nThere and in Canada, the lung cancer debate has centered around how often to screen smokers, and until what age screening should be done, Roberts said.\n\nIn another study published by Kondo and colleagues \u2014 this one looking at lung cancer screening in smokers \u2014 five-year survival rates were also highest in those screened with CT scans.\n\nThat\u2019s consistent with the findings of the National Lung Screening Trial in the U.S., which in November released data \u2014 published online in the New England Journal of Medicine last week \u2014 showing that 20 percent fewer middle-aged heavy smokers died of lung cancer when they were screened annually with a CT scan compared to a standard, less detailed chest X-ray.\n\nLung cancer kills more people in the U.S. than any other cancer \u2014 over 150,000 each year.\n\nThe problem with frequent screening is not only its cost \u2014 CT scans typically run a few hundred dollars each \u2014 but that each scan exposes a person to radiation, which also slightly increases cancer risks over time with repeated scans.\n\nAnd screening comes with an inherent risk of false-positives \u2014 scans which suggest a lung cancer that turns out not to be there.\n\nDr. Christine Berg, one of the leaders of the U.S. screening studies, said that generally about a quarter of chest CT scans show some kind of abnormality \u2014 but 96 percent of those abnormal scans turn out not to be lung cancer. While doctors ruled out cancer, those patients would have undergone further tests, sometimes including biopsies, which can cause complications including infection and bleeding.\n\nAnd for some patients, \u201cif you really weren\u2019t going to benefit from the screening...that complication is something you may not have faced,\u201d Berg said. \u201cThose are some of the things I worry about.\u201d\n\nHer study showed that 300 middle-aged smokers would need to be screened with CT scans to prevent one death from lung cancer.\n\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federally-supported expert panel, has said there isn\u2019t enough evidence for it to recommend screening for lung cancer in symptom-free people using CT scans or other methods.\n\nBerg and Roberts both told Reuters Health that more research is needed to see if there might be hints in the blood or genes of smokers that could tell doctors which had the highest risk for lung cancer \u2014 and which would get the most out of routine CT screening.\n\n\u201cWe now have a technology that can detect (lung cancer) early enough to make some impact,\u201d Berg said.

A major government study found the screening scans saved the life of one person for every 300 current or former smokers who were scanned.\n\nBut now cancer and screening experts are worried that the limited findings will be used by private screening centers to promote the test to a broader group than was studied. That, in turn, could lead to thousands of unnecessary lung scans, causing excess radiation exposure and unnecessary biopsies and surgery.\n\nDr. Otis W. Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said he was stunned to hear a radio advertisement for an Atlanta screening center cite the study just a few days after the government had announced the results. The wording of the ad seemed to be aimed at a broad group, ranging from heavy smokers to women who had never smoked, Dr. Brawley said.\n\n\u201cWe really need to weigh the harms associated with screening,\u201d he said. \u201cThe scientific community still needs to digest this. To take a trial that involves people at high risk for lung cancer and to extrapolate it and say it\u2019s good for people with intermediate or low risk is not appropriate.\u201d\n\nThe study, called the National Lung Screening Trial, focused on a specific high-risk group: 53,000 current and former heavy smokers, aged 55 to 74, who had smoked for at least 30 pack-years. That means someone who smoked one pack a day for 30 years, two packs a day for 15 years or three packs a day for at least 10 years would qualify for the study.\n\nFormer smokers who had accumulated 30 pack-years were included only if they had stopped smoking within the previous 15 years.\n\nThe smokers and former smokers were given either annual CT lung scans or chest X-rays. Compared with conventional X-rays, the CT, or computed tomography, scans create a detailed three-dimensional image of the lungs. The study was stopped when it was found that the scanning group had a 20 percent lower risk of dying from lung cancer than those being screened with X-rays.\n\nBut the early results also showed a downside of scanning: one of every four lung scans showed an abnormality, which often led to additional worry, radiation exposure from follow-up scans and, sometimes, lung biopsies and even risky surgery. But because the study was stopped early, a full analysis of the harms caused by screening scans is still months away.\n\nReading the scans is tricky because harmless nodules can be misinterpreted as suspect lesions. In the study, even experienced radiologists at major cancer centers had a high rate of false positives, suggesting that the rate would be even higher in the real world.\n\n\u201cThere is a learning curve to reading spiral CTs,\u201d Dr. Brawley said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that some radiologists might be early in that learning curve and some patients may be harmed because of it.\u201d\n\nWhile the study found a benefit to scanning a specific group of high-risk smokers, that doesn\u2019t mean other groups will get the same benefit, says Dr. Peter B. Bach, a pulmonologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. In lower-risk groups, for instance, it\u2019s likely that thousands of people would need to be exposed to the risks of screening before a single life was saved. And it\u2019s possible that many of those scanned unnecessarily could be seriously harmed.\n\n\u201cThe aggregate harms to all the people\u2019s lives who are not saved have to be taken into account,\u201d Dr. Bach said. \u201cEven in these highly controlled settings, about 1 percent of the people had surgery or a part of their lung removed for something they thought was cancer and it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nLow-dose CT scans expose patients to about the same radiation levels as mammograms.\n\nFor now, most consumers who want a scan will have to pay for it themselves, although it is expected that insurance companies eventually will approve scanning for those in high-risk groups. (Medicare officials have indicated that they will soon reconsider paying for the screening tests.) The government has estimated the cost at about $300 a scan, but some centers may charge $1,000 or more.\n\nThe day the government announced the study results, Westside Medical Imaging of Beverly Hills, Calif., issued a press release saying that the study \u201cshould once and for all settle the controversy\u201d about whether CT lung scans save lives.\n\nIn the release, Dr. Norman E. Lepor said the scans were an \u201cindispensable\u201d part of annual exams for patients who have smoked for 10 years.\n\nIn an interview, Dr. Lepor said that he only offers lung scans to those at high risk, and that he turns people away who are at low risk but want the scan anyway because \u201cthey just want to know.\u201d\n\nDr. Lepor said it would be \u201cimprudent\u201d not to incorporate the latest study data into his practice right away.\n\n\u201cThere are people who, with good conscience and their take of the data, say it\u2019s not ready for prime time, and there are people who look at the same data and they come to other conclusions,\u201d Dr. Lepor said. \u201cThis is not the first study that has supported screening.

In a study published this week in mBio\u00ae, an open-access journal of the American Society for Microbiology, the team shows that a live, attenuated version of the Zika virus could form the basis of a new treatment option for this fatal brain cancer.\n\nGlioblastoma kills about 15,000 adults in the US each year and is currently incurable because patients experience a high recurrence rate of their cancer even after the standard treatments of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Scientists suspect this recurrence is due to cancer stem cells, called glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), which hide out in nearby brain tissue even after the combination of therapies.\n\n\"During the Zika epidemic, we learned that the virus preferentially infects neural progenitor cells in the fetus, and causes the devastating microcephaly seen in babies born to infected mothers,\" says Pei-Yong Shi, a virologist at University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. He co-led the current study with tumor biologist Jianghong Man of the National Center of Biomedical Analysis in Beijing and virologist Cheng-Feng Qin of the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Beijing.\n\n\"We made the connection that perhaps Zika virus could also specifically infect the GSCs,\" because these cells have similar properties to neural stem cells, says Man. In previous work, Shi and his collaborators at Washington University in St. Louis showed that Zika virus did indeed attack and kill GSCs grown in the lab dish and in a mouse model of glioblastoma. In addition, the Zika virus was much less efficient at attacking the differentiated, healthy brain cells. (image: transmission electron micrograph of Zika virus, NIAID)\n\n\"If we could find a way to specifically target those GSCs that are the source of recurrence, then that might provide an option to prevent recurrence or even a cure,\" says Qin.\n\nThe team's first objective was to determine if there was a safe way to use Zika virus in patients to attack the cancer cells. Shi's lab has developed a promising live-attenuated Zika vaccine candidate called ZIKV-LAV that had been shown to be safe, non-virulent, and effective in protecting against infection in mice and non-human primates. The ZIKV-LAV has a small deletion from the viral genome that prevents it from replicating itself efficiently.\n\nWhen the team injected this ZIKV-LAV into the brains of mice, they saw no health effects on the mice, no weight loss, and no behavioral abnormalities such as loss of appetite, depression, lethargy, or self-injury. The mice also functioned normally in tests for anxiety and motor function.\n\nNext, the team wanted to show whether the ZIKA-LAV could work to infect and kill human patient-derived GSCs in a mouse model. So they mixed GSCs from two different human patient donors with the ZIKA-LAV and injected the mixture into the brains of mice. Mice that got the injection of the GSCs only rapidly developed tumors. Mice that got the ZIKV-LAV injected as well saw a significant delay in tumor development. Co-implanting the virus along with the GSCs also prolonged the median survival time of the treated mice to around 50 days, compared to around 30 days for the untreated mice who received GSCs alone.\n\nQin says that perhaps in the future patients would be given the Zika vaccine at the same time as surgery to \"let the viruses hunt down the GSCs and eliminate them.\"\n\nFinally, the team investigated the cellular mechanisms that the modified Zika virus used to kill the GSCs. They took GSCs treated with the ZIKV-LAV and those GSCs not treated and sequenced all the RNA messages being expressed in these two cell populations. Comparing those profiles, the team found that in the treated cells, the virus triggered a strong antiviral response in the cells, which induced inflammation and eventually cell death.\n\nNext, the team will work with clinicians to develop safety tests of the ZIKV-LAV in glioblastoma patients. They may also modify the Zika virus further to make it an even more potent cancer cell killing machine. For example, Man explains, the researchers could add an immune modulator as a 'cargo' in the viral genome. Then, once such a virus infects a cancer cell and kills it, the immune modulator would be released to alert and activate the patient's systemic immune system against the remaining cancer cells.\n\n\"As a virologist, I see that we should take advantage of the 'bad' side of viruses,\" says Shi. \"They should have a role to play in cancer treatment.\"\n\nThe American Society for Microbiology is the largest single life science society, composed of more than 30,000 scientists and health professionals.

In addition, their revamped statistical analyses of urine samples submitted both by healthy patients and those diagnosed with breast cancer yielded 85 percent average accuracy.\n\n\"Breast cancer survival is strongly tied to the sensitivity of tumor detection; accurate methods for detecting smaller, earlier tumors remains a priority,\" says Prof. Yehuda Zeiri, a member of Ben-Gurion University's Department of Biomedical Engineering. \"Our new approach utilizing urine and exhaled breath samples, analyzed with inexpensive, commercially available processes, is non-invasive, accessible and may be easily implemented in a variety of settings.\"\n\nThe study reports breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among females and the leading cause of death around the world. In 2016, breast cancer accounted for 29 percent of all new cancers identified in the United States and was responsible for 14 percent of all cancer-related deaths.\n\nMammography screenings, which are proven to significantly reduce breast cancer mortality, are not always able to detect small tumors in dense breast tissue. In fact, typical mammography sensitivity, which is 75 to 85 percent accurate, decreases to 30 to 50 percent in dense tissue.\n\nCurrent diagnostic imaging detection for smaller tumors has significant drawbacks: dual-energy digital mammography, while effective, increases radiation exposure, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is expensive. Biopsies and serum biomarker identification processes are invasive, equipment-intensive and require significant expertise.\n\n\"We've now shown that inexpensive, commercial electronic noses are sufficient for classifying cancer patients at early stages,\" says Prof. Zeiri. \"With further study, it may also be possible to analyze exhaled breath and urine samples to identify other cancer types, as well.\"\n\nStudy contributors include: Ben-Gurion University biomedical engineering researchers Prof. Yehuda Zeiri, Or Herman-Saffar, Zvi Boger, and Raphael Gonen; Dr. Shai Libson, a surgeon in the Breast Health Center at Soroka; and Dr. David Lieberman, an associate professor in Ben-Gurion University's Joyce and Irving Goldman Medical School, Faculty of Health Sciences.\n\nAbout American Associates, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev\n\nAmerican Associates, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (AABGU) plays a vital role in sustaining David Ben-Gurion's vision: creating a world-class institution of education and research in the Israeli desert, nurturing the Negev community and sharing the University's expertise locally and around the globe.

(Oct. 29, 2015) - Rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is one of the most dramatic medical emergencies a person can face. It usually strikes without warning, killing approximately 50 percent of those who experience it before they reach a hospital. Of those who do get to a health facility alive, only about 50 percent survive. When diagnosed through screening, aortic aneurysms are carefully monitored for signs of enlargement, and surgical intervention often is needed to prevent rupture of the vessel. Now, University of Missouri researchers have found that patients who took cholesterol-lowering medications before endovascular surgery experienced fewer complications and better outcomes.\n\n\"Although this condition usually occurs in men older than 50 with a family history of the disease, anyone can have an abdominal aortic aneurysm,\" said Todd Vogel, associate professor and chief of the Division of Vascular Surgery at the MU School of Medicine, and lead author of the study. \"Most patients with this disease are older and tend to have other health conditions such as high cholesterol. In an effort to prevent cardiovascular disease they take statin medications. These cholesterol-lowering medications protect blood vessels from plaque formation and stress, and in some cases can even slow the progression of aortic aneurysms. We wanted to understand the impact statin use has on surgical outcomes when repairing this type of aneurysm.\"\n\nVogel's research team reviewed nearly 20,000 cases where patients either had open surgery or an endovascular repair - a minimally invasive procedure that uses a catheter to access the aneurysm. The team then identified patients who took cholesterol-lowering medication before surgery.\n\n\"Our research showed that patients who took statins before either open or minimally invasive interventions had better outcomes compared to those who did not take statin medications,\" Vogel said. \"The patients who took statins and had endovascular repairs had a 26 percent decrease in mortality up to one year after surgery. Patients who took statins and had traditional open procedures also did better, but the difference was not nearly as significant as with endovascular repair. The bottom line is that patients who used statins were more likely to survive during and after an elective endovascular procedure.\"\n\nAdditionally, the study showed that statin use also reduced post-surgical complications for patients with other health issues such as peripheral artery disease, a condition that causes arterial blockages of blood vessels in the limbs.\n\n\"This information could be beneficial to patients who are about to have elective endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair,\" Vogel said. \"However, further research is needed to assess the benefits of using statins before surgical repair of other types of aneurysms.\"\n\nThe study, \"The Impact of Preoperative Statin Therapy on Open and Endovascular Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair Outcomes,\" recently was published in Vascular, the official publication of the International Society for Vascular Surgery.\n\nThe MU School of Medicine has improved health, education and research in Missouri and beyond for more than 165 years.

But there are still questions about marijuana\u2019s long-term safety as a pain reliever, he said.\n\nWare and his colleagues recruited 21 adults who were suffering from chronic neuropathic pain after an injury or surgery. Three times a day, for five days, participants took a 25 milligram hit of one of four treatments: marijuana that was 2.5 percent, 6 percent, or 9.4 percent tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or a 0 percent placebo. All patients rotated in random order through the four different treatments, with a nine-day break between each one.\n\nDuring each treatment, participants were asked about their pain, sleep patterns, mood, and overall quality of life.\n\nPatients smoking 9.4 percent THC marijuana reported lower pain scores than when smoking the placebo - on average, 5.4 versus 6.1 on a scale from 0 (\u201cno pain\u201d) to 10 (\u201cworst possible pain\u201d). They also reported that they slept better, and were less anxious and depressed than when they were on the placebo.\n\nWhen smoking marijuana with moderate doses of THC, participants generally reported improved symptoms, but there was no significant difference in their relief from these doses compared to relief from the placebo treatment. There was also no difference in the quality of life or mood scores that participants reported when they were on any of the four treatments.\n\nThe highest dose of THC produced the most side effects, which included headaches, dry eyes, and a burning sensation in the regions where patients had pain.\n\nIn the second, third and fourth rounds of treatment, most - but not all - patients were able to tell when they had been on either the highest THC dose or the placebo. Most patients did not report feeling \u201chigh\u201d at any point during the study.\n\nAbout 1 to 2 percent of adults in the U.S. suffer from chronic neuropathic pain - pain that occurs when nerve fibers are damaged by injury or disease, and lingers even after the original wound has healed.

Their blood pressure also dropped the most of the four groups, a finding that the researchers think may relate to their slightly greater weight loss. Those in the Atkins group also experienced the largest increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL), a protective type of cholesterol.\n\nMost important, the Atkins group did not develop the soaring levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) that some experts have thought might result from eating a diet rich in saturated fat and cholesterol found in fatty cuts of meat, butter and cream. High levels of LDL are a major risk factor for heart disease. The study found that while LDL rose slightly for those in the Atkins group, their blood levels did not differ statistically from the other groups.\n\n\"This is the best study so far to compare popular diets,\" said Walter Willett, chair of the department of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health, because of its size, duration and the small number who dropped out. The findings confirm, he said, that reducing carbohydrates, \"especially those with refined starch and sugar like that found in the U.S. diet, has metabolic benefits.\" It also shows that replacing these carbohydrates with either fat or protein \"can improve blood cholesterol fractions and blood pressure,\" he said.\n\nThe findings \"are pretty much in line with what all the other studies have shown comparing Atkins and low-fat diets,\" said Bonnie Brehm, assistant professor of nutrition at the University of Cincinnati College of Nursing and co-author of two, independent studies of the Atkins diet. \"We have found the same thing with all of our trials.\"\n\nAs for weight loss, the goal that concerns dieters the most, none of the groups managed to shed the large numbers of pounds touted by weight-loss programs and television shows such as \"The Biggest Loser.\"\n\nAll the participants reported eating about 2,000 calories a day when the study began. All also reported having cut their intake -- some by as much as 500 calories per day at two to six months -- but then gradually adding back many of those calories. But as researchers noted, if participants ate as little as they said, all the groups would have lost much more weight.\n\nAt first, the Atkins group lost weight faster. But as in previous studies, the pounds shed began to even out across the four groups. After a year, women in the Atkins group averaged a modest 10-pound loss compared with about six pounds for those in the other groups.\n\nBoth the authors and other weight-loss experts were quick to note that the new findings did not answer the question of what is the best way for most people to shed weight.\n\n\"This isn't a study testing how well you would do if you followed these diets to the letter,\" notes Christopher Gardner, assistant professor of medicine at the Stanford Prevention Research Center and lead author of the study, which appears in tomorrow's Journal of the American Medical Association. \"This is a study that shows what happens if you bought the book and tried to follow\" the diets, as most dieters do.\n\nThe 311 overweight and obese women in the study were randomly assigned to one of the four groups. Each received a book detailing her prescribed diet. For the first eight weeks, the women also attended one-hour weekly group sessions with a registered dietitian trained to explain the diet in detail. Participants received follow-up phone calls and e-mails to remind them of appointments, and they were paid $25 to $75 for each appointment they made.\n\nReactions to the findings were mixed.\n\n\"It's bad science, good publicity,\" said the Zone's Sears.\n\n\"For all practical purposes, the programs all worked about the same,\" said Kelly D. Brownell, director of Yale University's Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity and creator of the Lifestyle, Exercise, Attitudes, Relationships and Nutrition (LEARN) program for weight management, one of the diets studied. The extra four pounds lost by the Atkins group are not very meaningful, Brownell said.\n\nOthers were more critical.\n\n\"This study is seriously flawed, and its conclusions misleading,\" said Ornish, clinical professor of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco. A careful read of the study shows \"no significant difference in weight loss between the Atkins and Ornish or LEARN diets after one year!\" he noted in an e-mail. \"There was significantly more weight loss on the Atkins diet after one year only when compared with the Zone diet. This directly contradicts their primary conclusion.\"\n\nAll low-carbohydrate diets are not necessarily created equal, however. A study last year by Willett and his colleagues in the New England Journal of Medicine found that women on low-carb diets who ate mostly animal fat and animal protein did not reduce their risk of heart disease. But those who ate vegetable forms of protein, such as soy, and fat, such as olive oil, did reduce their risk of heart disease.

This collaboration, which includes a 10-year maintenance service, marks the first multi-room PBT application in the nation\u2019s capital. This will be Hitachi\u2019s fifth PBT system in North America.\n\nThe next-generation system \u201cPROBEAT\u201d, which comes with IMPT (Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy) and cone-beam CT, will have improved spot scanning capability in all 3 gantry-type treatment rooms, along with a fixed irradiation room dedicated to cancer research.\n\nToshiaki Higashihara, President & COO of Hitachi, Ltd. stated that, \u201cWe are greatly honored that Johns Hopkins selected Hitachi as their proton partner. As one of the leaders in cancer research and treatment, the Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center\u2019s philosophy of being at the leading edge of cancer treatment through research and development is very similar to our Social Innovation concept which supports a healthy and secure society through innovative technologies, systems, solutions and services. The proton center at Sibley Memorial Hospital will be an impressive demonstration of industry and academic medicine collaborating to bring a new technology and new cancer treatment modality to Washington, D.C. and the surrounding communities. Thus, we foresee an exciting, long term relationship that will benefit cancer patients and cancer research.\u201d\n\nIn December 2007, Hitachi was the first company in the U.S. to clear FDA Premarket Notification Special 510(k) for the \u201cPROBEAT\u201d system with its spot scanning irradiation technology. Hitachi has delivered the first hospital based spot scanning system in May 2008 and has treated over 1,500 patients to date. The same spot scanning system has already been installed at Nagoya Proton Therapy Center and Hokkaido University in Japan. In fiscal year 2015 (ending March 2016), one of Hitachi's new PBT site is planning to start treatment of patients. Hitachi has shown great stability in the proton market through continued investment in research and development, track record for high clinical availability of over 98%, along with a commitment to a long term partnership with all of its clients.\n\nGiven the growing demand for technical and clinical advancements in the treatment of cancer, interest in proton therapy is on the rise, with more and more hospitals and cancer treatment facilities venturing into this area. Hitachi will continue to globally expand the healthcare business where proton therapy is its flagship solution, and contribute to cancer treatment around the world.\n\nProton Beam Therapy (PBT) is an advanced type of cancer radiotherapy. Protons from a hydrogen atom are extracted and accelerated up to 70% the speed of light. Its energy is concentrated directly on the tumor while avoiding radiation dose to the surrounding healthy tissues. PBT improves the quality of life for cancer patients since the patient experiences no pain during treatment and the procedure has very few side effects compared with that of traditional radiotherapy. In most cases, patients can continue with their normal daily activities while undergoing treatment. Because there are fewer side effects, PBT is expected to expand, especially for pediatric treatment.\n\nUnlike conventional scattering technology, spot scanning technology delivers narrow beams to the tumor and the complex tumor shape can be irradiated through repetitive beam delivery with quick position change. Spot scanning technology has been achieved by advancing the uniform quality beam extraction technology from the accelerator and beam control technology with high accuracy. Three primary benefits are: (1) more accurate irradiation which reduces the side effects to healthy tissues surrounding the tumor compared with irradiation from conventional double scattering irradiation; (2) patient-specific collimators and boluses become obsolete, shortening set up times for patients; and (3) high proton beam usage factor reducing unnecessary secondary radiation.\n\nHitachi, Ltd. (TSE: 6501), headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, delivers innovations that answer society\u2019s challenges with our talented team and proven experience in global markets. The company\u2019s consolidated revenues for fiscal 2014 (ended March 31, 2015) totaled 9,761 billion yen ($81.3 billion).

Experts attribute the pelvic pain to prostaglandins, a hormone-like substance that contributes to the contraction and relaxation of muscles and blood vessels.\n\nVitamin D3 apparently helped hamper prostaglandin production in study participants, easing their pain, said Dr. Jill Rabin, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y. The vitamin is also known to have anti-inflammatory effects, Rabin added.\n\n\"The bottom line is, it looked like it worked,\" said Rabin, also head of urogynecology at the hospital. \"It was a very well-done study, but my comment is, it was one study. It asks more questions than it answers, which is the sign of a good trial.\"\n\nThe 300,000 IU dose of vitamin D3 given in the study also far exceeds the daily intake of 600 IUs recommended for American women of reproductive age, both Graham and Rabin said. And since the study period lasted only two months, there was no way to tell whether such a high dose produced any toxic long-term effects.\n\nCurrently used methods of controlling menstrual cramps include NSAIDs and -- among those with severe pain -- birth control pills. But both have potential risks: NSAID users can experience stomach or kidney troubles, for example, while birth control pills are linked to blood clots in certain women. The cost of vitamin D supplements would be roughly comparable with both of these remedies.\n\nVitamin D use has also been widely studied as a possible preventive for many other conditions, including heart disease, certain cancers and autoimmune disorders.\n\nThe Italian study participants all had blood levels of vitamin D measuring in the lowest 25 percent of normal at the study's outset, although the researchers didn't report the womens' blood levels afterward. Experts wondered if women with higher blood levels would experience such dramatic cramp relief as observed in the study.\n\nGraham and Rabin agreed that much larger trials should be done before they would recommend vitamin D3 use to any of their patients for cramp relief.\n\n\"From a symptomatic standpoint, it's something to be considered, but more studies are needed to see the risks and benefits,\" Graham said. \"Studies like this are starting to show that vitamin D is ubiquitous in receptors in our bodies . . . but it needs further explanation.\"\n\nTo find out more about painful menstrual periods, head to the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story could have done a better job on this point.

Although ACE inhibitors were developed 10 years earlier, both types of drugs showed similar effects in the analysis, challenging previous findings that suggest ACE inhibitors have greater benefits.\n\nAccording to the new analysis, published online Jan. 4 in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings, the only difference between the medications is that ARBs are more easily tolerated.\n\n\"There has been debate for many years over the safety and efficacy of ACE inhibitors compared to ARBs, with many of them using an 'ACE inhibitor-first' approach, with ARBs regarded as less effective,\" study author Dr. Sripal Bangalore said in a medical center news release.\n\n\"We believe that our study ends the debate and gives physicians the option to prescribe either drug for their patients,\" added Bangalore, an associate professor in the division of cardiology, in the department of medicine at NYU Langone.\n\nBoth ARBs and ACE inhibitors interfere with the function of a hormone called angiotensin II, which regulates blood pressure, but they do this in different ways, the study authors said.\n\nAngiotensin II restricts blood flow through vessels, raising blood pressure. ACE inhibitors prevent the body from making angiotensin II, while ARBs prevent the hormone from doing its job by taking its place on the surface of blood vessels, the researchers explained.\n\nPrevious studies have suggested that older ACE inhibitors are more effective than ARBs. But, this latest analysis attributed that difference to changes in the standard of care over the decade between trials of the two types of drugs, greater emphasis on quitting smoking, and wider use of cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins.\n\nHowever, when trials were conducted at similar times, one drug was not more effective than the other, the findings showed.\n\n\"This is the first time that we have a clear and consistent message from the three buckets of trials of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, all of which show that there is no outcome difference between the two agents, except for better tolerability of ARBs,\" Bangalore said.\n\n\"The results of our analysis are especially important for patients, given that many ARBs are now also generic, which reduces their costs,\" he added.\n\nFor more about blood pressure drugs, visit the American Heart Association.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story explains that both ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been around for years, the latter since the year 2000 and the former for at least a decade earlier, so readers can easily understand this story is about currently available drugs", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Dr. Scott Faber talks about the plan for an environmental pediatric room at the Children's Institute in Squirrel Hill.\n\nWith childhood autism cases skyrocketing and no cure in sight, doctors at the Children's Institute in Squirrel Hill are planning on a Hail Mary pass approach to the mysterious disorder -- housing young patients for weeks at a time in a pollutant-free \"clean room,\" in an attempt to detoxify their bodies.\n\nNo cause for autism has been found, and debates rage as to whether the brain development disorder is purely genetic or caused in part by environmental factors, including air and food-borne chemicals.\n\nWith roots in autism treatment theories that until now have lived mostly on the Internet, the pediatric clean room plan would be the first of its kind in a mainstream American hospital environment.\n\nThe Children Institute's Scott Faber, a pediatrician with several hundred autistic patients and a waiting list six months long, is one of the believers in toxic causes, and the institute is trying to back him with a multimillion dollar test of the novel theory.\n\nUnder the plans -- developed with help from Duquesne University -- autistic patients would live for more than six weeks in a 1,000-square-foot room kept mostly free of harmful chemicals and pollutants, using special air-filtering systems, ultraviolet lights and air locks on doorways.\n\nFurniture, paints, toys and floor coverings would be designed to be toxin-free, and food, clothing and water organic and clean. Doctors would seek to rid patients' bodies of chemicals and boost their immune systems through natural means such as nutritional supplements and dietary changes.\n\nBasically, it would be pushing a \"reset\" button on the child's body, with the hope of wiping autistic symptoms away.\n\n\"What we would like to do is have kids live in this wonderful environment where they are exposed to almost none of the Industrial Revolution. And we wonder, if the chemicals come out and the heavy metals come out, will the children start improving?\" Dr. Faber said.\n\n\"Will they start showing signs of clinical improvement, such as language improvement and socialization improvement? Will they become less obsessive? Less fascinated?\"\n\nAutism is one of a group of developmental disabilities disorders that cause substantial impairments in social interaction and communication and are characterized by unusual behaviors and interests. Many people with these disorders also have unusual ways of learning, paying attention and reacting to sensation. Rates have greatly increased in recent years, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, though some of the rise may be due to changes in reporting and diagnosing the disorder.\n\nPlanning and fund-raising for the \"Environmental Pediatric Room\" is in the early stages, with the Alcoa Foundation awarding an initial $200,000 grant April 28. It will require an estimated $500,000 to fully design and at least $1 million in yearly operating support its first three years.\n\nThe 106-year-old Children's Institute (formerly called the Rehabilitation Institute) plans to fund the room through the $30 million capital campaign it launched in 2005, after buying out its Shady Avenue site from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. It completed an expansion last year that doubled its building space and its capacity, from 39 to 82 beds. Almost $24 million of the campaign total has been raised, with fund-raising for the clean room and other programs ongoing.\n\nClean rooms are common in high-tech manufacturing and research environments and have been used in hospital settings for patients struggling with infectious diseases and transplants. They have also been used to treat children with autism, but only in patients' homes, largely in work by Virginia researcher and nutritionist Karen Slimak.\n\nDr. Faber noted that Ms. Slimak's clean room work -- like much of the research on toxicity in autism -- \"hasn't been written for the main [scientific] literature\" but instead has been written mostly for the Internet. The Children's Institute plan would be taking what is arguably a fringe movement into the mainstream: It would be the first autism treatment of this kind staged in an American hospital setting. It will be matched with scientific analysis, sensors and video cameras to study the real impacts of detoxification. The data and findings will be shared openly, he said.\n\nWith so many doubts -- and so few answers -- about effective autism treatments among the growing community of families affected by the condition, the institute said openness is vital to the experimental method's success.\n\n\"We're not saying this is the full cause\" of autism and related illnesses, Dr. Faber said. \"Obviously there are multiple causes, and there are going to be found many genetic causes, many environmental causes and many genetic-environmental interactions. But we wonder -- we speculate -- that it's possible if we have children living in a unique environment that has not [previously] been created scientifically that we can make a difference.\n\n\"We want to have it be very transparent to the world what we're doing. We want this to be basically an intellectual exercise that's shared with everyone.\"\n\nEducational, physical, speech and behavioral therapies have long been the traditional treatments for autism, but a growing number of families and researchers have called for further biomedical treatments as well, suspecting there is a chemical side to the disorder.\n\nFamilies often say their environmental suspicions about the disorder aren't taken seriously.\n\n\"I can give you a detailed account of how I know that exposure to toxic mold has caused my son's autism. I have been saying it for years and no one believes me. They think I am crazy, even a [Defeat Autism Now doctor] we once saw,\" said a message posted by a parent on the AutismWeb.com bulletin board in March\n\nParents \"research anything they can get their hands on and there are so many things saying 'Try this or try that' that aren't necessarily safe. It's a frightening thing,\" said Kim Aburachis, of Peters, who has twin 10-year-old boys, Nathan and Tyler, with severe cases of autism. Her boys have seen Dr. Faber for more than seven years and are likely to take part in the clean room treatment.\n\n\"We're so excited, so enthusiastic, just for the hope of this,\" she said.\n\nElliot Frank, the chairman of Pittsburgh's Advisory Board on Autism and Related Disorders, said the proposed clean room should not raise any red flags. Even if it does not work, patients will be in a safe and professional environment, benefiting from passive treatments such as nutrition and clean air.\n\nAmong parents of children with autism, Mr. Frank said, \"some will say, 'Come on, who are you kidding?' But a significant portion of parents will feel good about this and watch this with incredible interest. Others will watch and say, 'Hmm, let's see what happens.' \"\n\nDr. Faber, 49, is a neurodevelopmental and developmental behavioral pediatrician with 24 years in the field, who came to the institute four years ago from Mercy Hospital. He has been working on the clean room concept for at least two years, alongside Duquesne University chemistry professor and environmental expert Skip Kingston.\n\nHe has been trying to build the scientific case that environmental factors such as toxic chemicals do trigger autistic symptoms. His findings are complicated, but basically blood tests show 70 percent of his autistic patients have zinc deficiencies (pointing to problems with processing heavy metals), and the vast majority also have immune system problems of varying kinds.\n\n\"We know that the data for this is just emerging, but we feel it's a very safe intervention, and it's empowering for families and very reasonable,\" he said.\n\nThe room would house only one patient at a time and be similar to other spaces at the institute's Center for Autism, with educational and play spaces, and a table for dining. Medical staff, teachers and family would have regular access to the room through an air-locked entrance, and another air lock would separate the room from a kitchen and laundry area. There will be a small bedroom for the child and a couch for a family member to stay overnight.\n\nTraditional therapies would continue during the patient's stay. But by exposing children to a clean atmosphere and toxic-free diet, doctors will also try to slowly release chemicals from the children's bodies, through their skin, urine and stool. In the meantime they will be living in a space that is anything but hospital or scientific-feeling.\n\n\"To parents and children it's going to be the opposite of a sterile environment. It's going to be home,\" Dr. Faber said. \"If it's not beautiful and it isn't nurturant, it doesn't fit our research plans.\"\n\nAt the outset, patients would be only the sickest children, who have not responded to other treatments. They would stay six to 12 weeks, allowing an estimated four to six children to be treated per year. (Twenty families have already expressed interest.) After leaving, spaces at each patient's home would be equipped with lower-level clean technology, such as ultraviolet lights and air filters, and children would continue with special diets.\n\nA six-week stay is not uncommon at Children's Institute, said president and chief executive officer David Miles, as patients with traumatic brain injuries, often from car or bike accidents, can stay for months at a time. The average stay in its acute care unit is 23 days.\n\nStill, he said the room poses some unique challenges.\n\n\"Talking to architects, the technology to create the room is out there. It's not really a problem,\" Mr. Miles said. \"It's really what you put in the room that is an issue.\"\n\nEquipment and gear for use in industrial clean rooms are easy to find, but educational materials, toys and normal-looking furniture are not. Most will have to be fabricated from scratch, using the help of students at Duquesne's Bayer School of Natural and Environmental Sciences and other research teams. The institute also has to start from scratch on government permits, insurance issues and other red tape.\n\nFund-raising is the most obvious challenge facing the proposal. There is also the worry of raising expectations too high.\n\n\"We want to explore this hypothesis thoroughly,\" Dr. Faber said. \"But we can't promise we'll make any biologic difference or any kind of physiologic difference. What we want to do is to create a loving, nurturant environment where the kids are a gift to us and we're a gift to them, and it all works very nicely.\"\n\nFirst published on May 11, 2008 at 12:00 am", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The pollutant-free \"clean room\" experiment, designed to attempt to detoxify the bodies of young patients with autism, is in the conceptual\u00a0and fund-raising stages, which have\u00a0yet to be completed.\u00a0 This article does not indicate that the\u00a0experimental protocol will not likely be implemented in the near future and that it will not be available to autistic children who are not enrolled in the research study.

Brennan, MD, study author and Chief Medical Officer, CVS Health. \"Our research shows that home infusion care is a promising model that is both cost- and clinically-effective and is overwhelmingly preferred by patients when intravenous therapy is required.\"\n\nResearchers conducted a systematic review of existing peer-reviewed research evaluating infusion care for several conditions, including cystic fibrosis, antibiotics following orthopedic surgery and several cancers requiring infused chemotherapies. Researchers compared measures of quality, safety, clinical outcomes, quality of life and costs of home infusion services to those provided in medical settings. The research showed that patients receiving intravenous therapy at home had as good or better clinical outcomes as those patients who received the same therapy in a traditional health care setting. In addition, patients overwhelmingly preferred receiving their infusion therapies at home, reporting fewer disruptions in personal schedules and responsibilities. The costs associated with home infusion were also consistently lower than services provided in a health care facility, with savings ranging between $1,928 and $2,974 per course of treatment.\n\n\"At CVS Health, we provide important home infusion services to patients through Coram, which is just one of the ways we are expanding our clinical delivery model and helping to move important health services to lower cost sites of care,\" added Alan Lotvin, MD, Executive Vice President, CVS Specialty. \"In fact, our patients report high satisfaction with our Coram home infusion services, citing convenience and comfort as key elements that improved their overall experience.\"\n\n\n\nHome infusion services are a rapidly growing delivery model in the health care system with rising rates of chronic and acute conditions that require intravenous therapy. Despite this, clinical outcomes and quality of care have not previously been systematically evaluated. While many commercial health plans provide comprehensive coverage for home infusion services, Medicare has limited reimbursement for this type of care, and Congress is discussing how to implement a comprehensive home infusion benefit for Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nCoram, a service provided by CVS Health, provides vital infusion care and support to tens of thousands of Americans each month with a range of conditions including immune deficiencies, rheumatoid arthritis and serious infections requiring intravenous antibiotic therapy.

They range from patient demands to malpractice fears to financial incentives and doctors\u2019 own lack of understanding of the risks and benefits of screening.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of pressures,\u201c said Dr. Gerald L. Andriole, a urologic surgeon at Washington University. \u201cIt is not all pure data that is promoting aggressive screening.\u201d Dr. Andriole is directing a National Cancer Institute study of 76,000 men that failed to find a screening benefit after 10 years. The men were aged 55 to 74 when the study began. P.S.A. screening is controversial at any age. Screening proponents say the cancer institute study was flawed and point to a European study of 162,000 men aged 55 to 69 that showed a 20 percent drop in the prostate cancer death rate with screening.\n\nScreening critics say the European study was flawed and add that there is a logical reason it has been hard to show a screening benefit.\n\nThey note that prostate cancer is a common cancer, found in most men\u2019s prostates on autopsy, although often the men had no idea they had it. The cancer can be lethal, but it usually grows so slowly that men die with it, not because of it.\n\nFor most men, screening only has harms because it leads to biopsies and treatments with unpleasant side effects. And, they say, it might not help cure many deadly prostate cancers because those cancers may have already spread outside the prostate, microscopically seeding other organs, long before a P.S.A. test indicates a possible problem.\n\nA positive P.S.A. test usually leads to a biopsy and then, if cancer is found, to a decision about whether to treat it. Nearly all men opt for treatment, which includes surgery to remove the prostate or radiation to destroy the cancer. Side effects can include impotence and incontinence.\n\nEven younger men should weigh the harms of screening, says Dr. Lisa Schwartz of Dartmouth Medical School. \u201cYou also have the potential to wreck their lives,\u201d she said.\n\nOne reason treatment is the most common choice is that it is hard to know if a cancer is lethal. Pathologists can distinguish between cancers that look particularly aggressive and those that do not, but there is a real possibility that even if tissue obtained at a biopsy has only less aggressive tumor cells, more aggressive cells might still be lurking in the prostate.\n\nBut even with this uncertainty, prostate cancer specialists say, most men who are treated would not have died of prostate cancer, and that is especially true for elderly men, in particular those who are frail and have a limited life expectancy. Yet changing medical practice can be difficult.\n\n\u201cAnytime a practice becomes ingrained, it is difficult to eradicate,\u201d says Dr. Brooks. \u201cIt is harder to get rid of an aberrant behavior than to adopt a new one.\u201d\n\nDr. Andriole said the very concept of not screening is difficult.\n\n\u201cIt is the hardest thing in the world not to look for a cancer and not to treat it,\u201d he says. And doctors, he added, have many inducements to screen. They often are afraid they could be sued if they do not screen and a man is found to have a lethal cancer. And there are financial incentives.\n\n\u201cUrologists make money by finding ways to biopsy men and administer treatments,\u201d Dr. Andriole said. Screening, he added, \u201cis promoted by hospitals and industry.\u201d And, he added, \u201cmany patients demand it.\u201d\n\nDr. Brooks of the cancer society says he travels the country and talks to primary care doctors about screening, and has learned that many have misconceptions about the test\u2019s benefits.\n\n\u201cThey often don\u2019t appreciate the downside of screening,\u201d Dr. Brooks said, \u201cand they don\u2019t appreciate the delay in benefit.\u201d In addition, Dr. Brooks said, primary care doctors often \u201coverestimate the likelihood that early detection of prostate cancer will lead to survival benefits.\u201d\n\nAdded to that, Dr. Brooks said, is the length of time it takes to discuss the pros and cons of screening with patients. Often it is easier to just order the test.\n\nDr. Bruce Roth, a professor of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis, said that ideally, a doctor should take a man\u2019s overall health into account and not just go by age in ordering P.S.A. tests. But if a man has been screened year after year, it can be hard to suggest he stop because he may not live much longer.\n\nSome men say the cautions just do not apply to them.\n\nJ. Allen Wheeler, who is 82 and lives in Portland, Ore., said he had his most recent P.S.A. test in January. His doctor orders it routinely, he says, adding, \u201cIn all honestly, it\u2019s part of my physical.\u201d His doctor \u201cjust does it \u2014 that\u2019s the understanding between us.\u201d\n\nMr. Wheeler, who says his health is \u201cfairly good,\u201d said he could not foresee a time when he would stop having the test. He would like to know if he has cancer, he says, although he may decide not to be treated.\n\nA 75-year-old Connecticut man said he had the test because he was healthy and wanted to stay that way.\n\n\u201cI think I am going to live to be 100,\u201d he said, asking that his name be withheld to protect his privacy. A recent P.S.A. test found a small cancer, and he does not want to take a chance that it will grow slowly and not cause him problems.\n\n\u201cI am thinking seriously of having the whole thing taken out,\u201d he says. \u201cHasta la vista.\u201d", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "It\u2019s clear from the story that \u2018routine\u2019 PSA testing is readily available.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "There was a time when the optimal exercise speed was however fast you had to run to get away from a saber-tooth tiger. Even today, in much of the developing world, people exercise through activities such as farming and fetching water that are necessary for survival.\n\nHowever, in the developed Western world, where exercise tends to be an extracurricular activity, there is apparently tremendous interest in just how fast you should move in order to improve your health. Consider, for example, the many posts on The New York Times\u2019 Well blog on the topic (walking versus running, the \u201cright dose of exercise,\u201d \u201cwalk hard, walk easy\u201d), all of which focus on the relative benefits of walking versus jogging versus running.\n\nSo is it better to walk? To walk fast? To run slow? To run fast? On its face, this question is poorly posed, since it says nothing about our goals or our constraints. Am I aiming to lose weight? To live longer? To win road races? Am I willing to exercise for three hours a day? Twenty minutes? Almost never? Clearly, these considerations matter when trying to determine the optimal speed. Here is how I would think about asking the question instead: What is the easiest way to reduce my chance of death?\n\nTo analyze the impact of walking or running, researchers need a way to describe the effort exerted. The ideal measure would combine the length of time spent exercising with the amount of energy expended \u2014 basically, we want to figure out a way to credit people who walk at half the speed for twice as long the same amount as those who walk faster for less time.\n\nThe way researchers do this is with a measurement known as MET \u2014 metabolic equivalent of task \u2014 which gives a numeric value to various activities depending on their energy intensity. By multiplying an activity\u2019s METs by the time you engage in it, you can get an overall measure of how much energy you expend.\n\nThe goal here is to use these METs and their relationship to health to analyze the value of walking compared with jogging or running. At least in this article, I won\u2019t say anything about other kinds of exercise \u2014 no yoga or SoulCycle \u2014 though these have their own MET measures.\n\nLet\u2019s first look at the results from two papers \u2014 here and here \u2014 that relate energy expenditures from walking (in MET hours per day) to the risk of death.\n\nDoing this analysis is a little complicated. You can\u2019t look at the relationship between exercise and the chance of ever dying, because ultimately everyone dies. Instead, these studies look at whether exercise changes the risk of death at a given time. But since the people in the studies are of different ages, researchers can\u2019t just look to see whether they have, say, a 2 percentage point lower risk of death in a given year, since that lower risk would mean a lot more for someone who is 30 than for someone who is 90. Results in these two papers \u2014 and basically all the others we\u2019ll look at here \u2014 therefore report their results in \u201chazard ratios.\u201d A hazard rate of 0.90, for example, means a 10 percent reduction in the risk of death. If there is a 10 in 1,000 chance you\u2019ll die in the next year without exercise, this means by exercising you\u2019d reduce that chance to 9 in 1,000.\n\nThis research shows that those who walk have a lower risk of mortality relative to people in the comparison group, who don\u2019t walk for exercise at all (they probably do still walk some, just not for exercise). This risk of death is lower even with a very minimal energy expenditure. The lowest-energy-expenditure group in each study is walking at about 3 mph for 20 to 40 minutes per day. In other words, a mile or two of walking. In exchange, their risk of death goes down by 10 percent.\n\nWalking a bit farther \u2014 say, 2 to 3 miles at 3 mph \u2014 gets you an additional death reduction of about 30 percent. But walking more than that, or more than an hour a day at this speed, is no better.\n\nOther studies of walking find similar magnitudes. A large meta-analysis found that, on average, walking 1 to 3 miles at about a 20-minute-mile pace results in a reduction in death risk of about 10 percent.\n\nMany of these studies do not separate out speed and duration, but to the extent they do, it seems like walking faster may be better than walking slower. Here is one study that shows large mortality reductions for fast walking even for short periods, and here is another showing that very slow walking has fewer benefits than faster walking.\n\nAt first glance, it may seem obvious that the harder you exercise, the better. If walking faster is more energy-intensive than walking slower, and running is more energy-intensive than walking, it seems like the health benefits of running would be even greater. In some sense, you\u2019d hope so, since most of us find running more difficult than walking.\n\nBroadly, over some range, this seems to be right. The chart below shows results for two studies of runners that, again, relate METs to hazard rates of death. Running \u2014 even slowly, like 5 mph \u2014 is far more energy-intensive than walking. An energy expenditure of 1.19 METs per day (the lowest-energy-expenditure group in the second study here) means about 20 minutes of running a 12-minute mile, three times a week.\n\nSlow running like this appears to have a much larger impact on mortality than walking. A hazard rate of 0.48 \u2014 compared with a sedentary group \u2014 suggests a much larger reduction in the risk of death than a hazard rate of 0.90. What is a bit surprising about this chart is that running faster or farther doesn\u2019t seem to reduce death rates any more than running slowly and, in fact, in both cases is slightly worse.\n\nIn one of these studies it looks like running very intensely (faster than an eight-minute mile, more than four hours a week) increases your risk of death relative to not running at all. But a closer look at the data suggests that this is probably just a statistical artifact: This intense running group contains only 36 people and two deaths, versus hundreds of people in the more casual running groups.\n\nEven if we dismiss the possibility that running harder is worse, it is probably useful to note that running harder or farther doesn\u2019t seem to be better. I have occasionally felt guilty about my thrice-weekly 25-minute runs, especially in comparison to my brother, who runs a 2:45 marathon and once attempted the Leadville Trail 100. It is comforting to know that I can still outlive him.\n\nOne general problem with all of this research is that none of these studies is randomized. People who exercise are different from those who do not, and those who exercise more are different from those who exercise less. This should, as usual, give us some pause in trumpeting the virtues of exercise. However, I\u2019d argue that the comparisons the studies make among runners are still valid.\n\nTo be more concrete: In most of these studies, the more intense runners are healthier (for example: less likely to smoke and thinner) than the less-intense runners. We may tend to attribute the health of this group to their running habits. The fact that even with this bias we see no large benefit \u2014 indeed, seemingly no benefit at all \u2014 to running more rather than running less reinforces the value of moderate running.\n\nIf we take this research at face value, we learn a few things. First, some exercise reduces your risk of death. Second, the optimal walking/jogging exercise is light to moderate jogging. The optimal speed is between 5 and 7 mph, and if you do 25 minutes about three times a week, you\u2019re all set. Nothing in the data suggests that running more \u2014 farther, or faster \u2014 will do more to lower your risk of death.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Most people are aware that walking, jogging and running are exercise options.

The researchers were able to identify people with melanoma with 79% accuracy and people without a melanoma with 84% accuracy.\n\n\"In order for it to be valued by clinicians we would need to get to 90% accuracy in detection,\" she said. \"So we are doing a clinical trial with 1000 participants to refine our test to get to this point.\"\n\nIf further trials are successful, Ziman estimates the test could be distributed internationally in up to five years.\n\nPatients who returned a positive result would still need a biopsy to confirm the blood test and determine how far the cancer had developed, Ziman said.\n\nThe Australian team believe theirs would be the first to detect melanoma.\n\n'In the wrong place with the wrong skin color'\n\nMelanoma cancers are dangerous, abnormal growths on the surface of the skin caused by sun damage, which can spread throughout the body if left untreated.\n\nThe problem is particularly serious in Australia, where melanomas were the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer in 2017 and cause about 1,700 deaths a year, according to the university.\n\n\"We're in the wrong place with the wrong skin color. We've had a lot of migrants from European nations, so they're fair-skinned ... and we do have a very intense sun here,\" Ziman said.\n\nIf detected early, skin cancers have a survival rate as high as 95%, the research team said, but it drops to just 50% if diagnosed late.\n\nSurgery to remove the growth is the most common form of treatment.\n\nZiman said current methods of melanoma detection are expensive and invasive, involving a trip to a clinician, who must biopsy the lesion to discover whether it is cancerous.\n\nFor potential sufferers in remote areas, away from skin specialists, diagnosis can be especially tricky, he said, making a simple blood test an easy alternative to identify those at risk.\n\nOver three years, the research team identified a combination of 10 types of antibodies that best signal the presence of a melanoma.\n\nAntibodies are the products of the body's immune system, created to battle not only bacteria and viruses but abnormal cancer cells, Ziman said.\n\nDr. Jodie Moffat, head of early diagnosis at Cancer Research UK, agreed that a test which finds melanoma earlier could help reduce deaths from the disease, adding that \"melanoma can be more than skin deep, and it's much harder to treat when diagnosed at a late stage after it has spread.\"\n\nHowever, she stressed the fact this new test has not undergone clinical trials.\n\n\"We need to know how accurate it is, if it can save lives, and how it could work in practice.

The company says this is a major step forward in treating PAD because, unlike stents, atherectomy \"leaves no metal behind.\"\n\nA stent is a tiny metal wire mesh tube that props open an artery and is left there permanently. But in leg arteries, the active flexing can cause a stent to break. Being able to clear the blockage just as well without stents reduces possible complications and gives greater flexibility to doctors later, said Brian Verrier, vice president and general manager of peripheral vascular for Covidien.\n\n\"This particular product plays very strongly into where we see the market going,\" he said. \"The potential is huge.\"\n\nAtherectomy is only used in about 15 to 20 percent of PAD cases, but Dr. Lawrence Garcia, a principal investigator in the study, said he expects that to change with these results.\n\n\"I think it has the potential to increase business for Covidien,\" Garcia, chief of interventional cardiology and vascular interventions at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Boston, said Thursday.

They float around in the mother's bloodstream and can be picked up by blood tests.\n\nHowever, a new blood test \u2014 which is still experimental and not yet available outside of a research lab \u2014 can pick up on gene activity in the body that suggests a pregnancy is at risk for preterm delivery, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Science . The researchers also found a similar type of blood test could determine gestational age, which is used to calculate the due date of the baby. Currently, gestational age is calculated in the first trimester using ultrasound, and it's not that accurate if used later in pregnancy.\n\nPregnancies are usually about 40 weeks, and a premature birth is when a baby arrives three or more weeks early. This happens in about 9% of all deliveries and it can be seriously risky for the infant ; they can have all kinds of complications, including lung problems, brain hemorrhages, and infections.\n\nThe scientists analyzed 20,000 genes to find the ones that were active during pregnancy and labor.\n\nThey identified seven cfRNAs that seemed to be associated with premature birth, and in a test of 38 women, they found that they could predict premature birth up to two months in advance.\n\nAll the women were at risk for premature labor because they had early contractions or a previous preterm delivery, and 13 did indeed go on to have a premature baby.\n\nIn a subgroup of women, the test accurately classified 4 of 5 preterm deliveries as being at-risk, and incorrectly suggested that 3 of 18 women who had a full-term pregnancy were at risk for early labor.\n\nIn a test of 31 healthy pregnant women, testing for nine cfRNAs seemed roughly as accurate as an ultrasound at measuring gestational age. An ultrasound has a 48% accuracy rate at predicting a due date that's within two weeks of a baby's actual birth, while the blood test was 45% accurate. The test, if it does turn out to work in clinical trials, would be cheaper than ultrasound, said Quake.\n\n\"It might be tens or hundreds of dollars, rather than thousands,\" he said.\n\nThere's a lot more work to be done before these tests becomes available, including clinical trials.

The test is administered like a tuberculin skin test (TST), and results are interpreted by measuring the size of the skin induration two or three days later.\n\nThe TST is the most commonly used test to detect TB infection, with about 50 million tests worldwide each year, according to the World Health Organization. The test is easy to administer but produces too many false positives to achieve the WHO's goal of reducing TB deaths by 95 percent and new cases by 90 percent by 2035, Dr. Ruhwald said.\n\nIntroduced a decade ago, IGRAs have high specificity, producing few false positives, but require blood samples and complicated lab work, which has limited their widespread use. There is also a dramatic price difference between the two diagnostic tests. According to Dr. Ruhwald, a TST costs about $2; an IGRA is 20 to 40 times more expensive depending on setting.\n\nIn the first clinical trial, Dr. Ruhwald and colleagues conducted a double-blinded study of C-Tb in 979 participants enrolled at 13 clinical trial sites in Spain. Participants, all adults, ranged in TB status from presumed uninfected through intermediate and high risk of latent TB to active disease.\n\u2022 Both C-Tb and the IGRA had a specificity of 97 percent.\n\u2022 C-Tb was highly concordant to IGRA in 95 percent of study participants.\n\u2022 The specificity of C-Tb, unlike the TST, was not impacted by the BCG vaccine, the partially effective vaccine that many residents in the developing world receive. TST specificity in this group was only 62 percent.\n\u2022 The sensitivity of C-Tb was comparable to the IGRA in confirmed TB cases (77 percent vs. 81 percent), indicating similar abilities to detect infection.\n\nIn the second double-blinded trial, researchers were primarily concerned with testing how accurate C-Tb was in HIV-positive patients and in young children--populations in which the accuracy of the TST and the IGRA is known to be compromised. The study, conducted in South Africa, enrolled 1,090 participants, including 299 patients with HIV and 402 children as young as 28 days.\n\u2022 Among participants with HIV, the ability of all three tests to detect TB infection was diminished, though the C-Tb appeared more robust in HIV-infected participants with low CD4 T cell counts.\n\u2022 Among children under 5, C-Tb was comparable with the other two tests in identifying those infected.\n\nDr. Ruhwald said another advantage of C-Tb is that the measurement of infection, a 5mm or larger induration, is universal across patients with different risk factors, including HIV infection. With TST, the size of the induration is often adjusted to increase its accuracy in measuring infection in different patient populations.\n\nRegulatory approval for C-Tb is currently being sought and Statens Serum Institute is actively seeking a commercial partner for marketing of C-Tb. The cost of a C-Tb test is to be determined; however, it is expected to be significantly less than an IGRA.\n\nDiagnostic Accuracy of the Novel C-Tb Skin Test for Latent M.tuberculosis Infection; Results from Two Phase III Clinical Trials \n\nM.

C-Tb combines the field friendliness of the PPD-based Tuberculin Skin Test (TST), with the high specificity of the interferon gamma release assays (IGRA).\n\nThis presentation outlines the results from two recently completed phase III trials (TESEC-05 and -06). The results have not previously been published or presented.\n\nThe TESEC-06 trial included 979 participants from 13 clinical trial sites in Catalonia, Galicia and Basque Country (Spain) with various risk profiles of M.tuberculosis infection. The TESEC-05 trial included 1090 participants with symptoms of TB and 100 endemic controls from Cape Town (South Africa).\n\nIn both trials C-Tb and TST were administered in a double-blinded fashion to one or the other forearm. Skin indurations were read 2 to 3 days later. A reading ?5mm was considered positive for the TST and C-Tb (cut off preset in phase II). Blood for IGRA testing (Quantiferon, QFT-GIT) was drawn prior to skin testing.\n\nThe safety profile of C-Tb was acceptable and not different from TST. Test specificity was assessed in 212 presumed unexposed Spanish controls. Here, C-Tb had comparable specificity to QFT-GIT (both 97%, p=1.0, and there was no impact of BCG vaccination). By contrast, previous BCG vaccination subverted TST specificity [62% (67/108) in BCG vaccinated compared to 95% (99/104) in BCG unvaccinated persons; (p<0.001)]. Sensitivity of C-Tb and QFT-GIT was comparable in patients with confirmed TB [77% (235/307) vs 81% (250/307); p=0.08]. In contacts, mirroring the findings with QFT-GIT, there was a strong trend in increasing C-Tb test positivity with M. tuberculosis exposure (figure 1). The impact of age and HIV infection on C-Tb, TST and QFT reactivity was assessed in 1090 individuals with symptoms suspect of TB disease, analysis is ongoing and will be included in the presentation.\n\nThese phase III trial results demonstrate that C-Tb is safe, has comparable diagnostic performance to QFT-GIT and addresses the problem of false positive TST results in BCG vaccinated persons.\n\nThe field-friendliness and high specificity offered by the C-Tb test could allow for improved targeted treatment of M. tuberculosis-infected persons in also in resource-constrained settings, where IGRAs are too complicated to implement.", "question": "Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The release informs readers that the test still faces a regulatory and commercial path, which strongly implies it is not yet available: \u201cRegulatory approval for C-Tb is currently being sought and Statens Serum Institute is actively seeking a commercial partner for marketing of C-Tb.

This finding could lead to the first advance in the treatment of calcium oxalate stones in 30 years.\n\nJeffrey Rimer, associate professor of chemical engineering at the University of Houston, was lead author of the study, published Aug. 8 in the online edition of Nature. The work offers the first evidence that the compound hydroxycitrate (HCA) is an effective inhibitor of calcium oxalate crystal growth that, under certain conditions, is actually able to dissolve these crystals. Researchers also explain how it works.\n\nThe findings are the result of a combination of experimental studies, computational studies and human studies, Rimer said.\n\nKidney stones are small, hard mineral deposits that form inside the kidneys, affecting up to 12 percent of men and seven percent of women. High blood pressure, diabetes and obesity can increase the risk, and the reported incidence is on the rise.\n\nPreventive treatment has not changed much over the last three decades. Doctors tell patients who are at risk of developing stones to drink lots of water and avoid foods rich in oxalate, such as rhubarb, okra, spinach and almonds. They often recommend taking citrate (CA), in the form of potassium citrate, a supplement that can slow crystal growth, but some people are unable to tolerate the side effects.\n\nThe project grew out of preliminary work done by collaborator John Asplin, a nephrologist at Litholink Corporation, who suggested HCA as a possible treatment. HCA is chemically similar to CA and is also available as a dietary supplement.\n\n\"HCA shows promise as a potential therapy to prevent kidney stones,\" the researchers wrote. \"HCA may be preferred as a therapy over CA (potassium citrate).\"\n\nIn addition to Rimer and Asplin, authors on the paper include Giannis Mpourmpakis and his graduate student, Michael G. Taylor, of the University of Pittsburgh; Ignacio Granja of Litholink Corporation, and Jihae Chung, a UH graduate student working in Rimer's lab.\n\nThe head-to-head studies of CA and HCA determined that while both compounds inhibit the growth of calcium oxalate crystals, HCA was more potent and displayed unique qualities that are advantageous for the development of new therapies.\n\nThe team of researchers then used atomic force microscopy, or AFM, to study interactions between the crystals, CA and HCA under realistic growth conditions. According to Rimer, the technique allowed them to record crystal growth in real time with near-molecular resolution.\n\nChung noted that the AFM images recorded the crystal actually shrinking when exposed to specific concentrations of HCA. Rimer suspected the initial finding was an abnormality, as it is rare to see a crystal actually dissolve in highly supersaturated growth solutions. The most effective inhibitors reported in the literature simply stop the crystal from growing.\n\nIt turned out that Chung's initial finding was correct. Once they confirmed it is possible to dissolve crystals in supersaturated solutions, researchers then looked at reasons to explain why that happened.\n\nMpourmpakis and Taylor applied density functional theory (DFT) - a highly accurate computational method used to study the structure and properties of materials - to address how HCA and CA bind to calcium and to calcium oxalate crystals. They discovered HCA formed a stronger bond with crystal surfaces, inducing a strain that is seemingly relieved by the release of calcium and oxalate, leading to crystal dissolution.\n\nHCA was also tested in human subjects, as seven people took the supplement for three days, allowing researchers to determine that HCA is excreted through urine, a requirement for the supplement to work as a treatment.\n\nWhile Rimer said the research established the groundwork to design an effective drug, questions remain. Long-term safety, dosage and additional human trials are needed, he said.\n\n\"But our initial findings are very promising,\" he said. \"If it works in vivo, similar to our trials in the laboratory, HCA has the potential to reduce the incidence rate of people with chronic kidney stone disease.\"", "question": "Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The release notes that, like citrate, hydroxycitrate is available as a dietary supplement.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today permitted marketing of the first blood test to evaluate mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), commonly referred to as concussion, in adults.

TBI is caused by a bump, blow or jolt to the head or a penetrating head injury that disrupts the brain\u2019s normal functioning. Its severity may range from mild to severe, with 75 percent of TBIs that occur each year being assessed as mTBIs or concussions.

Levels of these blood proteins after mTBI/concussion can help predict which patients may have intracranial lesions visible by CT scan and which won\u2019t. Being able to predict if patients have a low probability of intracranial lesions can help health care professionals in their management of patients and the decision to perform a CT scan.

By contrast, two of those over 50 did, and late-stage polyps were almost twice as common in this age group.\n\nTo find a late-stage polyp, which may or may not turn into cancer, the researchers calculated they would have to test 23 of the people who were in their 50s.\n\nThat number was the same in younger people who had large waistlines, and even lower in those with metabolic syndrome, a combination of risk factors including belly fat, high blood pressure and high blood sugar.\n\n\u201cIt may be reasonable to offer colonoscopic screening to these individuals,\u201d Dr. Sung Noh Hong and colleagues write in the journal Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.\n\nOne gastroenterologist said the results were \u201cimportant\u201d but should not change practice.\n\n\u201cThis paper substantiates what we suspected, that people who are obese have higher risk of colon cancer,\u201d Dr. John Allen, a colon cancer expert and a community practice counselor with the American Gastroenterological Association, told Reuters Health.\n\nAllen, of Minnesota Gastroenterology PA, said this risk factor might be taken into consideration when deciding when to screen, but that so far more studies were needed before recommending colonoscopy at younger ages.\n\nDuring colonoscopy, the doctor inserts a slim, flexible tube into the rectum. A camera at the tip shows the inside of the gut, so that unusual cell clumps can be found and removed.\n\nAt this point, colon cancer screening is only recommended by the American Cancer Society and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in people under 50 if a first-degree relative developed cancer at a young age.\n\nIn younger people, it is unclear that the benefits of screening offset the risks. During widely used colonoscopy, for instance, bleeding or perforation of the colon may happen in rare cases.\n\n\u201cYou want to make sure that the advantages are going to outweigh the harms,\u201d said the American Cancer Society\u2019s Smith.\n\nColonoscopy, used in millions of Americans every year, is just one of many methods to detect abnormalities. There are cheaper methods such as testing stool for blood, Dr. Michael L. LeFevre, of the University of Missouri in Columbia, told Reuters Health.\n\nLeFevre, a member of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federally appointed expert panel, said the chances that a polyp turns into cancer is currently a matter of debate. As a result, he said, it is hard to know whether removing polyps in younger people would in turn lower their risk of getting cancer.\n\n\u201cIf we back screening down to age 45, does that affect mortality?\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a task force perspective, this article alone would not prompt us to look at the screening guidelines.\u201d", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Clearly colon cancer screening is available.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Robert Bush has multiple sclerosis (MS), which sapped his ability to walk five years ago. Joseph McGlynn suffered a stroke that seriously impaired his left side, also five years ago.\n\nUsing technology designed by Case Western Reserve University and the Advanced Platform Technology and Functional Electrical Stimulation centers at the Louis Stokes Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center, the two men got their feet back under them.\n\nTwo studies, published in the American Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, show that functional electrical stimulation (FES) significantly helped McGlynn and Bush to effectively walk at the medical center.\n\n\"I went in there and I could barely take two steps,\" said Bush, 42, who researchers believe is the world's first MS patient to \"test-drive\" an implanted FES system. The proof-of-feasibility test lasted 90 days. \"At the end,\" said Bush, of Columbus, Ohio, \"I was walking down the hallway. To me, it was monumental.\" A video of him walking with and without the system can be found at: https:/ .\n\nMcGlynn, 69, of North Royalton, Ohio, could walk with a cane, but not easily. With the technology switched on, he covered far more ground and his pace was twice as fast during his 30-week study.\n\n\"It's helped with balance and confidence,\" said McGlynn, who used to tread a lot of stairs maintaining equipment at a steel plant. \"I'm confident now that I can walk without stumbling and falling.\" A video of him walking with and without aid of the system can be found here: https:/ .\n\nNathan Makowski, an investigator at the Cleveland FES Center, created by Case Western Reserve and the Cleveland VA, said that FES technology has been used primarily for therapy in stroke patients in the past. \"This, though, is a more long-term assistive system,\" he said.\n\nThe researchers hope these studies will lay the foundation for implanted systems that restore some independence to people with MS or who have suffered a stroke.\n\nTheir numbers are substantial. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society estimates that more than 2.3 million people have the disease worldwide. Surveys have found that 93 percent suffer gait impairment within 10 years of diagnosis and 13 percent report they are unable to walk twice a week. Other research has found that 6 million to 7 million people live with stroke nationally and nearly 30 percent require assistance to walk.\n\n\"In both cases, there is a disconnect between the brain and muscles,\" said Stephen Selkirk, MD, a neurologist at the VA's Spinal Cord Injury Division and assistant professor of neurology at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine. \"This system replaces the lost connection.\"\n\nThe system includes implanted electrodes that tie into nerves that control muscles collectively, called hip and knee flexors and ankle dorsoflexors. In healthy people, the muscles work in seamless coordination each step they take.\n\nWhen Bush or McGlynn walks, he pushes a button on an external controller, which sends signals to a pulse generator, which then sends electrical pulses to the electrodes. The pulses stimulate the nerves, which in turn stimulate the muscles in both of Bush's legs and McGlynn's left leg.\n\n\"Both guys were taking steps the first time we turned the systems on,\" said Ron Triolo, a professor of orthopaedics and biomedical engineering at Case Western Reserve and executive director of the Advanced Platform Technology (APT) Center. \"When Robert Bush took a step, it wasn't' pretty, but we saw the potential.\"\n\nIn each patient, \"the pulses are sent in a pattern that is close to how normal muscles work,\" said Rudi Kobetic, a principal investigator at the Stokes Cleveland VA and APT Center. \"We try to time the pattern to stimulation so that it's integrated with their ability. Similar to regular physical therapy, we can see results.\"\n\nBoth men gained strength and endurance through repeated use of the systems and fine-tuning by the researchers.\n\nBush went from the two steps to consistently walking more than 30 yards during the trial. In that time, he used a walker to help maintain his balance.\n\n\"When they turned it on the first time, I was surprised how well it worked,\" said Bush, who had to give up his construction career due to the disease. \"I lifted my knee like I was high-stepping. Once we got it fine-tuned and I got walking, I thought it was amazing. I still think it's amazing.\"\n\nMcGlynn's gait became noticeably more symmetrical and energetic, the researchers said. His gait without the system was about 19 yards per minute; with the system, 47 yards per minute. Training with the system improved McGlynn's speed when it was turned off to 23 yards per minute, indicating therapeutic benefit.\n\n\"Distance is a challenge,\" he said. Initially, he could walk 83 yards but improved to 1,550 yards--nearly a mile--at the faster gait. \"I work up a good sweat and that makes me feel good,\" he said.\n\nDue to his improvements, the research team is developing a system that McGlynn can use at home and outside.\n\n\"I'll be able to walk for exercise and hopefully be able to walk into church and into a restaurant,\" McGlynn said.\n\nWhen Bush's trial ended, surgeons removed his implanted electrodes. The researchers are seeking funding to fit him with a permanent FES system in a clinical trial.\n\nIn the meantime, Bush is now back to using a wheelchair but working to maintain his strength and flexibility, repeatedly standing and sitting while holding onto a rail or standing for long periods of time. \"I'm keeping things ready for when they get the green light,\" he said.\n\nOther researchers who contributed to the two studies are the APT Center's Lisa Lombardo, physical therapist; Kevin Foglyano, biomedical engineer; and Gilles Pinault, MD, a surgeon and co-director of the center.", "question": "Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "We would have liked to see discussion of what hurdles this technology must overcome to be made available to the general patient population, as well as what types of patients might stand to benefit.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Please use our search feature and update your bookmarks.

A new study identifies patterns of communication that can help couples affected by Alzheimer\u2019s maintain a sense of connection, which could improve quality of life for both partners.\n\nPrevious research on communication in couples affected by Alzheimer\u2019s has tended to focus on deficits, said study author Christine Williams, professor and director of the PhD in Nursing program at Florida Atlantic University\u2019s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing. Identifying patterns that help couples maintain their bond could make it easier for caregiving spouses to find meaning and improve satisfaction with their marriage.\n\n\u201cNo one is looking at it from the perspective of what these couples are doing right, what is helping,\u201d said Williams, whose findings were published in the International Journal for Human Caring. \u201cSome past research has involved a caregiver giving directions and seeing if his or her spouse [with Alzheimer\u2019s] can follow. A relationship is obviously so much more than that.\u201d\n\nMembers of Williams\u2019s research team visited 15 couples in their home once a week for 10 weeks. The couples, who were recruited from a day program for people with memory disorders and their spouses, were receiving coaching in communication, with caregivers learning to listen, to avoid arguing, to not treat their spouse like a child. Twice during the 10 weeks, the couples were asked to discuss a topic of their choosing while the researcher left the room. A total of thirty 10-minute conversations were recorded.\n\nIn analyzing the recordings, Williams identified 10 communication patterns that caregiving spouses used to connect with their partners and show affection. These patterns showed the caregivers applying what they\u2019d learned through coaching in creative ways, she said. They included sharing news about friends or relatives or plans for the day as a way to involve their spouse in day-to-day events; waiting patiently and keeping eye contact while spouses searched for words; and finding alternate ways to communicate \u2014 for example, singing songs together when attempts to engage the spouse in certain topics failed.\n\nThe caregiving spouses seemed to value their partners\u2019 efforts to communicate as much as or more than the actual content of their conversations. They were willing to listen to stories they had heard before, and resisted correcting their partners\u2019 versions of past events. This showed that they \u201cvalue the relationship more than being right,\u201d Williams said.\n\nSome of the caregivers did voice frustration or tried to teach their partners information they had forgotten. Future research might focus on interventions that could help diffuse these frustrations, the paper noted. Yet Williams hopes that the more supportive and positive communication patterns that many of the caregivers showed will help nurses coach spouses and family members affected by Alzheimer\u2019s. Previous research has found that communication decline among people with dementia is a significant source of stress to caregivers, and most say they need education about communication.\n\n\u201cThe reality is, a person with dementia isn\u2019t going to have a dramatic breakthrough and remember things forgotten,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAt the same time, people with Alzheimer\u2019s do have moments of clarity or show affection when it\u2019s unexpected.

Patients with large-vessel occlusions can then be routed to a Comprehensive Stroke Center with endovascular capabilities. In contrast, a standard physical examination achieved only 40 to 89 percent accuracy in identifying patients with large-vessel occlusion who could benefit from endovascular therapy.\n\nThe volumetric impedance phase shift spectroscopy (VIPS) device (Cerebrotech VisorTM, Cerebrotech Medical Systems, Pleasanton, CA) works by sending low-energy radio waves through the brain that change frequency when passing through fluids. Such waves are reflected back through the brain and then detected by the device. When a patient is having a severe stroke, the brain's fluids will change, producing an asymmetry in the radio waves detected by the VIPS device. The greater the asymmetry, the more severe the stroke.\n\nEndovascular therapy within 24 hours is the standard of care for emergent large-vessel occlusion, but the chance of achieving a good outcome decreases by approximately 20 percent for each hour that passes before treatment.\n\nThe researchers hope that the device will save valuable time -- especially important in stroke where time is brain -- when it is deployed with emergency medical personnel in the field. This is because the accuracy of the device simplifies the decision made by emergency personnel about where to take patients first, according to Raymond D. Turner, M.D., professor of neurosurgery and chief of the Neuroscience Integrated Center of Clinical Excellence at MUSC. Turner served as principal investigator for MUSC in the VIPS for the Non-Invasive Detection of Hemispheric Bioimpedance Asymmetry in Severe Brain Pathology (VITAL) study reported in the article.\n\n\"Transfer between hospitals takes a lot of time,\" said Turner. \"If we can give the information to emergency personnel out in the field that this is a large-vessel occlusion, that should change their thought process in triage as to which hospital they go to.\"\n\nIn the study, the VIPS device was deployed with emergency medical personnel in regions served by five Comprehensive Stroke Centers equipped with the endovascular capabilities to treat large-vessel occlusions that underlie severe stroke. Their goal was to use the device to accurately identify severe stroke and then compare the results to established physical examination methods practiced by emergency personnel such as the Prehospital Acute Stroke Severity Scale.\n\nBoth healthy participants and patients with suspected stroke were evaluated by emergency personnel using the VIPS device. Three readings were taken and averaged -- a process that takes about 30 seconds. Patients were also later evaluated by neurologists who provided definitive diagnoses using neuroimaging.\n\nCompared to the neurologists' diagnoses, the device displayed 92 percent specificity -- the ability to detect the difference between patients with severe stroke and those with other conditions such as mild stroke or healthy participants with no brain pathology. This places the VIPS device above standard physical examination tools used by emergency personnel that display specificity scores between 40 and 89 percent.\n\nThe VIPS device is made by Cerebrotech Medical Systems, which paid consultants to analyze the neuroimaging data independently. The neuroimaging data was needed to teach the VIPS device which radio waves were indicative of stroke. Yet the consultants did not have access to the VIPS radio wave data during their review of the images, thereby eliminating the potential of the consultants to choose data that might artificially inflate the device's accuracy. It is also not clear how the device would work for patients with cranial implants, as metal interferes with the device's operating radio frequencies.\n\nThe device's success may be found in its ability to give emergency personnel a clear answer as to whether a patient is experiencing a severe stroke. The VIPS device requires very little training to operate compared to that required to learn standard emergency examination skills, thereby reducing the possibility of human error during emergency diagnosis.\n\nIn their next steps, the researchers are undertaking the VITAL 2.0 study to determine if the VIPS device can use complex machine learning algorithms to teach itself how to discriminate between minor and severe stroke without the help of neurologists. If so, the VIPS device could have widespread clinical implications, helping emergency personnel decide whether to take a patient to a comprehensive stroke center or a primary stroke center for treatment.\n\nTurner likens the use of the VIPS device in detecting severe stroke to the use of electrocardiography (ECG) to definitively detect acute myocardial infarction. He predicts that the device has the potential to be used widely by emergency personnel but also to appear in other public spaces. \"This could potentially be something like a defibrillator,\" said Turner. \"You can find out if a patient is having a stroke, just like you can put a defibrillator on a patient to see if they're having a heart attack.\"\n\nThis study was funded by Cerebrotech Medical Systems.\n\nAbout MUSC Founded in 1824 in Charleston, The Medical University of South Carolina is the oldest medical school in the South.

The study is available online in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology \u25cf Biology \u25cf Physics, the flagship journal of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO).\n\nWith brachytherapy, also known as internal radiation therapy (RT), implants are surgically inserted in or near cancerous tissue to deliver a curative radiation dose directly to the tumor while limiting exposure for surrounding healthy tissue. Reducing this exposure is of particular concern for treating tumors in the prostate, which is surrounded by multiple critical structures. In contrast to low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy, where radioactive seed implants are placed permanently in the body and gradually deposit low levels of radiation over a period of months, HDR treatments deposit the dose in one treatment, after which the radioactive implant is removed from the patient.\n\nTypically, HDR brachytherapy is administered in four to as many as nine treatment sessions, which generally requires multiple invasive procedures to insert the implants. While the number of sessions can be streamlined by increasing the dose given in each session, data on the safety and tolerability of highly escalated brachytherapy doses are still relatively new and therefore limited. In this study, researchers found that patients who received a single fraction of 19 Gy HDR brachytherapy experienced similar clinical outcomes as with LDR brachytherapy, but with the convenience of a single visit.\n\n\u201cIt is becoming apparent that patients may be treated definitively for their prostate cancer in as little as a single day with a minimally invasive outpatient procedure,\u201d said lead study author Daniel J. Krauss, MD, a radiation oncologist at Oakland University\u2019s William Beaumont School of Medicine in Royal Oak, Michigan. \u201cWe found that patients generally can resume normal activities the following day with typical side effects.\u201d\n\nThe study, which appeared in the Red Journal\u2019s January 2017 issue, presented the results of a nonrandomized, prospective clinical trial of 58 patients with low- or intermediate-risk (non-metastatic) prostate cancer, with a median follow-up period of 2.9 years. All patients received a single, 19 Gy fraction of HDR brachytherapy. The median patient age was 63 years (range 43-73), and 91 percent of the patients presented with stage T1 disease.\n\nAt an average of nearly three years following treatment, cancer control rates were favorable and the toxicity profile was highly favorable. Three patients experienced recurrence or progression, yielding an estimated three-year cumulative biochemical control rate of 93 percent. Within the six months following HDR therapy, seven patients (12.1%) experienced grade 2 urinary side effects, most commonly frequency/urgency (6.9%). No patients experienced short-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 2+ gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Rates were similarly modest for long-term side effects. Six patients (10.3%) experienced chronic grade 2 urinary toxicity and one patient (1.7%) experienced grade 3 chronic GI toxicity that subsequently resolved. No patients experienced long-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 4 GI toxicity.\n\n\u201cThis study illustrates that a potentially curative dose of radiation may be delivered safely to the prostate entirely in a single administration,\u201d said Dr. Krauss. \u201cGiving the entire dose in a single treatment theoretically could have had a greater negative impact on the normal tissues in close proximity to the prostate\u2014meaning the bladder, urethra and rectum\u2014but this was not found to be the case. Toxicity rates were extremely low, with essentially no major complications encountered in this initial group of 58 patients.\u201d\n\nWhile findings highlight the potential tolerability of a single fraction of HDR brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer, the article also emphasizes the need for additional follow-up to compare long-term cancer control rates with conventional treatment approaches, which generally administer larger cumulative doses than the 19 Gy dose used in this trial.\n\n\u201cAs the follow-up interval lengthens, 19 Gy dosing in a single fraction may or may not be sufficient to result in cure rates comparable to historical standards. One thing that this study has made clear, however, is that the extremely low toxicity and complication rates leave room to escalate the single fraction dose in subsequent trials,\u201d said Dr. Krauss. \u201cWhile additional study and longer follow-up are necessary to confirm the optimal dose for single-fraction HDR brachytherapy, we are optimistic that the single-treatment approach can eventually become a standard practice for prostate cancer treatment.\u201d\n\nFor more information or a copy of the full study, contact ASTRO\u2019s media relations team at press@astro.org.

The Oncotype DX DCIS Score result provides patients with an individualized estimate of local (in the same breast) recurrence, which could be either invasive breast cancer or DCIS. This information helps physicians and patients personalize treatment decisions to potentially spare women with low risk of recurrence additional treatment they may not need, while identifying women with a higher risk of recurrence who may need additional treatment after surgery.\n\nConducted in collaboration with Partnership for Health Analytic Research, this prospective study analyzed 115 patients from 10 cancer centers in the United States. The results showed that physician treatment recommendations changed for 31 percent of patients after receiving the DCIS Score result, reducing the number of patients receiving a radiotherapy recommendation by approximately one-third. Importantly, of the patients initially recommended not to receive radiotherapy, 32 percent were identified as having a high risk of recurrence and recommended to have radiotherapy. Physicians in this study rated the DCIS Score as the most important factor in planning treatment compared with pathologic features, patient preference, patient age, comorbidities or consultation with other physicians.\n\n\"The Oncotype DX DCIS Score result was validated in two studies including nearly 900 patients and is the only genomic test for patients with pre-invasive breast cancer,\" said Phil Febbo, M.D., chief medical officer, Genomic Health. \"The publication of this clinical utility study clearly demonstrates that the Oncotype DX DCIS Score can play a key role in enhancing cancer care for patients with DCIS, and we believe that these results will support expanded adoption of and access to the DCIS Score.\"\n\nAbout Oncotype DX\u00ae\n\nThe Oncotype DX\u00ae portfolio of breast, colon and prostate cancer tests applies advanced genomic science to reveal the unique biology of a tumor in order to optimize cancer treatment decisions.

(Table sugar, or sucrose, extracted from sugar cane or sugar beets, is a compound of glucose and fructose.) Researchers also took blood samples to measure levels of glucose, fructose and insulin, and of leptin and ghrelin, enzymes involved in controlling hunger and feelings of fullness.\n\nBefore having their drinks, the participants rated their desire to eat on a one-to-10 scale from \u201cnot at all\u201d to \u201cvery much.\u201d Then they drank the liquids and had functional magnetic resonance imaging brain scans while looking at images of food and of neutral objects like buildings or baskets. As they did so, they rated their hunger using the scale. The volunteers were then presented with images of high-calorie foods and asked whether they would like to have the food now, or a monetary award a month later instead.\n\nThe study, published in the journal PNAS, found that compared with glucose, consuming fructose produced greater responses to food cues in the orbital frontal cortex of the brain, a region that plays an important role in reward processing. The fructose drink also produced greater activity in the visual cortex when volunteers looked at images of food, a finding that suggests increased craving compared with glucose.\n\nWhen choosing between tasty high-calorie food or a delayed monetary reward, fructose drinkers were more likely than glucose drinkers to choose the food.\n\nThere was no difference in leptin or ghrelin levels between fructose and glucose drinkers. But plasma insulin response was sharply lower in fructose drinkers, which may affect what we eat, according to the senior author, Dr. Kathleen A. Page, an assistant professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California.\n\n\u201cInsulin is released when we consume glucose,\u201d she said. \u201cThe pancreas secretes insulin, and insulin drives glucose into cells so that it can be used for energy. But it also sends a signal to the brain that says \u2018you\u2019ve eaten.\u2019 Fructose doesn\u2019t stimulate insulin secretion, and if there\u2019s no insulin, you don\u2019t get the information that you\u2019re full.\u201d\n\nDoes this mean that it is a good idea to avoid fruit, because it contains fructose?\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Dr. Page said. \u201cDon\u2019t stop eating fruit. It has a relatively low amount of sugar compared with processed foods and soft drinks \u2014 maybe 5 grams in an orange, compared with 25 grams in a 12-ounce can of soda. And it is packed with fiber, which helps slow down the absorption of food, which makes you feel full.\u201d\n\n\n\n For more fitness, food and wellness news, \u201clike\u201d our Facebook page.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Not relevant to this story.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "TUESDAY, Aug. 17, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Less invasive biopsies done with the help of imaging to guide the needle now make up the majority of biopsies being done, a new study finds.\n\nIn fact, the use of these minimally invasive biopsies increased from 59 percent to 67 percent of all biopsies between 1997 and 2008, a trend which is likely to continue, one expert noted. A biopsy involves the removal of tissue or fluids to test for disease.\n\n\"Doing image-guided biopsy allows more definitive diagnosis and shorter hospital stays,\" said Dr. Robert Quencer, chair of radiology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, who was not involved on the study.\n\nIn addition, image-guided biopsies are more accurate, Quencer said. \"This is a trend throughout the whole country. I doubt there is any variation to this in any major medical center.\"\n\nThe report is published online and in the September print edition of Radiology.\n\nFor the study, a team led by Dr. Sharon W. Kwan, a radiology resident at the University of California, San Francisco, looked at biopsies done among Medicare patients from 1997 through 2008.\n\nDuring that time, the number of biopsies increased from 1,380 per 100,000 in 1997 to 1,945 per 100,000 in 2008.

For these areas, open biopsies are easier to do and need less imaging guidance, Kwan's team noted.\n\nQuencer thinks the use of image-guided biopsies will continue to increase over time, even for lymph nodes and soft tissues. \"In time, I would expect 80 to 90 percent of biopsies will be image-guided biopsies,\" he said.\n\nFor more information on biopsies, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The availability \u2013 and growing use of \u2013 less invasive biopsies is the whole point of the story.

These are early results, but if replicated may mean that treatment of some mental health problems could benefit from the inclusion of dietary advice. This is presented at the ECNP Conference in Barcelona.\n\nBipolar Disorder (which used to be called 'manic depression') is characterised by episodes of mood swings, between being very up or very down with periods in between the two extremes. The fact that there are two opposite sets of symptoms means that finding an effective treatment is difficult. While current medications are useful, they are better at targeting mania symptoms (the 'up' phase), leaving a lack of effective treatment for people experiencing depressive episodes. Now a group of Australian, German and American scientists have shown those who have a high quality diet, a less inflammatory diet, and/or a low BMI (Body Mass Index) may respond better to an add-on nutraceutical treatment provided as part of a clinical trial.\n\n\"If we can confirm these results, then it's good news for people with Bipolar Disorder, as there is a great need for better treatments for the depressive phase of Bipolar Disorder\" said lead researcher Melanie Ashton of Deakin University in Australia.\n\nA total of 133 participants were randomly assigned to take a combination of nutraceuticals (compounds derived from foods such as vitamins or minerals that treat or prevent a disease or disorder) including the anti-inflammatory amino acid n-acetylcysteine (NAC), or NAC alone, or a placebo (a dummy pill) for 16 weeks. Participants received the study medication in addition to any stable treatments they were already receiving. Researchers measured BMI at the beginning of the study, and then measured depression and how a person is able to function in their day to day life. Researchers also rated whether a participant was improving and, if so, how much, over the next 20 weeks. Participants filled in a questionnaire about what they usually eat over the year and researchers calculated a diet quality score, where good diets included a healthy diet with lots of fruit and vegetables, whereas poorer-quality diets had more saturated fat, refined carbohydrates and alcohol. These types of diets were then categorised as either anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory based on foods that affect inflammation.\n\nMelanie Ashton continued, \"We found that people who had a better-quality diet, a diet with anti-inflammatory properties, or a lower BMI, showed better response to add-on nutraceutical treatment than did those who reported a low-quality diet, or a diet including foods that promote inflammation, or who were overweight.\n\nWhat this means, if these results can be repeated in a larger trial, is that treatment for Bipolar Disorder would need to take into account what a person eats and their weight.\n\nThere are some points we need to note about this study. This is a randomised, controlled trial, but what we found were exploratory outcomes; in other words, it wasn't the main result that we were testing. Our result is statistically significant, but because the study wasn't specifically designed to test the effect of diet quality,\n\ninflammatory diets and BMI on drug response in general, it is necessary to see the work replicated in a larger study before any firm conclusions can be formed\".\n\n\"This is interesting work, which holds out the possibility that patients with Bipolar Disorder may benefit from a balanced diet.

It provides an image that has been magnified more than two times, the FDA says in a news release.\n\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a condition that affects older people. It damages the center of the retina, or macula, and results in a loss of vision in the center of the visual field. There are two forms of AMD, a wet form and a dry form.\n\nAbout 8 million people in the U.S. suffer from this condition, and nearly 2 million of them already have significant loss of vision.

The third in a series of studies from the Andersen lab involving PD and low-dose lithium, the results add to mounting evidence that low-doses of the psychotropic drug could benefit patients suffering from the incurable, degenerative condition.\n\nThis study, published online in Brain Research, involved Parkinsonian mice that were given Carbidopa/Levodopa (sold as Sinemet\u00ae), a drug used to boost levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is lost in PD. While the medication remains the single most effective agent in the management of PD symptoms, long-term use causes its own side effects, among them abnormal involuntary movements or AIMS. Buck professor and senior scientist Julie Andersen, PhD, says AIMS become problematic for 30 percent of patients after four to six years of treatment with Sinemet, with 90 percent of patients suffering from the complication after nine years of chronic use. \"For patients these side effects are just as devastating as the freezing that is associated with PD.\" \"In our mice we saw significant behavioral improvement.\"\n\nIn this study, Andersen and her team dosed the mice with an amount of lithium equivalent to about a quarter of what humans receive for the treatment of psychiatric diseases. Researchers found that lithium boosted the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase which increases dopamine synthesis via the inhibition of calpain-1, an enzyme that normally reduces dopamine synthesis.\n\nIn earlier studies, Andersen's team found that low-dose lithium was protective in two different mouse models of PD. Treatment in mice with a human mutation for PD began when the animals reached late middle-age, the human equivalent of about 60, which is the average age of onset of Parkinson's in humans. \"We clearly saw a prevention of the motor difficulties we would expect to see in the animals,\" said Andersen. \"The treatment also protected the area of the brain that is normally damaged by Parkinson's.\"\n\nPlans for a clinical trial of low-dose lithium for PD patients are in early stages. \"This study suggests potential therapeutic benefit in PD,\" said David K. Simon, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Simon chairs the Scientific Review Committee for the Parkinson's Study Group, a not-for-profit network of Parkinson's Centers. \"One caveat is that other agents that have shown clear efficacy in this model of PD have subsequently failed to show benefit in clinical studies in PD (e.g. CoQ10, creatine, and pioglitazone). However, this study provides additional evidence on top of prior work from Dr. Andersen's lab and others that lithium may have therapeutic potential in PD, which is a hypothesis that should be tested in clinical trials,\" he said.\n\nLithium is a naturally occurring element, not a 'developed' molecule like most medications. It was approved by the FDA for the treatment of bipolar disorder in 1970 and has shown to be effective for treating mood disorders and suicidal thoughts.

But a milestone study with results published today in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that clot removal up to 24 hours after stroke led to significantly reduced disability for properly selected patients.\n\nThe international multi-center clinical study, known as the DAWN trial, randomly assigned 206 stroke victims who arrived at the hospital within six to 24 hours to either endovascular clot removal therapy, known as thrombectomy, or to standard medical therapy.\n\nThrombectomy involves a catheter placed in the femoral artery and snaked up the aorta and into the cerebral arteries where the clot that is blocking the artery, and causing the neurological symptoms, is retrieved.\n\nAlmost half of the patients (48.6 percent) who had clot removal showed a considerable decrease in disability, meaning they were independent in activities of daily living 90 days after treatment. Only 13.1 percent of the medication group had a similar decrease. There was no difference in mortality or other safety end-points between the two groups.\n\n\"These findings could impact countless stroke patients all over the world who often arrive at the hospital after the current six-hour treatment window has closed,\" says co-principal investigator Raul Nogueira, MD, professor of neurology, neurosurgery and radiology at Emory University School of Medicine and director of neuroendovascular service at the Marcus Stroke & Neuroscience Center at Grady Memorial Hospital.\n\n\"When the irreversibly damaged brain area affected by the stroke is small, we see that clot removal can make a significant positive difference, even if performed outside the six-hour window,\" says co-principal investigator Tudor Jovin, MD, director of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Stroke Institute. \"However, this does not diminish urgency with which patients must be rushed to the ER in the event of a stroke. The mantra 'time is brain' still holds true.\"\n\nTo select patients for the trial, the researchers used a new approach which used brain imaging and clinical criteria as opposed to just time alone.\n\n\"Looking at the physiological state of the brain and evaluating the extent of tissue damage and other clinical factors seems to be a better way to decide if thrombectomy will benefit patients as opposed to adhering to a rigid time window,\" says Nogueira.\n\nThe researchers planned to enroll a maximum of 500 patients over the course of the study period.

Results from the Phase 2 study, reported in the Journal of Neurosurgery on Dec. 18, 2015, demonstrated the safety of DBS in Alzheimer's patients.\n\nA neurosurgical procedure in which an implanted neurostimulator delivers electrical signals to specific areas of the brain to help regulate abnormal signals, DBS is currently only approved in the U.S. for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and essential tremor. However, its use is being researched for a number of conditions, including epilepsy, depression and bipolar disorder. Francisco Ponce, MD, Director of the Barrow Center for Neuromodulation, believes there are potential applications for Alzheimer's disease - the most common form of dementia - as well. Whereas in Parkinson's disease and essential tremor, the target for the electrodes are nodes within the motor circuits, the Alzheimer's study targeted the fornix, which is part of the memory pathway.\n\n\"There are more than five million Americans living with Alzheimer's, and yet there are few promising pharmacologic treatment options for this progressive disease,\" says Dr. Ponce. \"Previous pilot studies researching the use of DBS in Alzheimer's have indicated the potential to slow cognitive decline in some patients, and have even shown metabolic changes in the brain that may slow the progression of the disease.\" Barrow Neurological Institute is part of Dignity Health St. Joseph's Hospital in Phoenix.\n\nThe ADvance Trial, using a device from Functional Neuromodulation, Inc., is aimed at evaluating the safety, efficacy and tolerability of DBS in this patient population.

Now a study published in the journal Circulation confirms and quantifies that benefit; women who ate three or more servings of blueberries and strawberries per week reduced their risk of heart attack by up to one third.\n\nIn the study, researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health and the University of East Anglia in the U.K. analyzed data from 93,600 women ages 25 to 42 enrolled in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study II. For 18 years, the women filled out surveys detailing their diets at four-year intervals.\n\nDuring the study the women experienced 405 heart attacks. But women who consumed the most blueberries and strawberries had a 32% reduced risk of heart attack compared with the women who ate berries once a month or less. The women who ate more berries also tended to eat healthier overall, consuming more vegetables and fruits than those who didn\u2019t eat as many berries; but when the scientists broke down the women\u2019s diets, they found that the highest consumers of berries even had a lower risk of heart attack compared with women who still ate plenty of fruits and vegetables but fewer berries. The effect remained even after the researchers adjusted for other things that can influence heart-disease risk, such as obesity, high blood pressure, smoking, low levels of physical activity and a family history of heart disease.\n\n\u201cThese foods can be readily incorporated into diets, and simple dietary changes could have an impact in reducing risk of heart disease in younger women,\u201d says study author Aedin Cassidy from the University of East Anglia. \u201cThis supports growing lab data showing that these compounds can help keep arteries healthy and flexible.\u201d\n\nSo what is it about berries that help the heart? The researchers focused on blueberries and strawberries because these are the most widely consumed varieties in the U.S. Both berries contain high levels of anthocyanins, as well as other flavonoids, which fight the effects of stress and free-radical damage to cells as they age. They can also keep heart vessels more elastic and flexible, which helps combat the growth of plaques that can build up and rupture, causing heart attacks.\n\nThe results are particularly encouraging because they showed that a change in diet could affect heart-disease risk for relatively young women. That means that regular consumption of berries might be a relatively easy way to lower a woman\u2019s risk of having a heart attack later in life, possibly even insulating her from heart problems. \u201cAlthough we know about the effects of antioxidants and flavonoids, and their effects in wine and chocolate, it is interesting to look at their effects in such a large group of women over a long period of time,\u201d says Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, director of women and heart disease at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThe take-home lesson is that even if you are eating these early in life, you\u2019re getting benefits that last for life. When we\u2019re making choices in our 20s, we may think that a burger and fries is great, but the message is that there are alternatives that make a difference for the rest of your life.

In clinical trials, a plant-based diet lowers total cholesterol by 12.5 mg/dL.\n\u2022 In observational studies, a plant-based vegetarian diet is associated with a 22.9 mg/dL reduction in LDL cholesterol and a 3.6 mg/dL reduction in HDL cholesterol, compared to control groups following an omnivorous diet.\n\u2022 In clinical trials, a plant-based vegetarian diet lowers LDL cholesterol by 12.2 mg/dL and reduces HDL cholesterol by 3.4 mg/dL, compared to control groups following an omnivorous, low-fat, calorie-restricted, or a conventional diabetes diet.\n\u2022 A plant-based vegetarian diet is not associated with statistically significant changes in triglyceride levels in observational studies or in clinical trials.\n\nThe authors predict the strong correlation between vegetarian diets and lower cholesterol levels may be due to the association a plant-based diet has with a lower body weight, a reduced intake of saturated fat, and an increased intake of plant foods, like vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, and whole grains, which are naturally rich in components such as soluble fiber, soy protein, and plant sterols.\n\nThe study authors hypothesize that the greater risk reduction for total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol levels observed in the longitudinal studies is likely due to long-term adherence to plant-based eating patterns and changes in body composition.\n\n\"The immediate health benefits of a plant-based diet, like weight loss, lower blood pressure, and improved cholesterol, are well documented in controlled studies,\" says study author Susan Levin, M.S., R.D., C.S.S.D. \"Our goal with studying plasma lipids throughout the lifespan is to capture the net risk reduction of using a vegetarian diet to control lipid levels. We hope to empower patients with new research about the long-term cardiovascular health benefits of a vegetarian diet, which include a reduced risk of a heart attack, stroke, and premature death.\"\n\nCharles Ross, D.O., a member of the nonprofit Physicians Committee and a former emergency department physician, has firsthand experience with putting a plant-based diet into practice.\n\nDr. Ross is in his late 60s, takes no medications, and lowered his previously high total cholesterol from 230 mg/dL to a healthy 135 mg/dL after adopting a whole-food, plant-based diet in 2012. Within the first month of making the dietary change, he effortlessly lost 10 pounds. Within a year, Dr. Ross traded a 34-year career of practicing emergency medicine for a new career path: lifestyle medicine. After 5.5 years of making the career switch, he continues to host free biweekly nutrition classes for his primary care patients and the community. More than 700 people have enrolled to learn how to lose weight, eliminate the need for medications to treat type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and elevated cholesterol, and to simply feel better. His former hometown of Roseburg, Ore., is now a Blue Zones community. He is a part-time instructor at the College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific Northwest and hopes to set an example for future physicians.\n\n\"I no longer work for a living,\" notes Dr. Ross, who now resides in Westfir, Ore. \"I wake up every day eager to hear about how a plant-based diet and a healthful lifestyle is changing and saving lives in our community. What I've found is that if you want your patients to make significant health changes, you have to make them yourself. The prescription started to spread soon after my family, co-workers, neighbors, and friends heard about my experience.\"\n\nFor clinicians concerned about spending extra time in and outside of the exam room, the study authors encourage time-strapped health care providers to refer patients to registered dietitians who can help with the transition to a plant-based vegetarian diet. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans highlights a healthy vegetarian diet as one of three healthful eating plans to follow.\n\nThe study authors also note hyperlipidemia, or elevated cholesterol and triglycerides, is often underdiagnosed and undertreated. A 10 percent increase in the prevalence of treatment for hyperlipidemia can prevent 8,000 deaths each year. Taking small steps, like those proposed by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel 3, which include assessing heart disease risk, making lifestyle and dietary recommendations, and assessing the need for future follow-up appointments and pharmaceutical interventions, could prevent approximately 20,000 heart attacks, 10,000 cases of coronary heart disease, and save almost $3 billion in medical costs each year.\n\n\"To make any form of health care work and to truly power economic mobility, we have to get healthy,\" says Levin. \"The first place to start is by building meals around nutrient-packed, plant-based foods, which fit into nearly every cultural template, taste preference, and budget.\"\n\nTo request a copy of the study or to request an interview with a study author, please contact Jessica Frost at 202-527-7342.\n\nFounded in 1985, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine is a nonprofit organization that promotes preventive medicine, conducts clinical research, and encourages higher standards for ethics and effectiveness in research.", "question": "Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The release notes that registered dietitians can help people transition to a plant-based vegetarian diet.

Newly published research in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition showed that a hearty bowl of instant oatmeal helped curb food intake at lunch better than a leading oat-based, cold cereal -- even when each bowl provided the same number of calories.\n\nThe statistically significant results of the randomized, controlled crossover study (n=47) showed that a 250-calorie instant oatmeal serving (with an additional 113 calories of skim milk) enhanced satiety and feelings of fullness, reduced the desire to eat and may even lead to a lower caloric intake at lunch, compared to a 250-calorie serving of cold, oat-based cereal, also served with an additional 113 calories of skim milk.\n\n\"The satiety benefits of instant oatmeal alone were important findings,\" remarked lead author Candida Rebello, MS, RD, of Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University. \"When we took it a step further and evaluated the intake four hours post-breakfast, we found that after consuming instant oatmeal, the participants chose to eat significantly less at lunch compared to those who ate the oat-based, cold cereal.\"\n\nAfter an analysis of the types of fiber in each cereal, the researchers suspected that the higher molecular viscosity of the beta-glucan in the instant oatmeal contributed to its satiating effect over the oat-based, cold cereal. Authors stated that the processing of the cold cereal might lead to changes in the oat fiber that reduced its ability to enhance satiety.\n\nResearchers presented the participants with a lunch meal of their choice - turkey, ham, roast beef or vegetable patty sandwiches and a calorie-free or calorie-containing beverage, alongside potato crisps and cookies. The lunches offered ranged from 2,600 to 2,800 calories and participants were told to \"eat to satisfaction.\" Total calorie intake was significantly lower following consumption of instant oatmeal compared to the cold cereal, as were fat and protein intake.

HER2 has been established as a therapeutic target in breast cancer, and breast cancers in which the HER2 gene is not amplified do not, in general, respond to HER2-directed therapeutic approaches.\n\nA few years ago, when the research teams of Dr. Matthew Ellis and others carried out a molecular characterization of breast cancer tumors, they found a new mutation in HER2 that was different from gene amplification but also resulted in tyrosine kinase being constantly activated.\n\n\"In this particular activation mechanism, the cells develop a subtle mutation within the functional part of the HER2 gene that activates the enzyme,\" said Ellis, professor and director of the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center, part of the National Cancer Institute-designated Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center at Baylor College of Medicine. \"The mutation locks the enzyme into an 'on' position.\"\n\nEllis and his colleagues developed a preclinical model to study this new HER2 mutation and discovered that the enhanced enzymatic activity could trigger tumor formation. Furthermore, these tumor cells were sensitive to an experimental drug, neratinib. With this information in hand, the researchers took the next step.\n\n\"We launched a phase II clinical trial of neratinib in patients with metastatic breast cancer carrying a HER2 mutation,\" Ellis said. \"Finding patients that are positive for a HER2 mutation required a national collaboration because we had to screen hundreds of patients to identify the 2 to 3 percent that have a tumor driven by a HER2 mutation. The results of the clinical trial were encouraging in that about 30 percent of the 16 patients treated with neratinib had a meaningful clinical response showing significant disease stabilization or regression. Neratinib was well tolerated by most patients.\"\n\n\"This is the first time we had a reasonable number of patients treated for HER2 mutations in whom we could estimate the response rate.\"\n\nThe number of patients who could potentially benefit from this new treatment approach is estimated to be in the thousands. The researchers estimate that as many as 200,000 patients are likely to be living with metastatic breast cancer today in the United States. Based on the estimate that the new mutation is present in 2 to 3 percent of cases, the researchers calculated that approximately 4,000 to 6,000 patients with metastatic breast cancer carry a HER2 mutation and are therefore potential candidates for neratinib treatment.\n\nTo identify the patients in this study who carried the new HER2 mutation, the researchers required tissue from the tumor, a biopsy, from which they could extract and sequence the genetic material to determine the presence of the HER2 mutation. This task turned out to be a major challenge because for 20 to 30 percent of the patients the researchers did not have sufficient material to make the diagnosis.\n\n\"To assist in our ability to identify patients with HER2 mutation-positive tumors, we conducted circulating tumor DNA analysis,\" Ellis said. \"The tumor's DNA is released into the human bloodstream, and we were able to determine the presence of the mutation in blood samples from the patients. Importantly the circulating tumor DNA results were highly concordant with the tumor sequencing results, and they were much easier to determine. Notably, the blood test was sensitive enough that we could use it as a tool to determine eligibility for the clinical trial.\"\n\nIn addition to bringing to the table a novel treatment for metastatic breast cancer carrying a HER2 mutation, the researchers have tested the value of the circulating tumor DNA as a disease-monitoring marker.\n\n\"A circulating tumor DNA-based blood test also could therefore be potentially used to monitor tumor progression and to determine whether patients are responding or not to treatment after just one month of therapy,\" Ellis said.\n\nEllis also is a McNair Scholar at Baylor.\n\nRead all the details of this study, the full list of contributors and their financial support in Clinical Cancer Research.", "question": "Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The release didn\u2019t make it clear that more research is needed following the phase 2 trial.

Cancerous tissue provides a different electromagnetic signature than normal tissue, the researchers explained.\n\n\"This can potentially decrease having to go back to the operating room and with no real effect on your [cosmetic] outcome,\" said study leader Dr. Susan Boolbol, chief of breast surgery at Beth Israel Medical Center, in New York City.\n\nThe study of nearly 500 patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery found little difference in the volume of tissue removed when the device was used compared to traditional detection methods.\n\n\"The reality is, most of the time we leave the operating room and we don't know if we have a clear margin [with all cancer removed] or not,\" Boolbol said. Doctors wait for the pathology report to find that out, which can take a week or two. With the new device, the wait time is about five minutes.\n\n\"Everything still goes through pathology,\" Boolbol said. But the MarginProbe is another tool that might help reduce the odds of needing a subsequent surgery, she said.\n\nBoolbol is scheduled to present the findings Thursday at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's breast cancer symposium in San Francisco.\n\nIn June, the radiation-free device won the blessing of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel. The FDA usually follows the advisory panel's recommendations, so device approval is anticipated.\n\nFor the study, Boolbol and her colleagues randomly assigned 495 breast cancer patients to receive the MarginProbe after lumpectomy or not receive it. Of those, 161 had early cancer known as ductal carcinoma in situ. The others had invasive cancers.\n\nWhere the device detected cancer cells near the edge or surface of the sample examined, surgeons removed additional tissue in the same procedure.\n\nTypically, about 40 percent of lumpectomy patients need another surgery because of the difficulty distinguishing between healthy and cancerous cells in tissue around the tumor.\n\n\"We looked at whether we could lower the [repeat surgery] rate by using this device,\" Boolbol said. The patients were followed for two months to see if they needed a repeat surgery. For those with ductal carcinoma in situ, 13 percent of the probe group needed a repeat surgery, compared to 37 percent of the control group.\n\nAmong women with invasive breast cancer, 17 percent in the device group and 33 percent in the comparison group required more surgery.\n\nLooking at the volume of tissue excised, the researchers said not much more tissue was removed when the device was used compared to tissue removed in the initial and subsequent surgeries among the control-group patients, Boolbol said.\n\nDr. Laura Kruper, director of the Cooper Finkel Women's Health Center and co-director of the breast cancer program at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., said the device looks promising.

The results will be presented in a poster presentation titled Lung EpiCheck \u2122 - Results of the Training and Test Sets of a Methylation-Based Blood Test for Early Detection of Lung Cancer at the IASLC 19th World Conference on Lung Cancer hosted by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, to take place on September 22-26, 2018 in Toronto, Canada.\n\nIn the study, blood was prospectively collected from 20 centers and 3 biobanks in Europe and Israel. The samples were used for detection of lung cancer with the Lung EpiCheck blood test. Lung EpiCheck was validated on this independent test set comprising 181 lung cancer cases and 141 current or former smoker controls. Results show specificity of 91% and a sensitivity of 74% with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 89%. These results demonstrated similar performance to the preceding training set results from 102 lung cancer cases and 265 current or former smoker controls.\n\nIn particular, in the non-small-cell lung carcinoma group (n=162), the most prevalent type of lung cancer affecting about 85% of lung cancer patients, Lung EpiCheck was able to identify correctly approximately 70% of patients.

At the moment, low-dose computerized tomography (LDCT) screening which has been shown to reduce mortality from lung cancer in the very large NLST study is only reimbursed in the US for high-risk individuals. LDCT screening is not reimbursed in Europe or most areas in the world while there is still a debate about its cost and safety. Screening is however necessary in order to identify lung cancer at early, operable, stages for the entire at-risk population so currently, not only CT screening but also methods of molecular screening are being tested. I am therefore very encouraged with the results of this study, showing that EpiCheck has the ability to identify both non-small-cell and small-cell lung cancer at early stages, with a high level of sensitivity and specificity. Such promising results combined with the simplicity of the test, could allow us to detect lung cancer at the early stages and hence improve 5-year survival from about 15% to about 50-70%. This will offer significant added value in the fight against lung cancer.\"\n\n\"We are very excited to present the best published clinically validated results of a blood test for the early detection of lung cancer,\" said Opher Shapira, PhD, CEO of Nucleix. \"Furthermore, these results were validated prospectively in an independent cohort. Currently, early stage lung cancer can be detected either accidentally, when testing for other conditions, or by using low-dose CT scans, which are costly, carry associated risks such as high radiation, and are employed only for a very high-risk population. Early detection of lung cancer can be a game-changer in the fight against this devastating disease, and we are looking forward to begin extensive clinical trials in the US, Europe and China next year, in order to get the test to the market as soon as possible at an affordable price.\"\n\nThe Lung EpiCheck blood test is based on a proprietary molecular biomarker technology, which combines new biochemical assays and sophisticated algorithms. The technology is based on identification and analysis of subtle changes in DNA methylation patterns, a powerful tool for distinguishing between cancer and healthy cells and thus for detection of tumors in the body. Dying tumor cells release cell-free DNA (cfDNA) into the blood, where cancer-specific methylation changes can be detected at any disease stage. The Lung EpiCheck blood test detects changes in DNA methylation in 6 markers in cfDNA associated with lung cancer.\n\nLung cancer is the deadliest and most common of all cancer types. It is estimated that there are about 1.8 million new cases of lung cancer annually worldwide and about 1.55 million die from the disease each year. The reason for the high mortality rate is that currently most cases are detected when the patient becomes symptomatic, which is usually at late stages of the disease. To date, there is no adequate screening process for the early detection of lung cancer, bringing 5-year survival rate to approximately 15%. In addition, there is a well-defined risk group for developing the disease \u2013 mostly smokers and former smokers above the age of 50. In the US, low-dose CT is available for screening of individuals 55-79 years old who smoked at least 1 pack a day for 30 years, which represent less than half of the lung cancer population. Therefore, a screening test aimed at the entire risk group to assist in the early detection of the disease is highly needed and can dramatically increase lung cancer survival.\n\nNucleix Ltd. develops, manufactures and markets innovative, non-invasive, molecular cancer diagnostic tests.

They found that AIM2 deficiency causes uncontrolled proliferation of intestinal cells. Surprisingly, they also discovered that AIM2 influences the microbiota -- the population of gut bacteria -- apparently fostering the proliferation of 'good' bacteria that can protect against colon cancer.\n\nThe team, led by Thirumala-Devi Kanneganti, Ph.D., a member of the St. Jude Department of Immunology, published their findings in a recent issue of the journal Cell. She said that the findings could have important applications for prevention, prognosis and treatment.\n\n'Since reduced AIM2 activity in colorectal cancer patients is associated with poor survival, it might be useful to detect the level of AIM2 expression in polyps taken from colonoscopy and use this as one of the biomarkers for prognosis,' Kanneganti said.\n\nKanneganti and her team believe that it might be possible to prevent the disease or reduce its risk by treating susceptible people to increase AIM2 activity and give them healthy donor bacteria. 'In people who already have colorectal cancer, therapies that boost the expression of AIM2, such as interferons, might reduce tumor progression. Also, transferring healthy microbiota or a group of 'good' bacteria to patients with colorectal cancer at the early stage of disease may prolong survival,' Kanneganti said.\n\nCancer researchers had known that mutations in AIM2 were frequently found in patients with colorectal cancers. And a study by other researchers had found that more than half of small bowel tumors had AIM2 mutations.\n\nHowever, AIM2's established function in the cell was not in the machinery of cancer, said one of the paper's first authors Si Ming Man, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in Kanneganti's laboratory. Rather, he said, AIM2 was known to work in the immune system to detect invading bacteria and viruses and help 'alert' the immune system to battle them.\n\n'When we found that the intestine expressed high levels of AIM2, we hypothesized that this gene may also play a role in regulating gut health,' Man said. 'This was how we became interested in AIM2 and colorectal cancer.'\n\nIn their experiments with mice, the scientists used chemicals to trigger the process mimicking the development of colorectal cancer. They found that the mice showed drastically reduced AIM2 function, confirming the finding in humans with the cancer. They also found that mice genetically altered to have reduced AIM2 function, when treated with the chemicals, showed significantly more tumors than normal mice.\n\nThe scientists' studies also showed that AIM2 played a role independent of its immune role, in suppressing abnormal expansion of intestinal stem cell populations. Conversely, malfunction of AIM2 unleashes abnormal stem cell proliferation. Stem cells are immature cells that differentiate into adult cells such as intestinal cells. These cells continuously proliferate to replace old and dying cells in the intestine.\n\n'Many previous studies have indicated that AIM2 contributes to the immune system by acting as a pathogen sensor,' Man said. 'However, our work is the first to identify AIM2's role in controlling proliferation of intestinal stem cells. This work is truly exciting to us because we have found a new role for AIM2 in regulating colorectal cancer, and it does so by inhibiting excessive proliferation of stem cells in the large intestine.' The researchers also pinpointed the specific cellular machinery regulated by AIM2.\n\nThey decided to explore whether AIM2's protective role might involve gut bacteria, based on studies from Kanneganti's lab and others indicating that microbial sensors similar to AIM2 contributed to healthy gut microbiota. Indeed, the comparison of gut bacteria in normal and AIM2-deficient mice showed a different 'microbial landscape' in the two types of mice.\n\nTo test whether gut bacteria might influence the progression of colon cancer, the researchers housed normal and AIM2-deficient mice together, to enable the exchange of gut bacteria. The scientists found a striking reduction in colon tumors in the AIM2-deficient mice and an increase in tumors in the normal mice.\n\n'What this might suggest is that transfer of some of the 'good' microbiota from wild-type mice to replace the 'bad' microbiota from mice lacking AIM2 offers increased protection against colorectal cancer,' Man said. 'We believe that this finding has important clinical relevance because we can potentially prevent or decelerate the progression of colorectal cancer in humans, especially in those who have mutations in the AIM2 gene, by simply giving them 'good' microbiota.'\n\n'We have only scratched the surface of the role of AIM2 in controlling stem cell proliferation and the maintenance of a healthy gut microbiota,' Kanneganti said. 'How exactly AIM2 does both of these functions is an exciting research area to pursue.'\n\nThe paper's other authors are Qifan Zhu, Liqin Zhu, Zhiping Liu, Rajendra Karki, Ankit Malik, Deepika Sharma, Liyuan Li, R.K.

The study was also published online yesterday by The New England Journal of Medicine and will appear in the Dec. 7 issue.\n\nHer report is the latest warning from researchers who suspect that stents are being overused and may even be causing heart attacks and deaths. Manufacturers sell $6 billion in stents a year, and hospitals charge $10,000 to $15,000 per patient to implant them.\n\nThe devices, which came into widespread use in the 1990s, are made of either bare metal or metal coated with a drug meant to help keep the artery from closing again. Recent studies have found that drug-coated stents can increase the risk of blood clots, even years after they are implanted.\n\nUse of the drug-coated stents has fallen since last spring, but they still account for more than 80 percent of stents implanted in the United States.\n\nStents have been increasingly used in people with clogged arteries who are not having heart attacks, but some studies suggest that those patients would be better off taking drugs to reduce cholesterol, inflammation and clotting. The reasoning is that artery disease tends to be systemic and extensive, but stents can treat it only in tiny spots.\n\nA million Americans a year have heart attacks, and half of them die, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. A common symptom is severe pain in the chest, left arm, jaw or back, but about a third of patients do not have chest pain. Symptoms may also include feeling faint, sweaty, short of breath or nauseated and having a sensation that the heart is pounding.\n\nClots are often the cause of heart attacks, and health authorities urge people with symptoms to go to the hospital immediately so that doctors can use balloons and stents, or clot-dissolving drugs, to try to prevent heart damage. But some patients do not realize what is happening, or do not want to believe it.\n\nAbout a million angioplasties a year are performed in the United States, including those in heart attack victims and those in people with blocked arteries who have not had heart attacks. The study did not address the use of angioplasty and stents in people who have not had heart attacks.\n\nDr. Hochman emphasized that angioplasty was still the best treatment for many heart attack patients who go to the hospital early, within 12 hours of when the attack began. The people who generally do best are those who arrive at the hospital and have angioplasty within 90 minutes of the heart attack.\n\nOpening a clogged artery in the early stages of a heart attack \u2014 \u201cearly angioplasty\u201d \u2014 can restore blood flow and reduce damage to the heart muscle. It can sometimes save the muscle after 12 hours, but then doctors decide case by case whether it is worthwhile. About a third of heart attack patients show up after 12 hours.\n\nAfter a few days have passed, though, there is little or no chance of preventing heart damage. But many doctors open the artery anyway, thinking it may still have long-term benefits and prolong the patients\u2019 lives. In that situation, the procedure is called late angioplasty. It can be helpful in people who are still suffering from chest pain or have certain other complications from the heart attack.\n\nBut what about people who see a doctor more than a day later and are medically stable and free of chest pain? The new study tried to determine if late angioplasty could help them. Although angioplasty is not open surgery, it is an invasive procedure with risks, and the researchers wanted to know if there was any reason to put these patients through it when they seemed to be on the road to recovery. The study showed there was no need for the procedure.\n\nThe findings may come as a rude surprise to many cardiologists, who have come to believe that opening a blocked artery, even days or weeks after a heart attack, is bound to be good for patients.\n\nEven Dr. Hochman was surprised by the results. She said she and her colleagues expected to find that angioplasty would reduce the risks of heart failure, subsequent heart attacks and death. But their theory failed the test.\n\n\u201cThis is why we have clinical trials,\u201d she said. She added that cardiologists were such strong believers in angioplasty that some major medical centers in the United States and Europe had refused to participate in her study, saying it would be unethical to let some patients go without the procedure for a study.\n\nThe 2,166 patients in the study had all suffered heart attacks 3 to 28 days before, caused by a completely blocked coronary artery. The median time since the heart attack was eight days. They were in stable condition and free of chest pain, and were picked at random to receive either heart medicines only or balloon treatment and stents with heart medicines. Most got plain metal stents, but about 8 percent got drug-coated ones. The researchers tracked their health for an average of three years.\n\nThere were no differences between the groups. They had the same rates of heart attack, death and heart failure. If anything, those who had angioplasty seemed to fare a bit worse than those who did not, but the differences were not statistically significant and might have been because of chance, Dr. Hochman said.\n\nAn expert not involved in the research, Dr. Steven E. Nissen, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic and president of the American College of Cardiology, said the study was independent and well conducted.\n\n\u201cHaving an artery open ought to be good for you,\u201d Dr. Nissen said. \u201cWhy not open it late? Like a lot of things in medicine, however, when you actually test it in an organized way, in a randomized, controlled trial, you find out it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt will change what I do.\u201d\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the study in the journal, two other cardiologists say that late angioplasty may still be worthwhile for some patients. The ones who might benefit, they say, are a small minority \u2014 perhaps 10 to 15 percent \u2014 who cannot take the class of heart medicines known as beta blockers, which have been proved to increase survival after a heart attack.\n\nA spokesman for Boston Scientific, the leading stent maker in the United States, said Dr. Hochman\u2019s study would not have much impact because the findings applied to only a small subgroup of patients. But the company\u2019s stock price dropped sharply yesterday morning when news of Dr. Hochman\u2019s study first hit the news. It recovered by the end of the day, however, as analysts said the findings were likely to have little effect on stent use. By late afternoon, the rally had wiped out all the morning losses.

A larger part is at this point, we just don't fully understand what the genetic mechanism that leads to autism is.\"\n\nStandard practice is to offer children with autism two tests as a first-line genetic work-up: karyotype and fragile X testing, the researchers said.\n\nIn karyotyping, forms of which have been around since the 1960s, geneticists use a microscope to look for chromosomal abnormalities that are associated with autism, explained Dr. David Miller, a clinical geneticist and assistant director of the Genetics Diagnostic Laboratory at Children's Hospital Boston, which conducted the new research along with Boston's Autism Consortium.\n\nLike karyotyping, CMA also looks for chromosomal abnormalities, but does so at 100 times the resolution of the earlier test, Miller said. CMA, a genome-wide test, can identify sub-microscopic deletions of duplications of DNA sequences, called copy-number variants, known to be associated with autism, he said.\n\n\"Think of chromosomes as a library full of books and each book as a gene,\" Miller said. \"What we look for are shelves of books that have gone missing, which represent a missing fragment of a chromosome, or extra fragments of chromosome, that could contain genes related to autism.\"\n\nWhile both Children's Hospital Boston and Montefiore have offered CMA testing for several years, not all hospitals do, nor does all insurance pay for it, the researchers noted.\n\nThe main purpose of genetic testing of children with autism is to help parents determine if they're at a higher risk of having another child with autism, Marion said.\n\nIf tests pinpoint an autism-related chromosomal abnormality in the child, the parents are then offered testing. If a parent is also found to have the abnormality, geneticists conclude that the couple is at higher risk of having a child with autism. (The precise risk depends on what the variant is.)\n\nBut if the parents don't have the abnormality, geneticists conclude that the deletion or duplication happened by chance, and the parents are probably not at any greater risk of having another child with autism than the general population, Marion said.\n\nStill, there is much geneticists can't tell parents. Between 10 percent and 15 percent of autism cases can be traced to a known genetic cause, the researchers noted. Of that, CMA alone can detect 7 percent of those.\n\nThere are a few other genetic tests that can explain another few percentage points of autism cases.\n\nBut that leaves 85 percent or more families with little explanation for the disorder, Marion said.\n\n\"CMA is better, but it's not great,\" Marion said. \"The vast majority of children who have autism have no identifiable genetic markers that will help in genetic counseling for future pregnancies.

Patients were tracked from four to 12 years, with a median of 9.2 years. The research builds on a 2006 Lancet Neurology study that followed patients for a median of 5.2 years, beginning with a group of 137 volunteers with mild cognitive impairment.The new study is important because of the long follow-up period, according to Adam Brickman, assistant professor of neuropsychology at Columbia University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research.\n\nKnowing which patient with mild cognitive impairment patients may go on to develop Alzheimer's is vital information for researchers, who are looking for treatments for the fatal brain disease. The current thinking is that interventions will be most effective when given to a patient as early as possible, Brickman said. Clinical trials can better focus their efforts if patients are known to be in the early stages of Alzheimer's. Generally, about 30% to 60% of patients with mild cognitive impairment show evidence of underlying symptoms of Alzheimer's, so not everyone with this condition is a good candidate for an Alzheimer's trial.\n\nResearchers focused on two biomarkers previously thought to be involved in Alzheimer's disease: a kind of protein called beta-amyloid, and another protein type called tau. Experts believe a decrease in beta-amyloid in the fluid of the spinal cord is associated with a toxic buildup of that protein in the brain, which causes the formation of plaques linked to Alzheimer's disease. Tau has been tied to neurofibrillary tangles in the brain; researchers find that an increase in tau in cerebrospinal fluid is associated with Alzheimer's also.\n\nThe results from the study suggest that beta-amyloid is a much earlier predictor of Alzheimer's disease than tau, which supports the hypothesis that beta-amyloid accumulation in the brain occurs first in the course of the disease.\n\nSome of the participants, who were originally found to be stable with mild cognitive impairment after about five years, went on to develop Alzheimer's disease during the longer follow-up. That suggests that a five-year follow-up period is not long enough to determine how well biomarkers can predict which patients will develop Alzheimer's disease, researchers say.\n\nThe association between biomarkers in the fluid and Alzheimer's was also described in studies in December 2009 and August 2010, building on the idea that a spinal tap could be useful in predicting Alzheimer's.\n\nWhen these sorts of studies get published, Brickman and other doctors get phone calls from aging adults wondering whether they should be getting spinal taps to assess their risk. But it's too early to use this as a diagnostic tool in clinical settings, says Brickman. Down the road, the \"fantasy\" is that asymptomatic people will be able to get a biomarker test to determine whether they'll one day get Alzheimer's, but that's not possible right now, he adds.\n\n\"What I tell people is: If they\u2019re worried about their thinking abilities, that they should make an appointment with a neuropsychology or a neurologist to get an evaluation,\" Brinkman says. \"The way we diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s disease is by evaluating the behavior and the risk factor medical profile, not by looking at biological markers at this point.\"\n\nAs scientists gain more insight into predicting Alzheimer's, aging adults may struggle with the question of whether they want to know their risk, especially since there's still no cure. Some people want to enroll in clinical trials as soon as they start showing symptoms; others would rather be ignorant of their status since there is no cure. In looking for treatments, however, researchers depend on people's willingness to contribute to science.\n\nThe Alzheimer's Association runs a system called TrialMatch.

In most cases, the lump or lesion is benign or noncancerous and does not require further treatment.\n\nBiopsies may be performed via open surgery on the breast or with a less invasive core-needle biopsy in which a small sample of breast tissue from the affected area is removed through a special needle inserted through the skin.\n\nResearchers say needle biopsy has fewer complications and a shorter recovery time than open surgical biopsy, but some women and doctors may have concerns about the accuracy of the procedure compared with traditional open surgery methods of breast cancer diagnosis.\n\nIn the study, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers reviewed 83 studies on the two methods.\n\nThe results showed that core needle biopsies were about as accurate as open surgery at detecting cancerous vs. noncancerous breast lesions.\n\nNeedle biopsies also had a much lower rate of complications (less than 1% compared with 2%-10% with open surgery).\n\nIn addition, the study showed women initially diagnosed with breast cancer with needle biopsy were more likely to be treated with a single breast cancer surgery than those initially diagnosed by open surgical biopsy.\n\n\"Based on currently available evidence, it appears reasonable to substitute core needle biopsy procedures for open surgical biopsy given the comparable sensitivity and lower complication rates,\" write researcher Wendy Bruening, PhD, of the ECRI Institute Evidence-Based Practices Center in Plymouth Meeting, Pa., and colleagues.

It does this by converting a key substance used by cancer cells to provide the energy they need for rapid division (pyruvate) into an unnatural lactate - leading to the cells' destruction.\n\nUniquely, this chemo-catalyst treatment can be recycled and reused within a cancer cell to attack it repeatedly.\n\nThis unprecedented functional ability to recycle and reuse the compound within cancer cells could lead to future anticancer drugs being administered in smaller, more effective, and potentially less toxic doses - decreasing the side-effects of chemotherapy.\n\nThe researchers have been focusing on the potential to use this compound on ovarian and prostate cancers.\n\nOvarian cancers are becoming increasingly resistant to existing chemotherapy drugs (such as the platinum drug, cisplatin). Since this new research functions in a totally new and unique way, it may overcome this acquired resistance and widen the spectrum of anticancer activity.\n\nImportantly, the development opens up a possibility for a more selective cancer treatment as JPC11 was observed to specifically target the biochemistry of cancer cells, leaving healthy cells largely untouched - another improvement compared to existing platinum-based drugs, which can also attack non-cancerous cells.\n\n\"This is a significant step in the fight against cancer.

Prediabetics are at increased risk for developing diabetes, which can damage the eyes, kidneys, nerves and blood vessels and often leads to cardiovascular disease.\n\nMany people with prediabetes also have untreated sleep apnea, although few of them are aware of it. The most widely accepted treatment for sleep apnea is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a device that blows a constant pressure of air into the lungs through a tube and face mask during the night. This helps people breathe better while they sleep by keeping the upper airway open.\n\n\"Our study showed that CPAP in patients with prediabetes can lower their risk of progressing to diabetes when CPAP is used for eight hours, a full night's sleep,\" said the study's lead author, Sushmita Pamidi, MD, a former fellow at the University of Chicago who is now on the faculty at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.\n\n\"Although eight hours of CPAP per night can be difficult to achieve in real-life, our results should provide a strong incentive for anyone with sleep apnea, especially prediabetic individuals, to improve adherence to their treatment for cardio-metabolic risk reduction,\" she said.\n\nPeople with sleep apnea, which is common among overweight and obese individuals, have repeated episodes where their upper airway closes during sleep. This can disrupt sleep and temporarily lower oxygen levels. It has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension and stroke, and may decrease their ability to regulate blood sugar levels. This increases the risk of diabetes.\n\nFor this study, the researchers recruited 39 middle-aged, overweight or obese volunteers with prediabetes and sleep apnea. Two-thirds of them (26) were randomly assigned to two weeks of CPAP treatment. The other 13 received a placebo -- a pill containing no medicine -- to be taken 30 minutes before bedtime. They were told the study would compare the two treatments.\n\nAll participants slept in the sleep laboratory and were closely monitored with all-night sleep recordings during the treatment period. Those assigned to CPAP wore the device for eight hours a night under continuous supervision by a technician. Before and after each treatment period, participants' glucose metabolism was assessed by oral and intravenous glucose-tolerance tests.\n\nThe researchers also measured the stress hormone noradrenaline in the blood and continuously monitored blood pressure for 24 hours at home. All participants were permitted to leave the laboratory during the day and engage in their routine activities.\n\nAfter two weeks, blood sugar control, as measured by an oral glucose tolerance test, improved for those in the CPAP group compared to the oral placebo group. In addition, the ability of insulin to regulate their blood sugar, estimated by the intravenous glucose tolerance test, was improved in the CPAP group compared to the oral placebo group. The CPAP group had, on average, 27 percent lower levels of the stress hormone, norepinephrine, as well as lower blood pressure than the oral placebo group.\n\n\"Despite the demonstrated efficacy of lifestyle interventions and the availability of many drug treatments, the economic and public health burden of diabetes remains enormous,\" said Esra Tasali, MD, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago and senior author of the study. \"Assessment of sleep apnea should be considered in patients at high risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, since our study shows that treatment of sleep apnea can reduce these risks.\"\n\nThe National Institutes of Health, plus the Diabetes Research and Training Center and the Institute for Translational Medicine at the University of Chicago funded this study.

The biomarkers also point to other underlying mechanisms that contribute to the progression of CF and could lead to better therapeutic interventions earlier in life.\n\n\"The easier it is to detect CF, the earlier it can be diagnosed, and the better people's chances are at living a longer, healthier life\", says Joanna Valsamis, Chief Healthcare, Research and Advocacy Officer at Cystic Fibrosis Canada. \"CF Canada invests heavily in research that aims to improve the lives of people living with CF, and findings such as those from Dr. Britz-McKibbin are crucial to our understanding of the disease.\"\n\nIn Canada, one in every 3,600 children are diagnosed with CF. But life expectancy rates have risen dramatically in recent decades with the median age of survival now over 50 years, due to better treatments to improve lung function, better nutrition and lung transplants. Further benefits are expected with the advent of newborn screening programs that have resulted in early detection.\n\nThe research was funded in part by Cystic Fibrosis Canada.

They came with \"horrible\" side effects, he said, and so he rarely took them.\n\nAs a blood pressure monitor squeezed snugly around his arm, the pharmacist counseled Thomas, 49, on his diet and stress level while checking his blood pressure. She then helped Thomas find a medication better suited for his body.\n\nThomas was not at a health clinic or pharmacy or a primary care physician's office.\n\nHe was at the barbershop where he works in Inglewood, California. As part of a study, these health services were provided at his barbershop and others across Los Angeles County.\n\nThe study, published Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine , tested whether pharmacist-led programs in barbershops could significantly lower high blood pressure in black men in the United States.\n\nResults from 12 months after the study show that when guidance was coupled with medication, a blood pressure measurement of less than 130/80 was achieved by 68% of men who participated in the study program, versus 11% of those who didn't.\n\n\"To a certain extent, I was surprised by the magnitude of the effect of the intervention,\" said Ciantel Blyler, a clinical pharmacist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles who was a co-author of the study.\n\n\"Especially once we sat down and looked at the blood pressure control rates and we were comparing the intervention group and the control group, I was sort of taken aback,\" she said.\n\n\"The first number, called systolic blood pressure, measures the pressure in your blood vessels when your heart beats,\" the CDC says. \"The second number, called diastolic blood pressure, measures the pressure in your blood vessels when your heart rests between beats.\"\n\nMany older black men tend to avoid seeing the doctor until they have a serious health problem, and then they \"use the emergency room as a doctor,\" Thomas said.\n\n\"If it wasn't for the program, a lot of guys wouldn't have known they had high blood pressure,\" he said of the study. \"Unfortunately, I wish we had other programs to come in, too.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the barbershop represents a safe haven in the black community -- a no-judgment zone -- where conversations about health and other personal topics are commonplace.\n\nAs a barber, \"we know more about our customers than their spouses do,\" Thomas said.\n\nShape your hair and your blood pressure\n\nThe new study included 319 black men across 52 black-owned barbershops in California's Los Angeles County. The men, 35 to 79 years old, had systolic blood pressure of 140 or more.\n\nThe researchers randomly assigned the men, based on their barbershop, to participate in the pharmacist-led program or to a control group between February 2015 and July 2017.\n\nIn the program group, barbers encouraged the men to meet with specially trained pharmacists at the barbershop to help monitor their blood pressure. The pharmacists could prescribe drug therapy under a collaborative agreement with the men's doctors.\n\nAt his barbershop, Thomas said, many customers were hesitant to open up to the pharmacists and doctors and to meet with them for health consultations.\n\n\"No one wanted to do it,\" he said. \"But by them being there -- they were in there every day -- and then we got used to them, and they warmed up to everybody. ...

Most Americans don't get the 25 to 38 grams a day that's recommended, depending on age and gender.\n\nBut if you're skimping on fiber, the health stakes are high, especially if you're a teenage girl.\n\nA study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics concludes that eating lots of fiber-rich foods during high school years may significantly reduce a woman's risk of developing breast cancer.\n\nThe findings are based on a long-term study of 44,000 women who were surveyed about their eating habits in high school. The women also completed detailed questionnaires about their dietary habits every four years.\n\nThe researchers found that women who consumed high levels of fiber (28 grams per day, on average) had a 24 percent lower risk of developing breast cancer before menopause, compared with women who ate low levels of fiber (14 grams per day, on average). For the women on the high-fiber diet, the lifetime risk of developing breast cancer was also cut by 16 percent.\n\nOf course, the idea that high-fiber diets can help keep us healthy is not new. It's well-known that fiber can prevent constipation and keep the bowel moving by making stools bulkier and absorbing water. Prior studies have shown dietary fiber can protect against colorectal cancer and may lower the risks of diabetes and heart disease. There's also a growing body of evidence linking fiber to weight management.\n\nThis new study provides some evidence of yet another potential benefit.\n\n\"This is a really important study ... [suggesting] that the more fiber you eat during your high school years, the lower your risk is in developing breast cancer,\" says Kimberly Blackwell, a breast cancer specialist at the Duke Cancer Center.\n\nIn a commentary accompanying the study in Pediatrics, Blackwell writes, \"There is longstanding evidence that dietary fibers may reduce circulating estrogen levels.\" And this may help explain the reduced risk of breast cancer.\n\nThe authors point to other possible explanations, too. For instance, high-fiber diets may reduce the risk of breast cancer by improving insulin sensitivity, since fiber can slow down the absorption of sugars and help keep blood sugar levels more stable.\n\nMaryam Farvid, a fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health who is lead author of the study, says the influence of fiber on cancer risk may be time-sensitive. Adolescence is \"a period when breast cancer risk factors appear to be particularly important,\" she says.\n\nOne limitation of this new study is that it relies on data from women who had to recall what they ate during high school. They were in their 30s and 40 when asked, so there could be \"recall bias\" \u2014 the women's memories may be foggy.\n\n\"The recollection of dietary habits more than a decade earlier must be questioned,\" writes Blackwell. On the other hand, she says, \"people's dietary habits don't really change a lot. ... In general, what you eat as a teenager is really formative as to what you eat later in life.\"\n\nSo, how might the message of this new study linking high-fiber diets to a lower risk of breast cancer be communicated to teenagers?\n\nThis is a question Kristi King, a dietitian at Texas Children's Hospital, has thought about a lot.\n\nShe says it can be hard to get the attention of teenagers about healthy eating. \"Unfortunately for teenagers, they're [into] instant gratification,\" and they're not necessarily focused on how their actions today will influence their future health, she says.\n\nBut, she says, explaining that dietary choices may influence their risk of breast cancer may grab their attention. \"Most teenage girls do know someone that has been affected by breast cancer,\" says King. \"So I feel like that touches a nerve with them.\"\n\nGiven the known benefits of high-fiber diets and the growing evidence that fiber may play a role in preventing disease, the government's Dietary Guidelines for Americans also say most people need to consume more.\n\nWomen are advised to consume 25 grams a day. Men are advised to consume 38 grams a day.\n\nSo, how best to reach these targets? \"Add fiber at each meal,\" says King, in the form of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts or seeds. Pears are a great bet with 7 grams of fiber apiece.\n\nAnd check out fiber-rich snacks, like popcorn and edamame.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "There are no new products or services at issue in this story, and we addressed access to healthy foods under \u201cCost,\u201d so we\u2019ll rate this not applicable.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "Vitamin D, in combination with calcium, is good for your bones.

But somehow we've arrived at a point when some physicians are prescribing large doses of Vitamin D supplements for their patients in the hope of preventing cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, autoimmune disorders and other maladies, despite a lack of evidence that this works, according to a new commentary in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

(For a chart with a little more detail, see here.) These amounts are enough for 97.5 percent of U.S. and Canadian residents, according to the IOM. (Sunlight stimulates production of vitamin D for people in sunnier climes.)\n\nGo above 4,000 IUs, unless there's a specific reason that you need that amount, and you risk kidney stones, calcification of blood vessels and possibly the very cardiovascular disease you were seeking to prevent, Manson said in an interview.\n\nSo how did we get here? \"I think there's been a disconnect between the observational studies and the randomized clinical trials to date,\" Manson said. Over the past 15 years, those studies \"have looked promising, and very often they've been reported by the media as suggesting that vitamin D has these benefits. I think there's a general perception that if some is good, more is better. I think it's important to understand that more is not necessarily better.\"\n\nManson is leading the most extensive clinical trial of vitamin D use ever, an examination of 25,875 people across the United States to determine whether vitamin D is helpful against cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, infection, autoimmune disorders and other conditions.

The recommended dietary allowance works out to three or four servings each day of \"fortified\" foods such as milk, yogurt, soy beverages, orange juice or cereal, plus fatty fish twice a week, according to Manson's commentary.\n\nShe also called on physicians not to overscreen patients for vitamin D deficiencies, a practice that can lead to overprescribing it.\n\n\"Large trials of other widely used supplements have sometimes found benefits,\" Manson wrote, \"but in other cases--such as with high doses of beta carotene, vitamin E and selenium--have disproven some health claims for these supplements and identified health risks that may not have otherwise been detected.\"", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story doesn\u2019t go into this, but it doesn\u2019t really need to.

In the study, women who skipped chemo based on the test had less than a 1 percent chance of cancer recurring far away, such as the liver or lungs, within the next five years.\n\n\u2018\u2018You can\u2019t do better than that,\u2019\u2019 said the study leader, Dr. Joseph Sparano of Montefiore Medical Center in New York.\n\nAn independent expert, Dr. Clifford Hudis of New York\u2019s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, agreed.\n\n\u2018\u2018There is really no chance that chemotherapy could make that number better,\u2019\u2019 he said. Using the gene test \u2018\u2018lets us focus our chemotherapy more on the higher risk patients who do benefit\u2019\u2019 and spare others the ordeal.\n\nThe study was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. Results were published online Monday by the New England Journal of Medicine and discussed at the European Cancer Congress in Vienna.\n\nThe study involved the most common type of breast cancer \u2014 early stage, without spread to lymph nodes; hormone-positive, meaning the tumor\u2019s growth is fueled by estrogen or progesterone; and not the type that the drug Herceptin targets. Each year, more than 100,000 women in the United States alone are diagnosed with this.\n\nThe usual treatment is surgery followed by years of a hormone-blocking drug. But many women also are urged to have chemo, to help kill any stray cancer cells that may have spread beyond the breast and could seed a new cancer later. Doctors know that most of these women don\u2019t need chemo but there are no great ways to tell who can safely skip it.\n\nA California company, Genomic Health Inc., has sold a test called Oncotype DX since 2004 to help gauge this risk. The test measures the activity of genes that control cell growth, and others that indicate a likely response to hormone therapy treatment.\n\nPast studies have looked at how women classified as low, intermediate or high risk by the test have fared. The new study is the first to assign women treatments based on their scores and track recurrence rates.\n\nOf the 10,253 women in the study, 16 percent were classified as low risk, 67 percent as intermediate and 17 percent as high risk for recurrence by the test. The high-risk group was given chemotherapy and hormone-blocking drugs. Women in the middle group were randomly assigned to get hormone therapy alone or to add chemo. Results on these groups are not yet ready \u2014 the study is continuing.\n\nBut independent monitors recommended the results on the low-risk group be released, because it was clear that adding chemo would not improve their fate.\n\nAfter five years, about 99 percent had not relapsed, and 98 percent were alive. About 94 percent were free of any invasive cancer, including new cancers at other sites or in the opposite breast.\n\n\u2018\u2018These patients who had low risk scores by Oncotype did extraordinarily well at five years,\u2019\u2019 said Dr. Hope Rugo, a breast cancer specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, with no role in the study. \u2018\u2018There is no chance that for these patients, that chemotherapy would have any benefit.\u2019\u2019\n\nDr. Karen Beckerman, a New York City obstetrician diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011, said she was advised to have chemo but feared complications. A doctor suggested the gene test and she scored very low for recurrence risk.\n\n\u2018\u2018I was convinced that there was no indication for chemotherapy. I was thrilled not to have to have it,\u2019\u2019 and has been fine since then, she said.\n\nMary Lou Smith, a breast cancer survivor and advocate who helped design the trial for ECOG, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, which ran it, said she thought women \u2018\u2018would be thrilled\u2019\u2019 to skip chemo.\n\n\u2018\u2018Patients love the idea of a test\u2019\u2019 to help reduce uncertainty about treatment, she said. \u2018\u2018I\u2019ve had chemotherapy.

Before researchers try a compound on humans, it\u2019s tested at labs in petri dishes and on animals, such as mice and monkeys. More often than not, these studies produce mixed data that don\u2019t tell researchers much about whether it is safe and effective for humans.\n\nFor some time, scientists have been searching for ways to cut down on the cost and failure rate of drug testing. Researchers at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University have developed a beautiful solution: Organs-On-Chips.\n\nThe clear and flexible polymer microchips are lined with human cells. Each one represents a different human organ system, such as lungs, heart and intestines. The institute\u2019s goal is to create 10 different organ systems that can be joined together by blood vessel channels to simulate human physiology on a microscale and provide a cheaper, more reliable way to test new drugs.\n\nThe sophisticated architecture of these organs-on-chips\u2014which are about the size of a thumb drive\u2014has also earned the Wyss Institute recognition in the art world with a Design of the Year award from the Design Museum and placement in the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s permanent collection.\n\n\u201cThe real power of this approach is that you have a window to the inner workings of life,\u201d says Don Ingber, founding director of the Wyss Institute and a professor of Vascular Biology and of Bioengineering at Harvard University. \u201cAnything you can ask at the molecular level, we could do in our chips.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, the team built and tested its first \u201corganoid\u201d chip to mimic the mechanical function of human lungs. It contains tiny channels separated by a porous membrane to create two distinct, hollow passageways\u2014one lined with human lung cells and the other with capillary blood vessel cells. Air is suctioned through the side channels to emulate breathing. Ingber and his team introduced bacteria into the chip\u2019s lung channel and white blood cells into the capillary channel. They observed that the white blood cells permeated the membrane and attacked the bacteria in the lung cell channel\u2014exactly what would happen in human lungs fighting off an infection.\n\nIn another experiment, the team at Wyss filled a chip\u2019s lung cell channel with interleukin 2, a chemotherapy drug known to cause pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs. When air entered the lung cell channel, the channel filled with fluid and then blood clots\u2014exactly what happens in the lungs of patients who develop this life-threatening condition. This proved the chips could provide real world information to scientists studying the effects of new drug compounds.\n\nThe project has received support from the National Institutes of Health and the FDA. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency also recently awarded the institute a $37 million grant to create chips representing nearly all systems in the body. Ingber says some scientists are interested in using the chips to conduct research that would be unethical if performed on people, such as studying the effects of gamma radiation on the human body.\n\nOf course, the chips have limitations. \u201cWe can\u2019t mimic consciousness; we can\u2019t mimic compression on a joint,\u201d says Ingber.\n\nDanilo Tagle, associate director for special initiatives at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, a division of the NIH, is spearheading a similar organ-on-chip project. He suspects that in the beginning the chips will be used to \u201ccomplement and supplement\u201d animal studies, but will eventually become routine practice. The chips will also provide researchers with information on dosing at a much earlier stage in drug studies\u2014particularly helpful because animals metabolize chemical substances at a different rate than humans. \u201cYou can go forward with a candidate drug with greater assurance and confidence that it will have the desired effect on humans,\u201d says Tagle. \u201cBiology is very complex.\u201d\n\nIncorporating the chips into drug testing could save millions of dollars and years of time on research. Some companies are already trying out the concept. Janssen Pharmaceuticals Company, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, is using a version of the chips to understand how blood clots in the lungs. The information is essential to reduce the risk for this side effect of oncology drugs.\n\nThough there still aren\u2019t enough data to prove the chips are reliable enough to put rodents out of a job, Ingber says it\u2019s only a matter of time; they hope to have them tested and ready for market in two years. \u201cThe FDA has been very supportive,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve told us if they are as good as animals that they would consider accepting data provided by a drug company from one of these models rather than an animal model.\u201d", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "It is clear from the story that this technology is still under development, with a recent grant from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to create chips for all systems in the body.

Of the 12 AML patients who received this experimental T-cell therapy after a transplant put their disease in remission, all are still in remission after a median follow-up of more than two years.\n\nGiving these cells when disease is in remission after transplant \"might actually be helping patients who have a high risk of relapsing to not relapse down the line,\" said Dr. Aude Chapuis, cancer physician and immunotherapy researcher at Fred Hutch, one of the study's leaders. Chapuis presented these results at the 2016 annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology in San Diego, California.\n\nThe findings in this group of trial participants contrast with the outcomes the researchers observed in a cohort of similar patients who received transplants around the same time but did not receive engineered T cells. In all of these transplant-only patients, the transplants produced remissions, but more than a quarter of them relapsed within just 10 months.\n\nIn the experimental T-cell therapy tested in this trial, certain T cells from each patient's transplant donor were genetically engineered to produce receptors that allowed the T cells to recognize, very specifically, a target molecule called WT1. WT1 is 10 to 1,000 times more common in leukemia cells than their noncancerous cousins, making it a natural target for therapies designed to destroy cancer cells while leaving most healthy cells alone.\n\nThis is the team's first trial of this strategy, which was initially developed in the lab of Dr. Phil Greenberg, one of the study's leaders and the head of Fred Hutch's Program in Immunology. Because it was the first study of this particular approach, the researchers focused on a high-risk group -- AML patients undergoing bone marrow transplant who had certain genetic or disease characteristics that decrease the chance of long-term transplant success -- \"a hard population of patients,\" Chapuis said, many of whom \"were horribly sick.\"\n\nEach patient's therapy was created just for them in a specialized Fred Hutch facility. Certain T cells from each patient's matched donor were given the genetic instructions to make a receptor that specifically reacts to WT1. Then came a blood stem cell transplant: Patients' leukemic bone marrow and blood cells were destroyed and replaced with healthy cells from their donors. A month later, when the team examined these 12 patients' marrow, they found no trace of the cancers. Rapidly thereafter, once the transplanted cells fully engrafted, each patient then received up to 10 billion of the genetically engineered donor cells, infused into their arm through an IV.\n\nChapuis's role in this trial is on the laboratory side of the research, ensuring the quality of the genetically engineered cell products and monitoring the activity of the cells after infusion. She co-leads this research with Greenberg and Dr. Dan Egan of Fred Hutch, the trial's principal investigator and the care provider for trial participants. The study was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health and spinoff Juno Therapeutics, of which Greenberg is a scientific co-founder.\n\nOutside of this trial, Chapuis treats cancer patients at Fred Hutch's clinical care partner, Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. Watching her patients undergo bone marrow transplant ? itself the first clear and reproducible example of cancer immunotherapy, developed at Fred Hutch ? has made her want to work toward something better.\n\n\"That's my source of inspiration. I'm always horrified by the intense treatment that we inflict on bone marrow transplant patients and the hardship that we make them go through. And I really think we can do better,\" Chapuis said. \"That's why I'm doing this.\"\n\nAt Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, home to three Nobel laureates, interdisciplinary teams of world-renowned scientists seek new and innovative ways to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, HIV/AIDS and other life-threatening diseases. Fred Hutch's pioneering work in bone marrow transplantation led to the development of immunotherapy, which harnesses the power of the immune system to treat cancer with minimal side effects.

On fertile days, users must abstain from sex or use other protection such as condoms to prevent pregnancy. The app was approved as a class IIb medical device by T\u00fcv S\u00fcd, a notified body in Sweden where it is based.\n\nBut sexual health organisations are warning that being classed as a medical device does not guarantee that the app will effectively prevent pregnancy. Sexual health charity the FPA, Fertility UK, and the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists are jointly calling for more large-scale independent trials to ensure that evidence for such apps is on a par with other rigorously tested methods of contraception.\n\nNatural Cycles is one of numerous apps that help women practise a method of contraception called natural family planning, also known as the fertility awareness method.\n\n\n\nNatural family planning involves monitoring your body for signs of ovulation, like an increase in your temperature, or a change in cervical mucus.\n\n\"The thing about the female egg is that it only lives for about 24 hours. So if you could reliably know when you've ovulated as a woman, and then you give that egg two or three days to die, any time after that in the cycle you will not get pregnant because there's no egg to fertilise,\" Dr Susan Walker, a senior lecturer in sexual health at Anglia Ruskin University, told BuzzFeed News.\n\n\n\nTaking your temperature is what sets Natural Cycles and other apps like it apart from standard period-tracking apps. Without temperature information an app can can guess at your ovulation day based on your average cycle length, but can't be sure when you actually have ovulated, and so you can't use it as a reliable form of birth control.\n\nYou don't actually need an app to practise natural family planning \u2013 although it does cut down on paperwork. Even so, the FPA advises that natural family planning is most effective if you\u2019re taught how to do it by a specialist teacher, and you monitor all three fertility indicators \u2013 temperature, menstrual cycle length, and cervical secretions.\n\nBut natural family planning is not for everyone. For starters, it can only protect against pregnancy, not STIs.\n\nAnd if you're considering ditching the Pill because remembering to take it each day is too much effort, you probably won't like having to remember to take your temperature every morning.\n\n\"You really have to commit to it, whether you're doing it the traditional way or you're using an app. You have to take your temperature every morning and record that, because without all that data it's not really any use to you,\" Bekki Burbidge, head of communications at the FPA, told BuzzFeed News. \"It's not a method that's going to suit everybody.\"\n\nBut for women like Natural Cycles co-founder Dr Elina Berglund, who want an alternative to hormonal contraception, it's an option worth pursuing. Along with her husband and co-founder Dr Raoul Scherwitzl, Berglund created the algorithm used in the app for personal use, before deciding it was something she should share with the rest of the world.\n\n\"When it comes to contraception it's all about choice. It's not like one solution will fit all women,\" said Berglund.\n\n\"Our typical user is in a stable relationship a few years before wanting to have kids. At first she starts to use the app to prevent pregnancy, and when she's ready [to get pregnant] she switches to plan, and usually she gets pregnant quite quickly, because the app already knows her body and cycle.\"\n\n\n\nTo use the app, you need a monthly or yearly subscription, and a thermometer that you have to use to take your temperature each morning before you get out of bed.\n\n\n\nThe app then tells you if you're likely to be fertile or not that day. And if the app gives you a \"red day\" \u2013 meaning you could be fertile \u2013 you have to abstain from sex, or use another method of protection such as condoms.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story names the company that produces the app and links to the company\u2019s website.

Surgeons replace the raw bone ends with smooth, artificial surfaces that restore at least some of the joint's normal function. They anchor these prosthetics to the remaining bone with screws and cement.\n\nWrist replacement is much more complicated than hip and knee replacement. More than a dozen bones lie beneath the skin and muscles of the hand and wrist, compared with two or three for those larger joints. The wrist procedure replaces some of the small carpal bones altogether and sends as many as three screws into the hand.\n\n\"Our hand is our working instrument,\" said Dr. Evan D. Collins, an orthopedic surgeon with the Methodist Center for Sports Medicine. \"It twists on all planes, it goes up, down, sideways and it rotates.\"\n\nSome form of wrist replacement surgery has been available but seldom used for decades. More commonly, surgeons perform fusion procedures that relieve pain but immobilize the wrist. Replacement, by contrast, preserves some range of motion.\n\n\"The cost is that you don't have the ability to lift heavy objects,\" Collins said. \"What you trade against that is range of motion.\"\n\nAfter replacement surgery and months of physical therapy, patients can lift no more than 15 or 20 pounds, he said.\n\nOlder prosthetics used in wrist replacement required removing significant amounts of bone, which made later fusion problematic if the surgery failed, Collins explained.\n\n\"Some of the newer implant designs save a lot of the bone stock,\" said Collins, who performs about 10 wrist replacements a year. \"If it does fail, revising it may not as difficult as it has been in the past.\"\n\nFusion may remain more appropriate for some people with very active lifestyles or jobs that require lifting heavy objects or using bone-jarring tools.\n\nUnder low-wear conditions, doctors expect joint prosthetics to last 10 to 15 years, another reason replacement might not be considered for younger people.\n\nPotential patients must be evaluated for other causes of pain, Collins noted, because problems with thumbs or other hand parts can make the wrist hurt. Occasionally, other conditions must be addressed in addition to joint damage. Collins performed a carpal tunnel procedure while replacing Chambers' wrist joint, but he said such combination surgery isn't common.\n\nChambers spent two nights in the hospital after her operation in April.\n\nShe wore a cast for two months, a splint for another two and continued physical therapy through July.\n\nShe still can't lift more than 11 pounds, but the pain has greatly subsided.\n\n\"It's just about gone.

Treatment usually involves surgical removal of the uterus, known as hysterectomy. At the same time, lymph nodes are often removed to determine the stage of the cancer and whether further treatment is necessary.\n\nThe research team from the Florida Hospital Cancer Institute, in Orlando, reviewed eight prior studies, including nearly 1,600 patients who underwent either an open, closed or robot-assisted hysterectomy and lymph node removal.\n\nIn the open surgery, a relatively large incision is made in the abdominal wall. The closed procedure, known as laparoscopy, requires a much smaller cut, through which small instruments and a video camera are inserted. However, this minimally invasive approach also calls for significant training on the part of the surgeon to overcome challenges such as the counterintuitive movements involved in working from images on a TV monitor.\n\nRobotic-assisted surgery is similar to laparoscopy, only the instruments and cameras are integrated into robotic arms, which the surgeon operates through a control console. The robotic equipment provides better three-dimensional vision, increased range of motion and intuitive, downscaled movements, while adding a few thousand more dollars to the procedure\u2019s price tag, the authors note.\n\n\u201cAlso with the computer-enhanced robotic technology, no matter how much coffee you drink in the morning, your movements don\u2019t have tremors,\u201d said Nezhat.\n\nBased on their review, the researchers found that minimally invasive surgeries done with a human hand and instruments or with robotic assistance equipment took around the same time and resulted in similarly long stays in the hospital. However, about half as much blood was lost when robots were enlisted than with standard laparoscopy.\n\nBoth minimally invasive techniques resulted in longer-duration operations than open surgery. But both also led to shorter hospital stays and, in the case of robotic surgery, less blood-loss.\n\nFurther, the average number of lymph nodes removed was about the same in the robotic and open procedures, suggesting that both approaches result in about equal surgeon accuracy in staging endometrial cancer.\n\nNo differences between the three methods were seen in the numbers of complications, report the researchers in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology.\n\n\u201cThe robot will not really decrease human errors but it will make the surgery easier,\u201d Dr. Tommaso Falcone of the Cleveland Clinic, in Ohio, who was also not involved in the study, told Reuters Health in an e-mail.\n\n\u201cRobotics increases the chance that a hysterectomy can be done by laparoscopy,\u201d he added. \u201cHowever, if the surgeon is skilled enough to do the hysterectomy without the robot by laparoscopy then the outcomes will be similar.\u201d\n\nNezhat further noted that while robotic assistance can be a good \u201cenabler\u201d for a minimally invasive approach, surgeons should have at least the basic knowledge of regular laparoscopy too, as there may be times when the robotic equipment doesn\u2019t work.\n\nThe reviewers point out that some of the differences found, such as the longer operation times for robotic-assisted surgery, may be due to surgeons\u2019 inexperience with the new tool and could improve over time.\n\nOn the other hand, the newness of the technology could have deterred surgeons from using it for difficult cases, potentially biasing the results in a positive way for the robotic technique.\n\nRobotic surgery equipment only received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in 2005. More research is needed to be able to compare long-term outcomes, wrote the researchers.\n\nNezhat advises women to look for a surgeon experienced in doing minimally invasive surgery. If a robot is to be enlisted, he recommends asking how the procedure would be performed if the robot is not available or if it doesn\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cRobotic-assisted surgery is in its infancy, and it definitely has a future,\u201d said Nezhat. \u201cIts benefits should offset its higher costs.\u201d", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story didn\u2019t include \u2013 and it wouldn\u2019t have taken much to do so \u2013 any estimate of the number of robotic surgery facilities in the US.\u00a0 And it didn\u2019t give any estimate of how often the open, laparoscopic or robotic procedures are done.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Tammy Wade knew she had to try something else to lose weight when she stepped on the scale and saw the number: 203 pounds.\n\nWade, 50, of McCalla, Ala., is only 5 feet 3 inches tall. She had tried everything. Nothing worked.\n\n\"I had problems with my feet and ankles, and they were saying I was borderline diabetic,\" Wade says. \"I'm like, well, I gotta do something, you know. So, I needed, really did need to lose the weight.\"\n\nSo Wade volunteered to help test Qnexa, an experimental drug pending before the Food and Drug Administration. She quickly noticed a big difference.\n\n\"I didn't feel ravenous, and I didn't want to snack all day long,\" she says.\n\nOver the next year, Qnexa helped Wade slowly drop about 40 pounds, and keep it off for another year. \"It makes you feel so much better,\" Wade says. \"Your back don't hurt, your feet don't hurt.\"\n\nBut the FDA rejected Qnexa in 2010 because of concerns about side effects, especially possible heart problems and birth defects.\n\nQnexa's rejection came amid a flurry of failed attempts by drug companies to win approvals of new weight-loss drugs. The setbacks put a spotlight on how the FDA handles these drugs.\n\nEven though obesity is at epidemic levels, the FDA hasn't approved any new weight-loss medicines since 1999.\n\n\"We have two-thirds of all Americans who are overweight or obese, and the costs are nearing $150 billion a year,\" says Christine Ferguson, a health policy professor at George Washington University. \"The sheer magnitude of the problem really requires us to address it more aggressively and thoughtfully than we have.\"\n\nFerguson has been helping to organize a series of meetings involving public health experts, anti-obesity advocates, government officials and others to try to figure out what the FDA should do.\n\n\"We actually have this huge gap,\" says Joe Nadglowski of the Obesity Action Coalition, who has been participating in the meetings. \"We go from Weight Watchers to bariatric surgery. And the fact that there isn't ... medical treatments for obesity, including pharmaceuticals, really is a challenge, considering how big the problem is in this country.\"\n\nPart of what's going on is that the FDA has gotten a lot more cautious about approving new drugs in general after some serious drug-safety problems, such as heart problems linked to the painkiller Vioxx.\n\nThe FDA has been especially tough on weight-loss drugs because of previous problems with those drugs, such as the diet drug cocktail fen-phen.\n\n\"There's been a long history with obesity drugs that we've had to take off the market. You recall the fen-phen episode where a significant number of people got heart-valve defects,\" says Janet Woodcock, a top FDA official.\n\nWoodcock argues that the agency has to be extra-careful with weight-loss drugs, because chances are it won't just be obese people taking them.\n\n\"When you're talking about a drug where it could go into literally tens of millions of Americans, there has to be attention to safety,\" Woodcock says.\n\nWhat might look like a rare problem now could turn into another public health disaster, she says.\n\nBut some say the agency's aversion to accepting any risks is outdated. They say the FDA wrongly still tends to view weight-loss drugs as diet pills \u2014 something frivolous and used primarily for cosmetic purposes.\n\n\"We are not talking about medications to help someone lose five pounds to fit into their prom dress or wedding dress. We're talking about medications to help those who are struggling with the health impact of obesity,\" Nadglowski says.\n\nSo Nadglowski and others are pushing the FDA to take into consideration whether the risks of new drugs may be outweighed by their benefits beyond weight loss, such as reducing the risk for heart disease, diabetes and other complications of obesity.\n\nWoodcock says officials realize they may have to think about things differently.\n\nAs the FDA works through this, many are watching how the agency handles Qnexa. An FDA advisory panel is scheduled to review Qnexa again on Feb. 22.\n\nBarbara Troupin of Vivus, the company that is developing Qnexa, says the drug appears to do a lot more than just help people lose weight.\n\n\"We see decreases in blood pressure. We see decreased rates of progression to diabetes. We see improvements in sleep apnea. We see improvements in quality of life. Pretty much all of our data shows significant benefits,\" she says.\n\nVivus hopes the FDA will agree that those benefits will outweigh some of the risks, including the concerns about birth defects. The company is submitting new data it says show that the risk is lower than had been feared. Vivus also has a plan to minimize the chances that pregnant women will take it.\n\nSome see Qnexa as a test of the FDA trying to recalibrate how it weighs risks and benefits for weight-loss drugs.\n\nFor her part, Wade just wants to be able to start taking it again.

It comes from the fiber-optic tip of Metson's endoscope, which also holds a high-res camera lens.\n\nOn the monitor, you can see the miniature instruments he's using to cut away inflamed tissue and snip away pieces of eggshell-thin bone that block Butler's sinuses and give her nonstop headaches. To avoid poking through to the brain or into the orbit of an eye, there's a device around the patient's head with a guidance system that tells Metson, in three dimensions, exactly where his sharp instruments are on a CT scan of Butler's head.\n\nAfter an hour or so of this delicate work, Metson has opened up the 72-year-old woman's sinuses so they can drain. \"The next time she gets a cold,\" he says, \"her membranes are not going to swell and block the sinuses the way they have in the past. They're going to stay open.\"\n\nThis is modern sinus surgery. It's a lot less brutal than the old days -- back in the early 1980s. Then, surgeons cut through the face and mouth, scraped out the sinuses and left patients bruised and scarred. Often they were no better off, sometimes worse.\n\nAdvances since then have persuaded more doctors to do sinus surgery. So a lot more people are getting it -- around 300,000 a year, making it one of the most common operations.\n\nBut how good is it, in terms of giving patients relief from the pain, breathing difficulty and fatigue of chronic sinusitis?\n\n\"Surgery is usually not curative,\" Metson says. \"But probably in over 90 percent of the cases, it does significantly improve a patient's quality of life. He or she will still have infections after surgery. But hopefully they'll be less frequent, less severe and shorter in duration. A brief course of antibiotics will work better after surgery.\"\n\nJudy Foreman, another of Metson's patients, offers an example of both how surgery can help -- and why patients' expectations shouldn't be too high.\n\nForeman had sinus surgery two years ago, when she was 64, after trying everything else. (See sidebar.) She rinsed out her sinuses faithfully with saltwater. She tried decongestants, antihistamines and steroid nasal sprays. Over and over, Metson prescribed antibiotics.\n\nFor about 80 percent of patients, these nonsurgical alternatives manage the problem adequately, Metson says. But Foreman was in the other 20 percent.\n\nForeman writes a health column for The Boston Globe and other newspapers, so she's an unusually well-informed patient. \"I read an article about people feeling less tired all the time after having had surgery, and I thought, boy, I would really like that,\" she says.\n\nWhen she asked Metson about surgery, he said most people with her degree of sinus problems would have had it long before.\n\n\"I thought, 'OK, so I'm just being scared,' \" Foreman says. She didn't like to think of someone sticking sharp instruments up her nose and cutting away delicate tissue. But when she overcame her squeamishness and finally had the operation, she found it wasn't nearly as bad as she thought it would be.\n\n\"It's uncomfortable,\" she reports. \"Afterwards you have these cotton wads up your nose and, of course, you can't breathe with all this stuff in your nose.\" But she didn't hurt very much. \"I was so glad to get it over with that I would say the pain was not bad at all.\"\n\nAnd the outcome? Now she has three or four sinus infections a year instead of five or more. They're not as bad as before. Still, she's disappointed.\n\n\"I'm not like a person without this problem,\" she says. \"I get a cold and I freak out because I know it's going to be there for three weeks. Other people get it and they're done in five days.\"\n\nForeman wrote a column about her surgery. Two years later, she's still getting e-mail from people asking whether they should have it.\n\n\"I say, 'Go for it!' Because I think it's made enough of a difference that I'm glad I did it,\" Foreman says. She'd consider a second operation, but Metson says usually that's advised only for patients with nasal polyps that regrow -- not a problem she has.\n\nMetson says most of his patients do better than Foreman. But surgery rarely cures them. That's because surgery doesn't touch the root cause of chronic sinusitis.\n\nSurgeons can cut away bone and membranes that block sinuses. But they can't stop the inflammation some people are prone to, and that inflammation can cause new obstructions.\n\nTo tackle that problem, researchers have discovered five genes involved in that inflammatory process. Metson hopes drugs will be developed to regulate those genes.\n\n\"And if we can use those as novel targets for, let's say, nasal sprays or medications, we may be able to treat people like Judy without surgery,\" Metson says. \"Or we'll do surgery and follow it up after surgery with these sprays.\"\n\nThat, he says, will be the next big advance in sinus treatment.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story states that about\u00a0300,000 people a year\u00a0undergo sinus surgery, making it one of the most commonly performed\u00a0procedures in the U.S.\u00a0 However, it does not provide statistics on the number or percentage of those procedures that are performed endoscopically and the type of hospital setting in which they are done.

The researchers estimated that shifting standard practice by 30 percent to the wrist approach, along with same-day discharge, could save the United States $300 million per year.\n\n\u201cWe have unequivocal evidence and data that show better outcomes when we access the heart\u2019s coronary arteries and perform angioplasty through a blood vessel in the wrist rather than through the femoral artery in the groin,\u201d said first author Amit P. Amin, MD, an assistant professor of medicine. \u201cThe femoral artery is the traditional route, but when we go in through a vessel in the wrist, we see less bleeding, fewer complications, less pain and discomfort, higher patient satisfaction, shorter hospital stays, and lower costs.\u201d\n\nPatients may undergo coronary angioplasty \u2014 also called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) \u2014 to alleviate chest pain or shortness of breath. Such symptoms suggest the coronary arteries that deliver blood to the heart are blocked or narrowed and oxygen delivery to the heart muscle is reduced. Interventional cardiologists insert a small tube into an artery in the wrist or the groin, which can be used to view the narrowed heart artery, deliver an inflatable balloon to open up the narrowed section, and possibly deliver a stent to hold the vessel open.\n\nUsing the National Cardiovascular Data Registry CathPCI Registry, the researchers analyzed data from almost 280,000 Medicare patients who underwent PCI and were eligible for same-day discharge. Despite the fact that all of these patients were capable of leaving the hospital the same day as their procedures, only about 5 percent of these patients actually were discharged without having stayed overnight.\n\n\u201cWe have seen that it is very safe to send these patients home the same day,\u201d said Amin, who treats patients at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. \u201cWe use risk-prediction models to predict their risks ahead of time, and we plan ahead to mitigate any issues so we can facilitate a same-day discharge. This is really about patient care. We want to outline health-care pathways that provide the best care for patients.\u201d\n\nThe analysis demonstrated an average cost of $13,389 for the wrist approach with same-day discharge, compared with $17,076 for the groin approach with at least one night of hospitalization, resulting in a cost savings of about $3,700 for outpatients who get the wrist-access procedure. Independent of the length of stay, the wrist approach costs about $900 less than the groin approach, on average.\n\nThe investigators estimated that if a hospital performing 1,000 of these procedures annually shifted 30 percent of these patients to the wrist-access with same-day discharge approach, the hospital would save $1 million over that period. Expanding that practice to hospitals nationwide might save the United States $300 million in health-care spending per year. Health-care costs for the 600,000 patients who receive PCI each year in the U.S. are estimated to be $10 billion.\n\nOf the study\u2019s patient population receiving PCI, 9 percent received the procedure in which doctors used wrist access. According to Amin, improved technology has allowed wrist access to become a viable route to the coronary arteries, even for complex cases, and should be considered for more patients.\n\n\u201cThe traditional way has been to go through the bigger femoral artery that is a straight pathway to the heart,\u201d Amin said. \u201cUnfortunately, that artery is also deep. It\u2019s associated with more bleeding complications. In contrast, the wrist artery is small and is associated with fewer complications. The minor challenge is in the difficulty of navigating a smaller, more twisting path of an artery through the wrist.

For women age 55 to 79, aspirin is recommended to prevent strokes, with the same caveat.\n\nThe new work, by Alfred Bartolucci of the University of Alabama at Birmingham and colleagues, was supported by aspirin-maker Bayer AG.\n\nThe research team pooled the results of the nine trials that have tested the drug in the prevention of heart disease so far, including three that weren\u2019t part of the 2009 USPSTF review.\n\nAbout 100,000 men and women age 45 and up took part in the studies. Some were healthy and some had diabetes, but none had chest pain or other symptoms of an ailing heart.\n\nThe researchers found a 19-percent reduction in non-fatal heart attacks among participants who took aspirin compared to those who did not.\n\nThey don\u2019t mention how many people actually suffered such a heart attack, but an earlier analysis of six of the trials showed that out of every 1,000 people, 18 individuals taking aspirin had heart attacks every year, compared to 23 individuals taking placebo pills.\n\nOn the other hand, that analysis also found aspirin increased the rate of bleeding from 0.7 to 1 per 1,000 people per year, making the authors conclude the drug was of \u201cuncertain net value.\u201d\n\nHeart disease is the leading killer worldwide and accounts for more than a third of deaths in the U.S., according to the American Heart Association. Every year, heart attacks alone kill some 400,000 Americans.\n\nIn the current study, published in the American Journal of Cardiology, the researchers also report small decreases in stroke and death risks with aspirin, although those changes might have been due to chance.\n\n\u201cIt refines our knowledge of how beneficial aspirin is,\u201d Dr. Graham Nichol, an expert in emergency care at the University of Washington in Seattle, said about the study. \u201cI don\u2019t think this paper is inconsistent with previous work.\u201d\n\nNichols, who was not involved in the study, said aspirin is clearly beneficial for people who\u2019ve already had heart disease, and that it also seems to help those at high risk.\n\n\u201cThere is not universal agreement on what is high risk,\u201d he told Reuters Health. \u201cIn my mind, if you have diabetes or multiple risk factors for heart disease \u2014 such as smoking or obesity \u2014 it is reasonable to take aspirin.\u201d\n\nIn addition, working to eliminate those risk factors by other means will not only slash the risk of heart disease, but also a host of other health problems.\n\nLeFevre added that while the new study did add extra evidence compared with earlier work, it failed to analyze the effects on men and women separately.\n\nThat muddies the picture because men may see a benefit in the form of fewer heart attacks, whereas aspirin appears to lower the risk of stroke in women.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t tell from the existing study if that is going to hold up or not,\u201d he said.\n\nOne recent study has suggested that despite the increase in bleeding ulcers from aspirin, the reduction in heart attacks might make the cheap drug cost-effective for men over 45.\n\nThe question then becomes finding out what your risk of heart attack is in the first place, which your doctor can help with.\n\n\u201cThe number of events that you prevent depends on your baseline risk,\u201d LeFevre concluded. \u201cA blanket recommendation that everybody should take an aspirin is not a good idea.\u201d", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Not applicable.\u00a0 The availability of aspirin is not in question.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "Baltimore, Md. (Embargoed until 12:30 p.m., June 8, 2015) - A novel radionuclide drug tackles the challenge of prostate cancer imaging and takes a turn as a cancer-killing therapy for tumors in and out of the prostate, according to research presented during the 2015 Annual Meeting of the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI).\n\nThe drug works by delivering diagnostic- or therapy-grade radionuclides to cells that express a protein called prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), found on the surface of prostate cancer cells and their metastatic counterparts throughout the body. Clinicians can diagnose or stage disease and monitor therapy with the aid of a special hybrid scanner used to perform minimally invasive positron emission tomography (PET).\n\n\"Prostate cancer still represents one of the main causes for cancer-related deaths among men,\" said Matthias Eder, PhD, co-author of the study and a researcher in the division of radiopharmaceutical chemistry at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg, Germany. \"The diagnosis and therapy of metastatic prostate cancer is still challenging. The current clinical methods are not sensitive enough for detecting disease beyond the prostate, but we are convinced that this novel theranostic radiotracer represents a significant step forward that could have a major impact on the future of prostate cancer care.\"\n\nThe PSMA-inhibiting theranostic agent, called PSMA-617, is still in its initial stages, but it could be ideal for the treatment of patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancers, which are notoriously difficult to control and linked to poor prognosis. Options for these patients are few, and they come with substantial adverse effects. Diagnosis and therapy with the theranostic agent PSMA-617 could offer more effective and sensitive visualization, better staging and significantly higher therapeutic potential. To be clear, other PSMA-based theranostics have reached the research bench, but previous contenders had too many limitations in terms of instability in live subjects, a lack of imaging contrast between targeted tissue and background signal and increased PSMA-associated binding to normal organs such as the kidneys. This new radionuclide drug shows strong binding to the protein PSMA and is readily and safely taken up by malignant PSMA-positive tumors. PSMA-617 could represent a watershed moment for prostate cancer theranostics.\n\nFor this research, scientists first imaged mice with an imaging-grade radionuclide, gallium-68, to assess the diagnostic value of PSMA-617. Diagnostic imaging was followed by a therapy-grade radionuclide, lutetium-177, which delivers a more powerful dose of radiation that penetrates and destroys the cells and tissues of tumors when combined with PSMA-617. This phase was followed by a first-in-human clinical trial of both imaging and therapy in a single person.\n\nResults of the human study showed that imaging was effective for the evaluation of metastatic prostate cancer, and subsequent therapy resulted in a drop in prostate-specific antigen levels from 38.0 to 4.6 nanograms per milliliter. Positive response to therapy was verified via combined PET and computed tomography (PET/CT), a hybrid imaging system that shows both functional and structural aspects of the body.\n\nApproximately one out of seven men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime, according to 2015 statistics from the American Cancer Society. About 220,800 new prostate cancer diagnoses and 27,540 prostate-cancer-related deaths are expected to occur in the U.S. this year.\n\nScientific Paper 63: \"PSMA-617 - a novel theranostic PSMA inhibitor for both diagnosis and endoradiotherapy of prostate cancer,\" M.

High levels of PSA can be a marker for prostate cancer, although it's far from a perfect screening tool, experts say. Men with both high and low levels of PSA can have cancer or not have cancer.\n\nThe thought was that since high PSA levels are correlated with prostate cancer, rapidly rising levels of PSA, called \"PSA velocity,\" from one year to another would also be an indicator of prostate cancer.\n\nHowever, the new study found that PSA velocity doesn't add any useful information beyond what physicians can already tell from other methods of prostate cancer screening, including the one-time PSA level test and digital rectal exams.\n\nCurrent screening guidelines that recommend biopsies for men who have high PSA velocity but no other signs of prostate cancer -- such as a suspected abnormality during a digital rectal exam or high PSA level during a single test -- are leading to many unnecessary biopsies, the researchers said.\n\n\"We found there was no strong association between PSA velocity and prostate cancer, and virtually none with aggressive prostate cancer,\" said study author Andrew Vickers, of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. \"The velocity didn't add anything more to detecting aggressive prostate cancers.\"\n\nThe study is published online Feb. 24 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nThe whole issue of prostate cancer screening -- including the PSA test, the digital rectal exam and PSA velocity -- has been controversial, said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society (ACS).\n\nPart of the difficulty is, while current screening methods are good at detecting cancer, they can't distinguish between aggressive, life-threatening prostate cancers and those that are slow-growing and relatively benign. And many prostate cancers are just that -- of little risk to men during their lifetimes, Brawley said.\n\nCurrent ACS prostate screening cancer guidelines recommend that men make an informed decision with their doctor about whether to be tested for prostate cancer. \"Research has not yet proven that the potential benefits of testing outweigh the harms of testing and treatment,\" according to the ACS.\n\nAs for PSA velocity, the ACS doesn't have a position on what PSA velocity warrants a biopsy.\n\nBut the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Urological Association guidelines do recommend biopsies based on high PSA velocities, even in the absence of an elevated PSA or a suspicious digital rectal exam, according to background information in the study.\n\nAnd many internal medicine and primary-care doctors, in part because of fears of litigation, do order biopsies based on fast-rising PSA levels, Brawley said.\n\n\"It's something that has become almost a community standard. If a guy has a PSA of .8 last year, and a year or so later you've repeated it and it's 1.9, because it has increased by a factor of 1 he gets sent to biopsy,\" Brawley said.\n\nIn the study, researchers used data on more than 5,500 men in their 60s and 70s who took part in a drug trial for a prostate cancer prevention drug. The men in the study were all from the placebo arm, meaning they had not received the drug. As part of the trial, all of the men agreed to have a biopsy at the end of the trial, needed or not.\n\nResearchers did find a statistical association between PSA velocity and the chances of a biopsy coming back cancerous. But when they factored in other things that can influence risk, including a family history of the disease, being older, being black, PSA level and results of a digital rectal exam, there was virtually no association between PSA velocity and biopsy outcome.\n\n\"PSA velocity measurement is not useful,\" Brawley said.\n\nGrace Lu-Yao, a cancer epidemiologist at the Cancer Institute of New Jersey who wrote an accompanying editorial, said she agreed with the authors' conclusions that PSA velocity does not seem to be a good predictor of prostate cancer.\n\nIn addition, tracking PSA levels overtime can also cause anxiety to men, who often worry if their PSA level has suddenly shot up.\n\n\"According to the data, PSA velocity does not add any value, but it may add more anxiety,\" Lu-Yao said.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute has more on the PSA test.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "It\u2019s clear from the story that PSA tests are readily available.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "DANVILLE, Calif., April 11, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Palo Alto Health Sciences, Inc.

Two studies reported nearly 80% of Freespira-treated patients were panic attack free at 12 months post-treatment. Two additional studies reported that patients with mixed anxiety disorders and low exhaled CO2 at baseline were less responsive and/or discontinued treatment with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or Acceptance Commitment Therapy.\n\nEarly data from a fifth study reported on Freespira treatment for patients with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Ninety percent of patients in this study experienced a significant improvement in PTSD symptoms at two months and six months post-treatment.\n\nSymposium Chair David Tolin, Ph.D., Director of Anxiety Disorders Center, The Institute of Living, and Adjunct Professor of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, commented, \"Studies of the Freespira treatment have shown that this innovative approach to treating patients suffering from panic symptoms and panic attacks not only significantly reduces or eliminates these symptoms in approximately 80% of patients, but also results in meaningful reduction in health costs.\"\n\nDebra Reisenthel, CEO of Palo Alto Health Sciences, added, \"Patients with panic symptoms and panic attacks have 3-5 times higher medical costs than patients without panic due to higher utilization of medical resources, including ED visits, physician visits and prescription drugs.\"\n\nFreespira is both easy to use and effective. Once a licensed healthcare provider authorizes the treatment and after a single training session, the patient uses Freespira at home, performing two 17-minute breathing sessions a day over a four-week period, after which the treatment is complete. The peer-reviewed published multi-center Freespira clinical trial, presented by Dr. Tolin, demonstrated that 71% of patients were panic attack free immediately after treatment and 79% of patients were panic attack free 12 months post-treatment.\n\nAbout Freespira\n\nFreespira is an FDA-cleared, drug-free, four-week at-home treatment for panic attacks and other panic symptoms. Treatment is authorized and completed under the supervision of a licensed healthcare provider. Freespira is clinically proven to reduce or eliminate panic attacks and other symptoms of panic disorder, a mental health condition in which debilitating anxiety leads to life-altering avoidance behaviors. Individuals with panic chronically hyperventilate, even when not experiencing a panic attack. This abnormal breathing pattern has been shown to exacerbate attacks. Freespira works by training the patient to stabilize respiration rate and exhaled carbon dioxide levels, which reduces or eliminates panic attacks.\n\nAbout Palo Alto Health Sciences, Inc.\n\nPalo Alto Health Sciences, Inc. is a privately held digital therapeutic company revolutionizing behavioral healthcare with evidence-based, non-invasive, drug-free solutions. Their first product, Freespira, is an FDA-cleared treatment for individuals suffering from panic disorder, panic attacks and other symptoms of panic. In the United States, over 6.7 million adults annually suffer from panic disorder; panic attacks affect a total of 27 million adults in the U.S. every year and are a common component of other anxiety disorders.\n\nFreespira is commercially available throughout the U.S. To learn more, visit http://www.freespira.com or contact info@pahealthsciences.com.", "question": "Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The device has apparently been commercially available for many years but this is not specifically addressed in the release.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "A new study from The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston has revealed that a treatment taken daily by people who have had organ transplants to prevent organ rejection protects against Alzheimer's disease. An early online version of this paper detailing the findings has been published and is scheduled for publication in the July 7 issue of the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.\n\nAlzheimer's disease is the most common age-associated neurodegenerative disorder that has no cure. Compelling evidence shows that toxic protein aggregates called A\u03b2 oligomers selectively target and disrupt the points of communication between brain cells, impairing memory in people suffering from the disease. Because of this, there is a large consensus that preventing this kind of toxicity would be an effective treatment strategy.\n\nCalcineurin is an enzyme that regulates communication between brain cells and memory formation. The UTMB research team and others have shown previously that this enzyme plays a central role in the harmful effects of the A\u03b2 oligomers and that elevated calcineurin is found in the nervous system of Alzheimer's patients.\n\nUsing a mouse model of Alzheimer's, the researchers earlier showed that blocking calcineurin restored memory function. However, the question of whether such a strategy would prevent the onset and progression of Alzheimer's in people is challenging because treatment with a calcineurin-blocking agent suppresses the immune system.\n\nTo bypass this issue, the UTMB team analyzed data from the medical records of 2,644 patients who received organ transplants and must take calcineurin inhibitor-based medications, such as Tacrolimus or cyclosporine, for the rest of their lives to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ. As part of the medical care for transplant recipients, any evidence of memory impairment or dementia is immediately noted and monitored, as it can limit treatment compliance among these patients.\n\nThe participants were separated into groups by age at the time of last visit or death, gender and ethnicity. Eight participants showed evidence of dementia - two were younger than 65, five were in the 65-74 years old group and one was in the 75-84 years old group.\n\nThe UTMB study data was compared with national data obtained from the 2014 Alzheimer's Association Facts and Figures dataset on age-matched patients to compare the prevalence of Alzheimer's.\n\n\"These data clearly show that the prevalence of dementia and Alzheimer's in our transplant patient group is significantly lower, in fact almost absent, when compared to national data from the general population,\" said senior author Luca Cicalese, professor in the department of surgery. \"In patients over 65 years, 11 percent of the general population had dementia compared with 1.02 percent of the study subjects. In Americans over 75 years, 15.3 percent of the population had dementia compared with 0.6 percent of the study subjects. Among Americans over 85 years, 32 percent had dementia, although we did not have any patients in this age group with dementia.\"\n\nSince the people involved in the study mostly come from Texas, the researchers further compared their over 65 years old group with the prevalence of Alzheimer's in the general population of the state and got similar results.\n\n\"Taken together, our findings from these people confirm the data obtained with animal models and support, for the first time in human subjects, our notion that calcineurin inhibition has a protective effect on the development and possible progression and even reversal of Alzheimer's disease,\" said senior author Giulio Taglialatela, Professor and Vice Chair for Research in the department of neurology and director of UTMB's Mitchell Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases. \"Therefore, we are currently working on devising treatment strategies to obtain the same beneficial effects in AD humans using low doses of calcineurin inhibitors that result in minimal or no immunosuppression, thus limiting possible undesired side effects.\"\n\nUTMB's Cristiana Rastellini, Professor in the departments of Surgery and Microbiology & Immunology also was an author on this paper.\n\nThis research was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the Mitchell Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases.", "question": "Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Although not explicitly stated, it is clear that the drugs in question are available.

Therefore, screening and early detection may be crucial to our efforts to turn the tide against the growing threat of this devastating disease.\"\n\nSteven Verdooner, NeuroVision CEO, said the imaging system leverages the company's expertise in autofluorescence imaging of the retina using a specialized ophthalmic camera and sophisticated image processing software. \"It's exciting to see these studies demonstrating the power of the technology applied to the Alzheimer's field. Our goal is to develop a product that is easy to use, affordable and widely accessible. We look forward to the potential of retinal imaging playing a vital role in solving the problem of Alzheimer's, both in identifying and monitoring those who may be affected by the disease. Our next step is to continue with clinical trials, building upon the existing pharmaceutical company collaborations, to ensure our technology is ready for the medical community to help manage this disease.\"\n\nThe study's first author, Yosef Koronyo, a research associate at Cedars-Sinai and a scientist and inventor at NeuroVision, said the latest findings cap a decade of study that has produced several landmark discoveries. \"In 2010, our research group published an article providing the first evidence for the existence of Alzheimer's-specific plaques in the human retina, and we demonstrated the ability to detect individual plaques in live mouse models using a modified ophthalmic device.\"\n\nAfter adapting the technology for human application, the researchers initiated several ongoing clinical trials in the United States and Australia to determine the feasibility of detecting and quantifying beta-amyloid plaques in patients with the disease.\n\nIn the new article, the researchers report on a 16-patient clinical trial to demonstrate the feasibility of identifying beta-amyloid in the eye using autofluorescence imaging. They also provide detailed analyses and several new findings on Alzheimer's pathology in the retina, results of research with donated eyes and brains of 37 deceased patients, 23 with confirmed Alzheimer's disease and 14 controls.\n\nAmong key findings, the researchers report a 4.7-fold increase in retinal plaque burden in patients with Alzheimer's, compared to controls, and they provide observations regarding geometric distribution and layer location of amyloid pathology in the retina.

The researchers, led by Dale Boger, co-chair of TSRI\u2019s Department of Chemistry, discovered a way to structurally modify vancomycin to make an already-powerful version of the antibiotic even more potent.\n\n\u201cDoctors could use this modified form of vancomycin without fear of resistance emerging,\u201d said Boger, whose team announced the finding today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe original form of vancomycin is an ideal starting place for developing better antibiotics. The antibiotic has been prescribed by doctors for 60 years, and bacteria are only now developing resistance to it. This suggests bacteria already have a hard time overcoming vancomycin\u2019s original \u201cmechanism of action,\u201d which works by disrupting how bacteria form cell walls.\n\nBoger called vancomycin \u201cmagical\u201d for its proven strength against infections, and previous studies by Boger and his colleagues at TSRI had shown that it is possible to add two modifications to vancomycin to make it even more potent. \u201cWith these modifications, you need less of the drug to have the same effect,\u201d Boger said.\n\nThe new study shows that scientists can make a third modification\u2014which interferes with a bacterium\u2019s cell wall in a new way\u2014with promising results. Combined with the previous modifications, this alteration gives vancomycin a 1,000-fold increase in activity, meaning doctors would need to use less of the antibiotic to fight infection.\n\nThe discovery makes this version of vancomycin the first antibiotic to have three independent mechanisms of action. \u201cThis increases the durability of this antibiotic,\u201d said Boger. \u201cOrganisms just can\u2019t simultaneously work to find a way around three independent mechanisms of action. Even if they found a solution to one of those, the organisms would still be killed by the other two.\u201d\n\nTested against Enterococci bacteria, the new version of vancomycin killed both vancomycin-resistant Enterococci and the original forms of Enterococci.\n\nThe next step in this research is to design a way to synthesize the modified vancomycin using fewer steps in the lab, as the current method takes 30 steps. But Boger calls this the \u201ceasy part\u201d of the project, compared with the challenge of designing the molecule in the first place.\n\nEven if the process isn\u2019t streamlined, Boger believes the new vancomycin\u2019s lifesaving powers make its production valuable. \u201cAntibiotics are total cures for bacterial infections,\u201d said Boger. \u201cMaking this molecule is important, even by the current approach, if the failure of antibiotics continues.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Boger, authors of the study, \u201cPeripheral modifications of [\u03a8[CH2NH]Tpg4]vancomycin with added synergistic mechanisms of action provide durable and potent antibiotics,\u201d included first author Akinori Okano and Nicholas A. Isley, both of TSRI.\n\nThe study was supported by the National Institutes of Health (grants F32 GM114948 and CA041101).\n\nThe Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) is one of the world's largest independent, not-for-profit organizations focusing on research in the biomedical sciences.

MorNuCo Laboratories is elated to share these results with the public, as early detection is widely considered the corner stone of an effective strategy to reduce cancer-related deaths.\n\nMalignant mesothelioma is an aggressive and almost uniformly fatal tumor caused primarily by exposure to asbestos. In this study, the serum presence of a mesothelioma-specific form of the ENOX2 protein (a recently identified marker of malignancy) was found within the serum of asbestos-exposed individuals an average of 6.2 years in advance of clinical symptoms by using the ONCOblot tissue of origin cancer detection test.\n\nSerum samples that were collected from asbestos-exposed individuals prior to the development of mesothelioma as part of a cancer surveillance program were tested for ENOX2 protein presence to determine how long in advance of clinical symptoms that the mesothelioma-specific ENOX2 protein transcript variants could be detected.\n\nThe results of this study showed that two mesothelioma-specific ENOX2 protein transcript variants were detected in the serum of asbestos-exposed individuals 4-10 years prior to clinical diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma, an exciting sign of progress in the cancer detection field.\n\n\"The completion of this trial is an exciting new chapter for our work,\" says Nick Miner, Vice President of Business Development. \"Although asbestos-induced mesothelioma is a very specific example of early detection, we are currently pursuing larger-scale clinical trials to investigate the utility of the ENOX2 protein marker to predict the onset of cancers of other tissues of origin as well.\" Miner continued.\n\nAlthough the fight against cancer often appears to be an overwhelmingly intransigent problem, significant progress is being made regarding the development of additional tools for cancer detection, such as the ONCOblot Test.\n\nThe ONCOblot\u00ae Test was developed and created by Dr. D.

In a study of 195 asymptomatic women with dense breast tissue who had a negative mammogram within the previous 11 months, AB-MR detected five additional cancers after a negative screening mammography, according to preliminary findings from a Penn Medicine team presented this week at the Radiological Society of North America meeting in Chicago.\n\nTo put this in perspective, the cancer detection rate of mammography is roughly 4 cancers in 1,000 women who have a mammogram. Digital tomosynthesis (DBT), or 3D mammography, does slightly better, detecting approximately 25 percent more cancers, or roughly 5 cancers in 1,000 women screened. Based on the preliminary results at Penn Medicine, the cancer detection rate of AB-MR screening is 25 cancers per 1,000 patients. One in eight women in the United States will develop breast cancer at some point during their life.\n\n\"Having dense breast tissue makes it more difficult to detect a cancer on a mammogram,\" said the study's lead author, Susan Weinstein, MD, an associate professor of Radiology and the director of breast MRI at Penn Medicine. \"Based on the literature and our results, women with dense breast tissue who desire supplemental screening, these results suggest that AB-MR may be a better option than other supplemental screening tests such as whole breast ultrasound.\n\nThe most common exam offered for asymptomatic patients seeking supplemental screening is a whole breast screening ultrasound examination. However, screening ultrasound examinations have higher rates of false positives, meaning more cases of positive screenings where no cancer is present.\n\nBased on the results from Penn's study, the AB-MR may be a better option. American Cancer Society guidelines currently recommend a full breast MRI, not an AB-MR, in women who, based on family history of breast or ovarian cancer and/or previous treatment for Hodgkin disease, have a 20 to 25 percent or greater lifetime risk of breast cancer.\n\nIn addition to Weinstein, additional authors include Mitchell D.

However, CT scans don't always detect concussion.\n\n\"Over 90% of CT scans (for concussion) are negative. And you get 200 times the radiation of a chest X-ray. It's expensive; it's not terrific,\" said Hank Nordhoff, chairman and CEO of Banyan Biomarkers, maker of the new test. It can help determine whether a patient further needs a CT scan, based on a physician's concerns.\n\n\"Today's action supports the FDA's Initiative to Reduce Unnecessary Radiation Exposure from Medical Imaging -- an effort to ensure that each patient is getting the right imaging exam, at the right time, with the right radiation dose,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nThe test could also help reduce costs significantly. Where a CT scan can cost $800 to $1,500, Nordhoff predicts that the new test would cost closer to $150. The test would be available to hospitals, Nordhoff said, and he hopes a handheld sideline device could be commercially available in the near future. The FDA approved the test as part of its breakthrough devices program after evaluating a clinical study of 1,900 blood samples from people thought to have concussion or mild traumatic brain injury. The clinical trials did not include any children, though Banyan plans to include them in future studies. When compared with a CT scan, the blood test was 97.5% as effective in detecting concussion and 99.6% effective in ruling out concussion. \"A blood test that accurately, reliably and consistently detects the presence of brain proteins that appear in the blood after a brain injury is a major advance,\" said Dr. David Dodick, a fellow of the American Academy of Neurology who specializes in sports medicine and neurology. He was not involved in the development of the test. Though Dodick was optimistic about the blood test, he said a lot of work still needs to be done in understanding and diagnosing brain injury. He pointed out that we need better measurements to understand when brains have fully healed from trauma, as well as a better understanding of how these biomarkers act which may actually affect prognosis. It's also unknown how this test can determine subconcussive hits, \"hits that don't cause symptoms but do cause a brain injury,\" he explained. \"These occur much more often than actual concussions, especially in certain collision and contact sports,.\" Subconcussive or repeated hits to the head are believed to be the root of the neurodegenerative disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. In fact, Banyan has partnered with another company, Quanterix, to help develop a test that could eventually detect the impact of repeated hits. Quanterix aims to combine the biomarkers with Banyan with digital technology that can look at the proteins at a super microscopic level and pinpoint low level concentrations of the proteins. \"The key now is to use this sensitivity to evolve in more brain health and to protect athletes and keep soldiers out of harms way,\" said Kevin Hrusovsky, president and CEO of Quanterix.

The FDA believes that using the new blood test, imaging can be avoided in at least a third of patients who are suspected of having a concussion.

It affects about 700,000 Americans, according to the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation (CCF).\n\nThe illness causes inflammation, irritation, swelling and sores on the lining of the large intestine. Symptoms include diarrhea with blood or pus and abdominal discomfort, according to CCF.\n\n\"There is still a substantial unmet need for new treatments for patients with ulcerative colitis,\" said study lead author Dr. William Sandborn. He is professor of medicine and chief of the division of gastroenterology at the University of California, San Diego.\n\nXeljanz targets certain proteins involved in the body's inflammatory and immune responses that other so-called biologic drugs don't, the researchers said.\n\n\"Treatment with oral tofacitinib is potentially a new treatment option for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, pending review by the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration],\" Sandborn said.\n\nThe study was funded by Pfizer, Inc., the maker of Xeljanz. Sandborn said he has received research grants from the company and served as a consultant for Pfizer.\n\nWhether Xeljanz should be used as a first treatment is still not clear, said Dr. Arun Swaminath, director of the inflammatory bowel disease program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\nBecause Xeljanz comes as a pill, it could have an advantage for patients, Swaminath said. But so far it has only been tried with patients who have not responded to other treatments, he said.\n\n\"How it is used in the real world may be different than how it was used in these studies,\" Swaminath said. \"I am not going out on a limb and say this should be the first choice, because we don't have enough data to say that's the way it should be positioned.\"\n\nThe researchers randomly assigned more than 1,700 people with ulcerative colitis to one of three phase 3 trials.\n\nThe first two trials looked at more than 1,100 patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who had failed with conventional treatment or treatment with newer \"tumor necrosis factor antagonist\" drugs, such as Remicade (infliximab). They received Xeljanz or a placebo twice a day for eight weeks.\n\nIn the third trial, nearly 600 patients who responded to Xeljanz were assigned to a maintenance dose (one group with 5 milligrams [mg] and another group with 10 mg) of the drug, or placebo for a year.\n\nIn the first trial, nearly 19 percent of the patients taking Xeljanz experienced a remission of their condition in eight weeks. That compared to just 8 percent of patients receiving placebo.\n\nIn the second trial, almost 17 percent of those taking Xeljanz had a remission, compared with nearly 4 percent of those taking placebo, the researchers found.\n\nIn the third trial, more than 34 percent of patients taking 5 mg of Xeljanz had disease remission after one year. Forty percent of those taking a 10-mg dose of the drug had remission at a year. Only 11 percent of patients on placebo saw a remission.\n\nHowever, in all of the trials, more patients taking Xeljanz suffered from infections, such as shingles, than those receiving placebo, researchers found.\n\nIn addition, five patients taking Xeljanz developed nonmelanoma skin cancer, compared with one patient receiving placebo. Five patients taking the drug experienced heart problems compared with no one on the placebo.\n\nAlso, compared with placebo, Xeljanz was associated with an increase in levels of cholesterol.\n\nThe report was published May 4 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nDr. Sonia Friedman is an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. She's also the author of an editorial accompanying the study.\n\n\"Tofacitinib is a promising new class of medical therapy that has efficacy in ulcerative colitis. It is an oral, small-molecule drug that is different from current biologic therapies, such as infliximab [Remicade], adalimumab [Humira], golimumab [Simponi] and vedolizumab [Entyvio],\" Friedman said.\n\nAn advantage of Xeljanz is that it is a pill. Other biologic drugs are given by infusion or injection. In addition, patients cannot develop antibodies to Xeljanz as they can with other biologic drugs, Friedman said.\n\n\"Tofacitinib may be used in the future as rescue therapy from failure of biologics,\" she said. \"Only future studies will determine whether it can be used as initial therapy for ulcerative colitis and what patients it would help the most.\"\n\nFor more information on ulcerative colitis, visit the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story makes clear both that Xeljanz is already on the market for treating arthritis and that it has not yet been approved by the FDA for use in treating ulcerative colitis.\u00a0It would have been helpful to note if some doctors currently prescribe Xeljanz as an off-label treatment for ulcerative colitis.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "In UCLA-led study, new treatment is more effective in people receiving immunotherapy for the first time\n\nA UCLA-led study has found that a treatment that uses a bacteria-like agent in combination with an immunotherapy drug could help some people with advanced melanoma, an aggressive form of skin cancer, live longer.\n\nThe research showed that using the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab and the experimental agent SD-101, a sequence of nucleic acids that mimics a bacterial infection, altered the microenvironment around the tumor in a way that enabled the immune system to more effectively attack the cancer. The research was an early-stage study, conducted to test the side effects and best dosage of a potential new combined therapy, and the findings were published today in the journal Cancer Discovery.\n\nPembrolizumab, which is marketed under the brand name Keytruda, works by blocking a protein called PD-1, which interferes with immune system function. Blocking PD-1 with pembrolizumab enables the immune system cells to better attack the cancer. While pembrolizumab has been a significant advancement for treating people with a variety of advanced or metastatic cancers, a majority of metastatic melanoma tumors are still resistant to the drug.\n\n\"We have found that the reason patients with metastatic melanoma do not initially respond to immunotherapy with an anti-PD-1 is that their immune system was not ready,\" said Dr. Antoni Ribas, the study's lead author, a professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and director of the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center Tumor Immunology Program. \"So we thought, 'What if we change that by injecting the therapy drug into the metastatic lesions and change the microenvironment of the cancer?'\n\n\"It's like having a pile of wood but not having a match to light it. With this new approach, SD-101 is the match that starts the fire.\"\n\nThe researchers found that SD-101 not only directs T cells to cancer cells, but it also makes the microenvironment more hospitable for the T cells, so that they can better kill the cancer cells.\n\nAll 22 people in the study had an advanced stage of inoperable or metastatic melanoma. Nine were receiving an immunotherapy treatment for the first time as part of the study. Seven of those nine had a positive response to the drug combination, including two for whom the tumors disappeared completely.\n\nThe other 13 people in the study had previously received a type of immunotherapy before the study. Of them, two had a partial response, meaning parts of the tumors shrank, but the tumors did not go away completely. Five more showed some reduction in the tumors, but the other participants did respond to the therapy.\n\nThe results of the study suggest that the combination of pembrolizumab and SD-101 could provide an alternative treatment for people with melanoma whose tumors have not responded or would be unlikely to respond to other therapies.\n\n\"For all patients with advanced cancer, immunotherapy using PD-1 inhibitors has really changed the face of cancer treatment. Unfortunately, this therapy still only works in a subset of patients,\" said Dr. Deborah Wong, assistant clinical professor of medicine at the Geffen School of Medicine and an oncologist at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, who was also an author of the paper.\n\n\"This particular combination has been especially gratifying because not only does the SD-101 therapy drug induce tumor shrinkage at the actual site where it's injected, but it's working in conjunction with pembrolizumab to shrink tumors outside of the ones we're directly injecting.\"\n\nThe study highlights the need for more research into combination therapies like this one, because many people with cancer do not respond to immunotherapy or experience a reoccurrence of their tumors after treatment.\n\n\"We are really starting to understand the science of how immunotherapies work in patients,\" said Ribas, who is also the director of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy Center at UCLA. \"By understanding that, we can find more ways to make that therapy more active. One way is by combining the therapy with another agent that can overcome the resistance that some cancers have to these therapies.\"\n\nThe study was funded by Dynavax Technologies Corp., which provided SD-101.

He reviewed the findings for WebMD.\n\nMore than 1.5 million cataract surgeries are performed annually in the U.S. One in three mostly older Americans will have the surgery at some point in their lives.\n\nThe surgery is performed to remove the natural lens of the eye after it has become clouded over time. A permanent artificial lens is then implanted to replace the natural lens and provide appropriate vision correction for each patient.\n\nCurrently, most aspects of cataract surgery, including the initial incision and the breakup and removal of the clouded lens from the lens capsule, are performed manually by the surgeon. An ultrasound instrument with a vibrating needle is used to break up the cataracts, and a vacuum sucks them out.\n\nThe new studies looked at using the so-called femtosecond laser to deliver near-infrared light to fragment the cataract into tiny segments prior to removal.\n\n\"The idea is that all the surgeon will have to do is remove the pieces with a vacuum,\" says researcher Mark Packer, MD, of Oregon Health and Sciences University in Portland. \"Ideally, you won't need ultrasound, or at least you'll need less ultrasound.\"\n\nThat's important because ultrasound can cause collateral damage to the eye, he says.

Tests quickly revealed she had acute myeloid leukemia \u2014 a type of blood cancer that progresses quickly \u2014 and doctors told her that chemotherapy would probably not be enough; she would need a bone-marrow transplant.\n\nQuinn, who has a science background, knew that finding a donor would be difficult. In college, she had donated to a bone-marrow registry after learning that people like her, with a mixed racial heritage, have a much harder time than others finding a match.\n\nIn fact, when she and her doctors scoured the registry for a match for her, only one name came up: her own.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry,\u201d Quinn said.\n\nWhile searching unsuccessfully for a match for five months, Quinn underwent four cycles of chemotherapy to keep the leukemia at bay. What eventually saved her, though, was an experimental transplant using stem cells from the blood of a baby\u2019s umbilical cord, an approach that can be used without perfectly matching blood types.\n\nThis therapy and another \u2014 haploidentical transplantation, which uses bone-marrow cells that are only half-matched to a patient \u2014 have revolutionized the treatment of blood cancers in the past few years. Every biological child is a half-match for a parent, and vice versa.\n\n\u201cMany patients who previously died for lack of a match are now cured of their underlying malignancy,\u201d said Richard Jones, director of the bone-marrow transplant program at Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center.\n\nBone-marrow transplants, which infuse healthy blood cells taken from a donor, are used when chemotherapy and radiation fail to stop cancerous blood cells from taking over and ultimately destroying a person\u2019s immune system.\n\nThe transplant can be taken from either the blood or bone marrow, which produces blood cells. The procedure is typically preceded by high doses of chemotherapy and radiation that wipe out the patient\u2019s faulty blood cells and replace them with healthy ones from a donor.\n\nThe process is dangerous because it leaves a patient vulnerable to life-threatening infection for months before the reconstituted immune system begins to work.\n\nIn the past, a patient\u2019s body would reject as a foreign intruder anything but a perfect or near-perfect match, a usually fatal development. Umbilical-cord stem cells, however, are sort of a blank slate because they haven\u2019t been exposed to much life \u2014 such as bacteria and viruses \u2014 and thus are more easily accepted even if they aren\u2019t a perfect match.\n\nWhen Quinn\u2019s doctors found no match on the donor registry, she turned to a clinical trial examining the safety of taking blood cells from umbilical cords, expanding their numbers in a laboratory and then infusing them into patients.\n\nBecause each umbilical cord produces only a tiny number of stem cells, umbilical-cord transplants take longer to work than standard transplants, which makes patients more likely to get fatal infections. And if cells from several umbilical cords are used, the chances of immunity problems increase.\n\nThis expanded cord-blood technique has been a \u201chuge home run\u201d for patients, said Colleen Delaney of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, who helped create it.\n\n\u201cNo one had successfully taken stem cells and gotten them to grow and put back in a person,\u201d she said. The advance should be particularly valuable for minorities and people of mixed-race background, whose chances of finding a matched donor were slim to none.\n\n\u201cThis is where cord blood becomes an amazing and beautiful resource,\u201d Delaney said. \u201cWe can find cord-blood donors for 99 percent of patients who cannot find a donor.\u201d\n\nQuinn was hospitalized for 30 days, and she said the recovery was difficult but relatively uneventful. Mostly she had to deal with overwhelming fatigue for the first year. She also developed graft-versus-host disease, which caused rashes when her skin was exposed to the sun. But she has been free of cancer for five years.\n\nShe remembers learning that she had leukemia and assuming that she would soon die.\n\n\u201cIt still gives me pause \u2014 I went to Costa Rica \u2014 that I am able to travel and went backpacking and kayaking,\u201d Quinn says. \u201cI was so sure I would never get to do those things again. It\u2019s an indescribable feeling.\u201d\n\nIn haploidential transplants, rather than wiping out the patient\u2019s immune system, doctors use just enough drugs to suppress it. This reduces the risk of damaging organs or causing a rejection of the donated marrow.\n\n\u201cParents are always haploidentical. Children are always haploidentical,\u201d Jones said. \u201cSiblings are half the time and all second-degree relatives (grandchildren, nieces, nephews) have a 50 percent chance of being a half-match. . . . Everybody now has a donor, and that is a major advance.\u201d\n\nYet doctors and patients may not be aware there are choices other than conventional bone-marrow transplants, Jones said.\n\n\u201cDespite the recent data showing equivalency of half-matched and cord-blood transplants with conventional matched transplants, many cancer doctors and even some transplant doctors still consider these newer transplants not standard practice,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere are still lots of patients in need of transplants that are not getting them because of lack of matched donors, and that is unacceptable in the year 2016.\u201d\n\nJones estimates that about 7,500 transplants of donated stem cells were done in 2014 \u2014 primarily for leukemia and lymphoma but also for nonmalignant blood disorders such as sickle cell and aplastic anemia \u2014 but that more than 15,000 could easily be done annually if more doctors embraced the new methods now available.\n\nGregg Gordon, 44, developed leukemia in 2011. He noticed two bumps under his shin and had been feeling unusually tired. He went to his internist, who drew blood and within 24 hours Gordon was in the hospital receiving chemotherapy.\n\nHis wife, Caryn, recalls how little they knew about his disease \u2014 acute myeloid leukemia \u2014 as doctors discussed treatment with them.\n\n\u201cWe knew it would be a very long journey to battle this disease,\u201d Caryn Gordon said. \u201cHe decided he would be focused on being the patient and said, \u2018Do whatever you have to do with me because I want to walk my girls [who were then 12 and 16] down the aisle.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOn advice of their hematologist, the Gordons traveled to Hutchinson, which has established a national reputation as a bone-marrow transplant center, but quickly discovered there was no good donor match.\n\n\u201cWe thought we would find a match. It was extraordinarily shocking to us that it was impossible,\u201d Caryn recalled.\n\nAccording to Be the Match, which operates the national donor program, a patient\u2019s likelihood of finding a donor match on their registry ranges from 66 to 97 percent, depending on ethnic background.\n\nBut Gregg Gordon was able to participate in Delaney\u2019s clinical trial and, like Quinn, received lab-expanded cord blood following intensive chemotherapy and radiation. He also will be five years cancer-free in September.\n\nNot everyone is as lucky.

The guidelines say that doctors may consider elective induction at 41 weeks and should proceed with it at 42 weeks. But the question has some doctors reconsidering their assumptions about induction and has sparked criticism by women who contend there is already too much interference with uncomplicated pregnancies.\n\nThe question was presented in May at the yearly ACOG meeting in Washington: \u201cWhy not induce everyone at 39 weeks?\u201d Two doctors had been asked to debate: Errol Norwitz, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Tufts University School of Medicine, and Charles Lockwood, dean of the Morsani College of Medicine at the University of South Florida.\n\n[Here\u2019s what\u2019s being done to lower the maternal death rate]\n\n\u201cMy original assumption when asked to participate in this debate,\u201d Lockwood said, \u201cwas that Dr. Norwitz would take the \u2018pro\u2019 side since he has written about the risk of stillbirth after 38 weeks, and I would take the \u2018con\u2019 side since older literature suggested that C-section rates would likely be higher in the elective induction of labor at 39 weeks.\u201d\n\nNorwitz was a vigorous proponent. \u201cThere is no benefit to the fetus waiting beyond 39 weeks in well-dated pregnancies,\u201d he told the doctors. And as Lockwood reviewed research, he found that he was more and more in agreement with that point of view.\n\n\u201cBut Errol and I decided we would not tell each other which side we were taking in order to conduct independent assessments of the literature and report on our conclusions,\u201d Lockwood said. \u201cBeyond adding an element of suspense, this strategy allowed us to come to unbiased conclusions.\u201d\n\nAfter Lockwood found that recent studies suggest that elective inductions at 39 weeks decrease Caesarean delivery rates and might reduce the rate of infant and maternal complications, what was supposed to be a debate proceeded as a discussion in support of induction.\n\nBefore either doctor spoke, the audience in a crowded ballroom was polled: 63 percent opposed having most women deliver at 39 weeks, 20 percent supported it and 17 percent were unsure.\n\nNorwitz argued against simply letting nature take its course.\n\n\u201cNature is a terrible obstetrician,\u201d he said, referring to the \u201ccontinuum\u201d of pregnancy and birth: the large number of zygotes that never implant, the 75 percent lost before 20 weeks, and stillbirth.\n\nAnd, he said, the risk of stillbirth and neurological injuries rises after 39 weeks. \u201cStillbirth is a hugely underappreciated problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are anywhere between 25,000 to 30,000 stillbirths a year in the United States.\u201d\n\nLockwood and Norwitz\u2019s support for induction at 39 weeks not only surprised many of the doctors at the session, it also upset those who believe less intervention is the safest route for mother and baby.\n\nLabor may be induced by breaking the amniotic sac or by using hormones called prostaglandins or medication such as oxytocin, which can set off contractions. Labor can begin immediately or take a day or two; if it becomes too lengthy, Caesareans are performed.\n\nCristen Pascucci, an advocate for giving women more control over childbirth decisions, thinks the doctors\u2019 remarks suggest that all babies need to be \u201crescued by birth,\u201d creating an anti-woman mentality. \u201cIt\u2019s as if women and their babies are fundamentally in opposition to each other and the female body is dangerous by design,\u201d said Pascucci, a vice president of the advocacy group Improving Birth.\n\nPascucci, who is based in Lexington, Ky., travels the country speaking and consultingon issues related to birth rights. She said the induction recommendation \u201creinforces a century-old, pre-feminist American obstetric view that birth is pathological and the doctor\u2019s job is to extract the fetus from the incubator \u2014 like in the \u201950s, when every baby was pulled out of its shackled, unconscious mother by episiotomy.\u201d\n\nConsumer groups such as hers, she said, have been calling on ACOG to evolve toward care that is more centered on women. \u201cIt\u2019s disheartening to see how hard that\u2019s going to be for some physicians to do.\u201d\n\nLockwood and Norwitz are aware that there is strong opposition to induction at 39 weeks. \u201cI think a lot of this gets very emotional,\u201d Norwitz said.\n\nAlthough both doctors support induction at 39 weeks for all healthy pregnancies, Lockwood said that obstetricians shouldn\u2019t routinely adopt the practice just yet. As with any change in standard medical care, extensive research is needed before it can be safely and widely adopted. Even so, Norwitz thinks that \u201cit\u2019s a very healthy discussion to have.\u201d\n\nDue dates are calculated 40 weeks from the first day of a woman\u2019s normal menstrual period and, according to ACOG, full term is defined as a pregnancy that lasts between 39 weeks and 40 weeks and six days.\n\nAs he prepared for the debate, Lockwood created a micro-simulation model to predict the outcome of various care decisions, and results suggested lower rates of stillbirth, Caesarean delivery and maternal and neonatal complications for elective induction at 39 weeks. That prompted him to take the debate stage as a proponent of early induction.\n\nStill, he was surprised by an audience poll at the end of the discussion: 70 percent now supported the idea that women deliver at 39 weeks, 21 percent remained unsure and only 9 percent were against the idea.\n\n[I didn\u2019t understand the pressure to have a C-section until I was about to deliver]\n\nTraditional medical thinking assumes that early induction could lead to higher infection rates and the need for a Caesarean. But Norwitz said the evidence doesn\u2019t support that. Rather, he said, the latest literature suggests that the drugs available to soften the cervix in preparation for contractions help to decrease the Caesarean risk, adding a small caveat: For a small number of first-time mothers with \u201cunfavorable, long and hard cervixes\u201d \u2014 as opposed to cervixes that are soft and receptive to induction \u2014 the risk of Caesarean is increased.\n\nRebecca Dekker, who has a doctorate in nursing and founded the website Evidence Based Birth, which aims to make research on childbirth more accessible to families and professionals, watched a live stream of the session and described the presentations as misleading and the research as flawed. She called it \u201cconcerning and rash\u201d for doctors at the meeting to make \u201cbroad conclusions\u201d that \u201ccould potentially affect at least 3 million women a year in the United States alone.\u201d\n\nNorwitz said that the presentations were evidence-based. \u201cThis is my interpretation of the published literature,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a personal opinion based on belief or ideology.\u201d\n\nLockwood said he finds push-back inevitable and part of the broader scientific process.\n\nDekker said there were flaws in the research showing that women who received elective induction had lower rates of Caesarean delivery. For the women who waited for labor to start on its own, about half ended up being induced for medical complications. \u201cThey still analyzed the data as if the women had spontaneous labor, so it sways the results of the studies,\u201d she said.\n\nDekker isn\u2019t disputing that there are about 25,000 stillbirths per year or that this is a concern. However, she said a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report shows about half of stillbirths occur between 20 and 27 weeks of pregnancy, and the other half at later points.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that a blanket policy of 39-week inductions would not affect all of the stillbirths that happen before 39 weeks,\u201d Dekker said, adding that the CDC report concludes, \u201cDespite intensive investigations, for a substantial number of fetal deaths a specific cause of death cannot be determined.\u201d\n\nAnd, Dekker said, the public has the misconception that inductions are simple, noninvasive procedures. Pitocin, the most commonly used drug for induction, is classified as a high-alert medication that can increase the risk of patient harm if an error occurs. The drug can cause contractions that are too frequent, increasing the risk of decreased blood flow and oxygen to the baby, she said. Also, the drug can cause the placenta to detach from the uterine wall too early, and it can cause the uterine wall to tear.\n\nFor Dekker, the major benefit of spontaneous labor is avoiding the risks of a medical induction.\n\nThere are clear philosophical differences. One early morning in his hospital\u2019s labor and delivery unit, Norwitz said, he spoke with a midwife colleague who compared labor to walking through a forest. \u201cWe midwives stand behind the patient, and if she gets off the path, we coax her back onto it,\u201d she told him. \u201cObstetricians are in front of her, hacking through the forest.\u201d\n\nEsther Hausman, a certified nurse midwife in Concord, Mass., argues for restraint. \u201cSince we don\u2019t know exactly what triggers labor, why mess with it?\u201d\n\nHausman suggested learning from countries such as Denmark or Sweden, where midwifery is the first line of care and where fetal and maternal mortality rates are lower than in the United States. In a 2014 CDC report, the U.S. infant mortality rate (6.1 per 1,000 births) put it in 26th place among a selection of developed countries. Finland and Japan had the lowest rates (2.3 per 1,000 births.)\n\nDekker said that the ACOG debate should have instead compared the medical model of care to midwife-led care. Midwives are less likely than doctors to induce a woman electively, she said, and studies have found they intervene less than doctors and have more-satisfied patients.\n\nBeverly Siegal, a retired obstetrician-gynecologist in Newton, Mass., attended the debate and was among those who changed their thinking on induction.\n\n\u201cWhat changed [my opinion] at the end of the presentation was the really convincing argument that there is nothing gained for the baby to stay in beyond 39 weeks,\u201d Siegal said. \u201cI would personally recommend that any woman with a favorable cervix at 39 weeks be encouraged to get induced.\u201d\n\nOf course, Lockwood said, women should be heard.\n\n\u201cFinally, needless to say, it is expectant mothers that should have the final say as to whether to let nature take its course or undertake this potentially salutary but clearly artificial intervention,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut obviously our messages \u2014 how you talk \u2014 does make a difference,\u201d Norwitz said.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Since the discussion centers on when to induce labor, it is clear that treatments to induce labor are widely available.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Even as a pigtailed child, Ashley Gallagher was self-conscious about a certain fullness in her face. \u201cI was cute as button \u2014 and there was my double chin,\u201d she said.\n\nAs an adult, she faithfully performed facial exercises purported to tighten the area under the chin.

Even participants who had normal-range blood pressure, triglycerides or cholesterol levels before surgery saw improved measures.\n\nNearly a third of all children and teens are overweight or obese in the U.S., and an estimated 4 to 7 percent have severe obesity. The greater a person's obesity, the greater their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and organ damage.\n\nThe findings are important because many of the participants in this study likely already had some level of cardiac damage, such as thickened arteries or heart walls, says Geetha Raghuveer, a pediatric cardiologist at Children's Mercy Kansas City in Missouri who was not involved in the study.\n\n\"If you have very high blood pressure or lipids [cholesterol] or diabetes, you do see cardiovascular changes even at a very young age,\" Raghuveer says. \"They may not be having a heart attack or stroke in their teens and 20s, but they're closer to having those in their 30s and 40s.\"\n\nAmong 242 teens in the study, 161 of them underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure, 67 underwent a vertical sleeve gastrectomy and 14 received an adjustable gastric banding. The study authors had no part in which procedures the teens received. They collected data from the five participating medical centers for their observational study, and decisions about procedures depended on each center's clinical practices.\n\nThe teens, ages 15 to 18 when the study began, had a body mass index (BMI) between 34 and 88, with half over 51. Medical providers use BMI, the ratio of a person's weight to height, to estimate body fat. A BMI over 25 is considered overweight; over 30 is obese. The obesity classification with the highest risks of health problems is a BMI of 40 or higher.\n\nThe risk factors measured in the study included elevated blood pressure (above 120/80 mg/Hg), high cholesterol, high insulin levels in the blood and abnormally high levels of C-reactive protein, an indicator of inflammation in the body. The higher a person's insulin levels are, the more likely they are to have or develop insulin resistance, which can increase blood sugar levels and diabetes risk. High insulin levels may also contribute to increased blood pressure and increase the risk of atherosclerosis, when fat clogs the arteries.\n\nThree years after surgery, teens who underwent a gastric bypass had a 27 percent drop in their BMI, similar to the 26 percent drop in those who had the sleeve gastrectomy. Those with the gastric band had an 8 percent drop in BMI.\n\nBefore surgery, only 3 percent of the teens had no cardiac risk factors at all, but three years later, just over half of them (52 percent) had no risk factors. Just 5 percent had all four cardiac risk factors before their surgeries, but none had all of them three years later. In fact, the majority of the participants \u2014 83 percent \u2014 had only one or no risk factors three years after their surgeries. The proportion of participants with two or three risk factors also dropped substantially.\n\n\"One of the surprises was that almost all patients benefited as a result of the surgery,\" says M. James Lenhard, the medical director of Christiana Care Health System's Diabetes & Metabolic Diseases Center in Wilmington, Del., who was not involved in the study. The average BMI three years after surgery was 39, still considered very obese, he says. \"And yet they still had significant improvements in cardiovascular risk factors,\" Lenhard says. \"The results were impressive.\"\n\nThe study's biggest limitation is its very selective population. Most of the participants were female, most were white, and most received the gastric bypass. Children of color have the greatest risk of obesity, heart disease and Type 2 diabetes, but it's not clear whether they would see the same improvement with these procedures. Lenhard expects the \"odds are very good\" that they would, and Raghuveer \"would be cautiously optimistic\" that the findings would be similar regardless of sex or ethnicity.\n\nThe population also included only teens with the greatest obesity who were also unsuccessful trying other weight loss methods.\n\n\"Severe obesity is notoriously difficult to treat with anything other than surgery,\" Lenhard says. \"The results of this study suggest that performing surgery at a BMI even lower than 52 would provide even better outcomes.\"\n\nAn estimated 1,600 adolescents undergo metabolic or bariatric surgeries each year, the study notes, but families should only consider such procedures after exhausting other treatment options.\n\n\"This is not a procedure you would consider for any obese patient who walks through the door,\" Raghuveer says. \"It would be considered for the highly obese and those not responding to any behavioral modifications, physical activity or calorie restriction.\"\n\nBefore undergoing bariatric surgery, teens and their families receive extensive counseling, Michalsky says.\n\n\"Teens considering bariatric surgery should have a frank discussion with their family and primary care provider and seek detailed information from well-established bariatric surgery centers that are specifically dedicated to treating adolescents,\" he adds.\n\nAll three procedures carry the same risks as any surgical procedure, such as infections, blood clots and bleeding, Lenhard said, and a common risk of sleeve gastrectomy is bleeding where the stomach is reconnected. People who have a gastric bypass often have nutritional and vitamin deficiencies, Lenhard said. And gastric banding has low effectiveness and a risk of the band slipping down the stomach.\n\nGetting longer term data is important, too. Three years is a good follow-up time for this type of study, and it has many more participants than similar studies.\n\n\"However, three years is not a long time overall in the life of a child,\" Raghuveer says. \"I'd be curious what happens to these kids at 10 years, 15 years later.\"\n\nMichalsky says the study is ongoing, and they expect to continuing gathering information for years to come.\n\nIdeally, public health efforts should aim for better obesity prevention, including parent education and interventions when children are toddlers and preschoolers, according to Raghuveer. \"A generational divide\" has left fewer families knowing how to fix meals, she says, and more families need to learn to cook and avoid packaged foods and microwave dinners.\n\n\"The big question is, how do we prevent obese kids from getting to this point where they would need an invasive surgical procedure?\" Raghuveer says. \"The bigger message should be that we should get to a point in society where we are not managing obesity, but we are preventing obesity.\"\n\nTara Haelle is the co-author of The Informed Parent: A Science-Based Resource for Your Child's First Four Years.

Recent findings point to the benefits of breastfeeding on heart disease and other specific cardiovascular risk factors,\" said Lisette T. Jacobson, Ph.D., M.P.A., M.A., lead author of the study and assistant professor in the department of preventive medicine and public health at the University of Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita.\n\nThis is among the first studies to examine breastfeeding and a possible relationship to stroke risk for mothers, as well as how such a relationship might vary by ethnicity.\n\nResearchers analyzed data on 80,191 participants in the Women's Health Initiative observational study, a large ongoing national study that has tracked the medical events and health habits of postmenopausal women who were recruited between 1993 and 1998. All women in this analysis had delivered one or more children and 58 percent reported ever having breastfed. Among these women, 51 percent breastfed for one-six months, 22 percent for seven-12 months and 27 percent for 13 or more months. At the time of recruitment, the average age was 63.7 years and the follow-up period was 12.6 years.\n\nAfter adjusting for non-modifiable stroke risk factors (such as age and family history), researchers found stroke risk among women who breastfed their babies was on average:\n\u2022 19 percent lower in women who had breastfed for up to six months. A longer reported length of breastfeeding was associated with a greater reduction in risk.\n\n\"If you are pregnant, please consider breastfeeding as part of your birthing plan and continue to breastfeed for at least six months to receive the optimal benefits for you and your infant,\" Jacobson said.\n\n\"Our study did not address whether racial/ethnic differences in breastfeeding contribute to disparities in stroke risk. Additional research should consider the degree to which breastfeeding might alter racial/ethnic differences in stroke risk,\" Jacobson said.\n\nBecause the study was observational, it couldn't establish a cause-and-effect relationship between breastfeeding and lower stroke risk, meaning that it is possible some other characteristic that distinguishes between women who breastfeed and those who don't is the factor changing the stroke risk. However, because the Women's Health Initiative is large, researchers were able to adjust for many characteristics, and the effects of breastfeeding remained strong, Jacobson said.\n\n\"Breastfeeding is only one of many factors that could potentially protect against stroke. Others include getting adequate exercise, choosing healthy foods, not smoking and seeking treatment if needed to keep your blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar in the normal range,\" Jacobson said.\n\nThe study was also limited by the relatively small number of strokes that occurred during the follow-up period (just 3.4 percent of the women experienced a stroke during the study period and 1.6 percent reported having had a stroke prior to the study) and by the Women's Health Initiative's exclusion of women who had already had severe strokes at the time of recruitment.\n\nCurrently, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend exclusive breastfeeding for six months, with continuation of breast feeding for one year or longer. For babies health, the American Heart Association recommends breastfeeding for 12 months with transition to other additional sources of nutrients beginning at about four - six months of age to ensure sufficient micronutrients in the diet.\n\nFrontiers: The Heartland Institute for Clinical and Translational Research and the Wichita Center for Graduate Medical Education-Kansas Bioscience Authority funded the study.

Nabel, director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, which is sponsoring the study.\n\nAlthough the reason for the increased risk remains a mystery, Nabel and other experts stressed that the benefits of blood sugar control have been well established for diabetics and said patients should not make any changes in their care without consulting their doctors.\n\nBut the findings cast doubt on a major hope about diabetes treatment -- that pushing levels below current targets would be beneficial -- and would force experts to rethink how to treat one of the nation's leading health problems.\n\n\"It's profoundly disappointing,\" said Richard Kahn, chief scientific and medical officer for the American Diabetes Association. \"This presents a real dilemma to patients and their physicians.

We have to really ask the question: 'How low do you go?' \"\n\nAn estimated 21 million Americans suffer from Type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the disease, and the number has been increasing because of the obesity epidemic. Diabetes patients' blood sugar levels become abnormally high, causing a host of serious complications including nerve damage, the need for amputations, blindness, and increased risk of heart attacks and strokes.\n\nMany earlier studies had shown that tightly controlling blood sugar significantly reduced the risk of many complications. The new study -- known as the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes, or Accord, trial -- was designed to convincingly test whether various aggressive treatment strategies reduced the risk of heart disease -- the main cause of death among diabetics.\n\nThe study involves 10,251 patients ages 40 to 82 at 77 sites in the United States and Canada at high risk for heart disease for any reason, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol or obesity. About half were placed on a regimen combining diet and exercise with commonly used drugs designed to lower their blood sugar levels to those of the average person with diabetes, while the other half were put on a more intensive regimen designed to drive levels closer to those of someone without diabetes. The patients were further divided into those who also received blood-pressure-lowering medication or drugs to improve their cholesterol levels.\n\nOver about four years, about half of the patients getting intensive treatment achieved blood sugar levels close to normal, and about half the patients in the standard treatment group achieved levels close to the average diabetic.\n\nBut a special 10 member panel that was monitoring the study alerted the organizers that 257 patients r eceiving intensive treatment had died, compared with 203 receiving standard treatment, a difference of 54 deaths -- or 3 per 1,000 participants per year, officials said. About half the excess deaths were from heart disease.\n\n\"We obviously were surprised,\" Nabel said. \"We were hoping for a positive outcome.\"\n\nLetters were mailed to all participants Monday notifying them of the results so they could consult with their doctors about switching to the less intensive therapy.\n\nNabel stressed that while the death rate was higher in the intensive group, the rate in both groups was still lower than would be expected in patients at high risk receiving standard treatment.\n\n\"Although there appear to be some benefit of an overall lower death rate in both groups, the [special panel] recommended stopping the trial,\" Nabel said. \"The harm of the very intensive treatment outweighed the potential benefit.\"\n\nThe researchers stressed that the findings would not alter current guidelines or treatment for most diabetics, many of whom can control their blood sugar without drugs.\n\n\"Few patients with high cardiovascular risk like those studied in Accord are treated to blood sugar levels as low as those tested in this study,\" said Judith Fradkin of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.\n\nDriving blood sugar levels very low might still prove beneficial for other patients, such as those who are younger, were diagnosed more recently or are not at high risk for heart disease.\n\n\"It is not yet known whether controlling glucose to near normal levels will prevent heart disease and extend life in other groups,\" Fradkin said.\n\nOfficials defended the study, saying previous research had suggested that intensive blood sugar lowering would be beneficial.\n\n\"Accord is an important study intended to find new answers to help people with Type 2 diabetes reduce their high risk of heart disease,\" said Denise G. Simons Morton, the project's director.\n\nDespite an intensive analysis, researchers were unable to determine the cause of the excess deaths. Because some of the patients were taking the drug Avandia, which has been the focus of concern that it might increase the risk of heart attacks, the researchers specifically examined whether that was a factor. They determined that it was not.\n\n\"We found no link,\" said William T.

As part of the survey, female participants had blood testing for iron deficiency as well as hemoglobin testing to identify anemia.\n\nWomen are typically tested some time in their teens for anemia -- the severe form of iron deficiency -- using a quick and affordable hemoglobin test. However, iron deficiency can develop years before anemia and can be missed by hemoglobin testing alone.\n\n\"If you think about your car, you have to run your gas tank all the way down before the red light goes on, and that's similar to the way we're screening for iron deficiency,\" said Deepa L. Sekhar, physician and associate professor of pediatrics. \"We're basically waiting until their red light goes on. You have to be really low on your iron storage before you're going to flag as anemic.\"\n\nIron deficiency without anemia has been associated with lower standardized math scores, attention deficit disorder and restless leg syndrome in children and adolescents. Among iron-deficient adolescent women there is a future risk of maternal iron deficiency and negative effects on infant health.\n\nBlood tests for iron deficiency without anemia have been developed but they are more costly and difficult to obtain in the doctor's office compared to hemoglobin testing for anemia. Sekhar and colleagues hoped to determine risk factors for iron deficiency without anemia that could pinpoint which women could benefit most from this more costly testing.\n\nIn the first study, when the researchers analyzed the NHANES study data, 9 percent of females who were 12 to 21 years old had iron deficiency without anemia. The researchers then looked at potential iron deficiency risk factors in this group, including the age when they started menstruating, as well as their race and ethnicity, poverty status, food insecurity, tobacco or nicotine use, dietary information, body mass index (BMI) and physical activity.\n\nAll of these factors have been associated with iron deficiency anemia in women in prior studies. However, the only risk factor significantly associated with iron deficiency without anemia in young women in this study was having had a period for more than three years. The research was recently published in the journal PLOS ONE.\n\nIn a second study, the researchers next looked at whether a specially developed questionnaire could better predict iron status. Questions were included on depression, poor attention and daytime sleepiness, symptoms which all have been associated with iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia, but were not captured in the prior NHANES analyses. This questionnaire was compared to the currently recommended four iron deficiency anemia-risk questions in the Bright Futures Adolescent Previsit Questionnaire, a survey recommended for physician use by the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nNinety-six female adolescents participated in this study, published in The Journal of Pediatrics. The Bright Futures questions alone did not predict iron deficiency or anemia. Yet, the researchers' risk assessment questionnaire was equally poor.\n\nTaken together, the studies suggest that risk factors and assessments should not be used to determine which young women should receive testing for iron deficiency.\n\n\"The questions aren't predictive,\" Sekhar said. \"I think we need to establish the optimal timing for an objective assessment of adolescent iron deficiency and anemia.\"\n\nSekhar believes the appropriate age may be 16 years old, when most females will have been menstruating for at least three years.\n\nIn addition to timing, further research will be needed to determine which blood test for iron deficiency without anemia is accurate, cost-efficient and practical for routine doctor's office use. This test should be given with hemoglobin testing to catch all young women on the spectrum of iron deficiency, Sekhar said.\n\nIron deficiency can be corrected with dietary changes and supplementation, Sekhar added.\n\nOther researchers on the study in PLOS ONE were Laura E.

The Dundee University-based team say they have used an ultrasound process called shear wave elastography (SWE) to detect prostate tumours. The method is non-invasive and cheaper than current detection techniques.\n\nProstate cancer has become the most common cancer in men in the UK. One in eight men will develop the condition at some point in their lives with more than 47,000 new cases being diagnosed every year. Men aged 50 or over, men with a family history of prostate cancer, and black men are at greatest risk of developing the condition.\n\n\u201cCurrent diagnosis of prostate cancer is extremely inefficient, leading to unnecessary treatments for many patients,\u201d said the Dundee University team\u2019s leader, Professor Ghulam Nabi. \u201cOur new method is far more accurate and also allows us to identify the difference between cancerous and benign tissue in the prostate without the need for invasive surgery.\u201d\n\nThe prostate is a small gland in the male reproductive system and is normally about the shape and size of a walnut. Current methods for determining if a prostate has become cancerous include a physical examination of the prostate (known as a digital rectal examination or DRE), MRI scans, a biopsy or tests to determine levels of the chemical prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the blood.\n\nEach carries problems. PSA results can be unreliable; a DRE is not good at identifying which cancers are benign and which need treatment; MRI scans cannot always give a definitive answer; while a biopsy carries a risk of infection and is expensive.\n\nThe new method aims to get round the problems by targeting the prostate with ultrasound. Cancerous tissue is stiffer than normal tissue so shear waves are slowed as they pass through a tumour.\n\n\u201cWe have been able to show a stark difference in results between our technology and existing techniques such as MRI,\u201d added Nabi. \u201cThe technique has picked up cancers which MRI did not reveal. We can now see with much greater accuracy what tissue is cancerous, where it is and what level of treatment it needs. This is a significant step forward.\u201d\n\nThe trial tests involved around 200 patients. \u201cNow we need to use this on a wider scale to build more data but there is clearly the potential to really change the way we manage prostate cancer,\u201d Nabi said.\n\nSWE technology is already used in diagnosing breast cancer and liver diseases. However, to make it applicable to prostate cancer a special probe had to be developed by the team.\n\n\u201cThe technique now needs to be tested in a much larger number of men to confirm just how well it can detect the aggressive cancers, while also ruling out those who do not have prostate cancer,\u201d said Simon Grieveson, head of research funding at Prostate Cancer UK, which funded the Dundee project (with support from the Movember Foundation).\n\n\u201cWith an average of one man dying every 45 minutes from prostate cancer in the UK, the need for a more reliable test that can identify dangerous forms of the disease earlier is greater than ever.\u201d\n\nIn the past few years, a number of celebrities have revealed that they had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and have joined campaigns to raise awareness of the disease, including Michael Parkinson, Ian McKellen and most recently Stephen Fry, the comedian and former rector of Dundee University, who this year described how he had surgery to deal with a prostate tumour.\n\n\u201cThis breakthrough comes at a time when prostate cancer is being pushed to the forefront of our consciousness in the UK, not least because of the disturbing upward trend in its prevalence,\u201d said Fry. \u201cIt is therefore doubly exciting to hear of the new techniques in diagnostic imaging.\n\nNumber of cases of prostate cancer diagnosed every year in the UK\n\nThe number of men who die each year from the disease\n\nProportion of UK men who will get prostate cancer in their lifetime", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "While the story doesn\u2019t explicitly deal with the availability of shear wave elastography (SWE), it\u2019s fairly clear that the new approach is experimental, has only been used on no more than 200 patients, and would require larger clinical trials to prove its efficacy \u2014 all points that suggest that it may not be available to most patients now.\u00a0 It also states that, \u201cSWE technology is already used in diagnosing breast cancer and liver diseases.\u201d", "answer": 1}, {"article": "(Reuters Health) - Women who take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to ease menopause symptoms like hot flashes and night sweats may be no more likely to die prematurely than women who don\u2019t take hormones, a new study suggests.\n\nMany women have been reluctant to use hormones for menopause symptoms since 2002, when the federally funded Women\u2019s Health Initiative (WHI) study linked the treatments containing man-made versions of the female hormones estrogen and progestin to an increased risk of breast cancer, heart attacks and strokes.\n\nThe current study, however, looked at longer-term data from the WHI study and found no increased risk of death from all causes, or from cancer or cardiovascular issues in particular, associated with hormone use.\n\n\u201cWomen seeking treatment for distressing hot flashes, night sweats or other menopausal symptoms may find the mortality results reassuring,\u201d said lead study author Dr. JoAnn Manson of Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston.\n\nWomen go through menopause when they stop menstruating, typically between ages 45 and 55. As the ovaries curb production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone in the years leading up to menopause and afterward, women can experience symptoms ranging from irregular periods and vaginal dryness to mood swings and insomnia.\n\nFor the study, researchers looked at data on 27,347 women ages 50 to 79 who joined two WHI trials between 1993 and 1998 and were followed through 2014. One trial tested estrogen alone against a placebo, or dummy pill, while the other trial tested estrogen taken in combination with progestin.\n\nWomen were 63 years old on average when they joined the trials and had already gone through menopause. They took hormones or a placebo for five to seven years and were followed for a total of 18 years altogether.\n\nDeath rates were similar - at about 27 percent - among women who took hormones and women who didn\u2019t, researchers report in JAMA.\n\nYounger women in the study appeared to have better survival odds with HRT. Over the initial five to seven years when women were randomly assigned to take hormones or a placebo, death rates were about 30 percent lower among women aged 50 to 59 when they took HRT than when they didn\u2019t.\n\nFor women who started hormones in their 60s or 70s, however, there wasn\u2019t a meaningful difference in death rates according to whether they got the treatment or a placebo during the initial years of the study.\n\nAfter 18 years, including both the treatment period and a decade or more of follow-up, women\u2019s age when they joined the study no longer appeared to significantly influence death rates.\n\nOne limitation of the study is that the WHI didn\u2019t look at different dosages of hormone pills, and the findings may be different for other dosages or different types of therapy such as gels or creams or skin patches.\n\nStill, the current study should ease concerns raised by earlier results from the WHI trials that an increased risk of breast cancer or heart attacks might translate into higher long-term mortality rates, said Dr. Melissa McNeil, author of an accompanying editorial and a women\u2019s health researcher at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nTaking a combination of estrogen and progestin is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, but advances in screening and treatment since the WHI started now mean these tumors are unlikely to be fatal, McNeil said by email.\n\nWith additional years of follow-up, it also appears that the increased heart attack risk associated with HRT in the initial results from the WHI trials is limited to older women, McNeil added.\n\n\u201cHormone therapy has been in and out of favor - first it was good for all menopausal women, then it was dangerous for all women,\u201d McNeil said. \u201cThe take-home message now is that for the right patient, hormone therapy is safe and effective.\u201d", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "These therapies are widely available and that\u2019s implied in the story.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Philadelphia, PA, June 2, 2016 - Basal cell carcinoma is one of the most common cancers and its incidence is increasing worldwide, putting a significant burden on health services. Topical treatments are available for superficial basal cell carcinoma (BCC) but there has a lack of long-term follow-up data to guide treatment decisions. A three-year randomized controlled clinical trial has found that two topical creams are effective in most primary, low-risk superficial BCC, comparing favorably with photodynamic therapy (PDT), as reported by investigators in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology.\n\nMore than 80% of all skin cancers are BCC, arising from the basal cells (i.e., small, round cells found in the lower layer of the epidermis). There are over two million cases a year in the U.S. and the lifetime risk of developing a BCC before the age of 85 years is one in five people. The prognosis is excellent, but it can cause significant disfigurement by invading surrounding tissues.\n\nWhile most types of BCC require surgery, superficial BCC can be treated topically with noninvasive treatments such as PDT, imiquimod cream, fluorouracil cream, cryosurgery or electrodessication and curettage.\n\nInvestigators in the Netherlands report the results of a three-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial that compared three noninvasive treatments that included imiquimod and fluorouracil cream. \"The main advantages of noninvasive treatments are good cosmetic outcome, preservation of surrounding tissue, and potential for home application of either creams,\" explained lead investigator Marieke Roozeboom of the Department of Dermatology, Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands. \"Throughout the last two decades there has been a growing interest in these non-surgical therapies, which offer the possibility of avoiding surgery and reducing demands on busy medical practices.\"\n\nHowever, prior to this study there has been a lack of randomized controlled trials with a long-term follow-up that compare the effectiveness of noninvasive treatments. Consequently, there is no consensus in international BCC guidelines on the first choice of noninvasive therapy for superficial BCC.\n\nA total of 601 patients with a superficial BCC participated in this study: 202 patients were treated with methylaminolevulinate photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT), 198 with imiquimod cream, and 201 with fluorouracil cream. The three study groups had a similar distribution of baseline characteristics, with the exception of tumor size.\n\nAround 80% of patients with superficial BCC were tumor free after imiquimod treatment after three years. The clearance rate was 68% for patients treated with fluorouracil and 58% for individuals receiving PDT.\n\n\"Based on our findings, both imiquimod and fluorouracil are effective noninvasive treatments in most primary, low-risk superficial BCC, but the data provide no definite evidence for superiority of imiquimod to fluorouracil,\" commented Dr. Roozeboom. \"Both creams have an equal cosmetic outcome and risk of local adverse events. Fluorouracil has the advantage of being less expensive than imiquimod. However, between one- and three-year follow-up, more recurrences were diagnosed in the fluorouracil group compared with the imiquimod group.\"\n\n\"When choosing a treatment for an individual patient with a superficial BCC, other factors like age, compliance, and patient preferences should always be taken into account. For example, we have found that in superficial BCC on the lower extremities in older patients, PDT should be prescribed rather than imiquimod. Our evidence indicates that a personalized treatment approach is necessary,\" added Dr. Roozeboom.\n\n\"Three year follow-up results of photodynamic therapy versus imiquimod versus fluorouracil for treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma: a single blind, noninferiority, randomized controlled trial,\" by Marieke H.

Among the most dispensed: eat a healthy diet, keep a healthy weight, avoid alcohol and tobacco and stay away from certain medications, such as blood pressure and depression drugs.\n\nNow, researchers publishing in the journal have found that another lifestyle change\u2014exercise\u2014may also help improve sperm quality.\n\nIn the study, Behzad Maleki at Justus-Liebig University in Germany and his colleagues recruited 280 sedentary, middle-aged men and randomly assigned them to one of three exercise regimens, or to no exercise, and followed them for six months. They wanted to see what effect different types of exercise, and different intensity activity, had on sperm quality and count. One group exercised at moderate levels continuously by walking or jogging on a treadmill, while another followed the same protocol but at a higher intensity. Another group did high intensity exercise on the treadmill but in short interval bouts.\n\nCompared to the control group that didn\u2019t exercise, all of the men who followed a physical activity program showed improvements in a variety of measures of their sperm. After six months, they showed less DNA damage, healthier sperm shape and lower levels of metabolic stress factors. They also showed higher numbers of sperm precursors.\n\n\u201cThis fits reasonably well with what we thought about the effects of exercise,\u201d says Dr. Peter Schlegel, vice president of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine and chairman of urology at New York Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. \u201cBut this is a much better done study than almost anything that\u2019s been done before on the subject.\u201d He notes that most previous studies did not randomly assign people to exercise groups and compare the outcome on sperm quality, but rather recorded sperm measures among men who reported their exercise habits after the fact.\n\nIn the current study, the men in the moderate intensity, continuous activity program showed the most improvements compared to men in the other two more intense groups. While it\u2019s not entirely clear why, part of the reason may have to do with the fact that extreme exercise generates body heat, which can be detrimental to sperm health; for marathoners and people training at intense levels, finding ways to dissipate body heat is a major concern. Schlegel also says that regular exercise can improve circulation and make the blood vessels healthier, which may benefit the testes, an organ that\u2019s sensitive to and requires good blood flow.\n\nExercise may also be working in other ways to enhance reproductive health, since all of the men who exercised lost weight, reduced their amount of body fat and improved their fitness levels. Fat tissue has been linked to higher levels of damaging metabolic stress compounds, so losing weight and becoming more fit may create more hospitable conditions for sperm and improve its quality and volume.\n\nThere are already plenty of reasons to exercise, and now better quality sperm is one more worth noting.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Exercise \u2014 in this case, running \u2014 is clearly a readily available activity for most individuals.\u00a0 They simply have to decide to do it.

That includes more than three million Americans, only half of whom are aware they have the disease, according to the Glaucoma Research Foundation.\n\nCoffee, or caffeine in general have previously been linked to increased glaucoma risk, although recent studies don\u2019t agree, Coleman and her colleagues write.\n\nTo evaluate the relationship between specific caffeinated drinks and glaucoma, Coleman and colleagues analyzed data on a sample of more than 10,000 people in the U.S. who were representative of the entire population. Participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey during 2005-2006 answered questions about their diets and lifestyles, had medical exams and blood tests and also underwent eye examinations.\n\nAbout 1,700 participants were over age 40, had no other known eye diseases and had full eye examination results from the survey. In this group, Coleman\u2019s team found that just over 5 percent, 82 people, had glaucoma.\n\nAlmost half of participants reported drinking coffee often, but less than 10 percent drank hot tea daily. The research team found no associations between coffee, iced tea, decaffeinated tea or soft drink consumption and the likelihood of having glaucoma.\n\n\u201cTea drinkers should keep drinking and don\u2019t need to stop because of a fear of glaucoma,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cThis makes sense, but we\u2019ll see if it holds up in future studies.\u201d\n\nFuture studies should look at the habits, activities and nutrition that affect lifestyle and glaucoma risks, said Idan Hecht of Tel-Aviv University in Israel, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research.\n\n\u201cIn the past few years, there has been a tremendous increase in interest, and subsequently research, into the ways lifestyle changes can influence diseases,\u201d Hecht told Reuters Health by email.\n\nRecent research indicates that vitamins C, E and zinc can help vision. Other studies indicate that antioxidants in tea could have similar effects, he noted.\n\n\u201cPatients can and should be involved and take an active role in the management of their ailments,\u201d Hecht said. \u201cExercising, eating healthy and trying novel ways to improve your health is something you should definitely explore and bring up with your physician.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental factors could play a role in glaucoma risk as well, said Dr. Ahmad Aref at the University of Illinois at Chicago.\n\n\u201cAs our population grows older, we need to think about the other factors that could help, particularly when it comes to the health benefits of physical activity,\u201d he told Reuters Health by phone.\n\nOverall, both medical and non-medical approaches are key to treating the disease in the future, Aref added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough disease because we don\u2019t have a way to bring vision back once it\u2019s lost,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we can do is prevent it from getting worse, and we want to help patients do that.\u201d", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Other than water, tea is the most widely consumed beverage in the world.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "A next-generation visor from eSight can improve vision for many legally blind people.

And they're doing this even though ketamine lacks approval from the Food and Drug Administration for treating depression.\n\n\"It became clear to me that the future of psychiatry was going to include ketamine or derivatives of ketamine,\" says David Feifel, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego, who began administering the drug to patients in 2010.\n\nKetamine was developed as an anesthetic and received FDA approval for this use in 1970. Decades later, it became popular as a psychedelic club drug. And in 2006, a team from the National Institute of Mental Health published a landmark study showing that a single intravenous dose of ketamine produced \"robust and rapid antidepressant effects\" within a couple of hours.\n\nSince then, thousands of depressed patients have received \"off-label\" treatment with ketamine.\n\nOne of those patients is Paul, 36, who lives in San Diego and is a patient of Dr. Feifel. We're not using his last name to protect his medical privacy.\n\nPaul's depression began with anxiety. \"I was an extremely anxious child,\" he says. \"I would always make choices based on fear. My life was really directed by what was the least fearful thing that I could do.\"\n\nAs Paul grew up, his extreme anxiety led to major depression, which could leave him unable to get out of bed for days. \"I lived in pain,\" he says.\n\nPaul managed to get through college and a stint in the Peace Corps. But most days were a struggle. And Paul has spent much of his adult life searching for a treatment that would give him some relief.\n\nHe tried just about every drug used for depression, as well as cognitive behavioral therapy, acupuncture, and even electroconvulsive therapy, which induces a brief seizure. But nothing worked \u2014 at least not for very long.\n\nPaul says he was increasingly haunted by \"this comforting thought of pressing a cold gun against my forehead where I felt the pain the most.\"\n\nThen one day, while investigating depression on the Internet, Paul discovered the research on ketamine. \"It was clear to me that this was real,\" he says.\n\nOrdinarily, there would have been no legal way for Paul to get ketamine. He didn't qualify for most research studies because of his suicidal thoughts. And doctors usually won't prescribe a mind-altering club drug to someone with a mental illness.\n\nBut the studies of ketamine have produced results so dramatic that some doctors, including Feifel, are bypassing the usual protocols.\n\nBy the time Feifel began hearing about ketamine, he had become frustrated with existing depression drugs. Too often, he says, they just weren't helping his patients.\n\nA major study on antidepressant medication published in 2008 seemed to confirm his suspicions. It found that current antidepressants really aren't much better than a placebo.\n\nMany psychiatrists criticized that study. But not Feifel. \"I was kind of like, I'm not surprised,\" he says. \"These really don't seem like powerful tools.\"\n\nFeifel remembers feeling \"professionally embarrassed\" that psychiatrists didn't have something better to offer their depressed patients. Something like ketamine.\n\nHe knew the drug had risks. It could be abused. It could produce hallucinations. And it didn't have the FDA's OK for treating depression.\n\nBut he also knew that doctors had a lot of experience with ketamine. It's been used for decades as an anesthetic that can rapidly stop pain without affecting vital functions like breathing. And ketamine's safety record is so good that it's often the painkiller of choice for children who arrive in the emergency room with a broken bone.\n\nSo in 2010, Feifel decided he wanted to offer low doses of the drug to some patients. The decision put him at odds with some prominent psychiatrists, including Tom Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health. \"While the science is promising, ketamine is not ready for broad use in the clinic,\" Insel wrote in his blog a few months ago.\n\n\"There are a lot of pundits who remain skeptical or feel we need to research this ad infinitum before it's ready, which doesn't make sense to me,\" Feifel says. It's hard to take the wait-and-see approach when you're treating patients who are desperate for help, he adds.\n\nPaul was one of those desperate patients when he was referred to Feifel in March of 2014. The referral was from a local psychiatrist who had run out of ideas, Feifel says.\n\nAnd Paul jumped at the chance to try ketamine. \"If there was even a 1 percent chance that this worked, it would have been worth it to me,\" he says. \"My life was hanging in the balance.\"\n\nAnd for Paul, the benefits of ketamine became obvious soon after one of his early injections.\n\n\"I remember I was in my bathroom and I literally fell to my knees crying because I had no anxiety, I had no depression,\" he says\n\nFor the past year, Paul has been getting ketamine every four to six weeks. He feels an altered sense of reality for an hour or two after getting the drug. The effect on depression and anxiety, though, lasts more than a month.\n\nKetamine doesn't always work that well, Feifel says. After treating more than 100 patients, he's beginning to understand the drug's limitations.\n\nOne is that its ability to keep depression at bay can fade pretty quickly. Feifel recalls one patient whose depression would disappear like magic after a dose of ketamine. But \"we could never get it to sustain beyond maybe a day,\" he says.\n\nAlso, ketamine treatment is expensive because patients need to be monitored so closely. Feifel charges about $500 for each injection and $1,000 for an intravenous infusion, which takes effect more quickly. Insurers don't cover the cost because the treatment is still considered experimental.\n\nEven so, ketamine clinics are popping up around the country and they have already treated thousands of patients willing and able to pay out of pocket. Some of the clinics are run by psychiatrists. Others have been started by entrepreneurial anesthesiologists and emergency room doctors, who are familiar with ketamine but may not know much about depression.\n\n\"We've seen ketamine clinics open up as pure business models,\" Feifel says. \"I'm a little bit concerned about that.\"\n\nFeifel fears something bad will happen to a depressed patient at one of these clinics. And that could set back efforts to make the drug more widely available.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story reports that ketamine is not approved for treatment of depression, but it is widely used as an anesthetic.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Twelve years ago, a car wreck took away Nathan Copeland's ability to control his hands or sense what his fingers were touching.\n\nA few months ago, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center gave Copeland a new way to reach out and feel the world around him. It's a mind-controlled robotic arm that has pressure sensors in each fingertip that send signals directly to Copeland's brain.\n\nThe scientists published details of their work online Thursday in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\n\"It's a really weird sensation,\" Copeland, now 30, says in a video made shortly after he first tried the system. \"Sometimes it feels, kind of, like electrical and sometimes it's more of a pressure.\" But he also describes many of the sensations coming from his robotic hand as \"natural.\"\n\nWhen Copeland touches an object with the robotic hand, he can tell which finger the sensation is coming from and whether an object feels hard or soft, says Robert Gaunt, a bioengineer and assistant professor in the Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\n\"But we're really not at the point where we could, say, get him to feel the difference between silk and burlap,\" Gaunt says.\n\nThe success represents an advance that is \"absolutely critical in terms of making prosthetics useful,\" says Mike McLoughlin, an engineer at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.\n\nMcLoughlin is part of a team at Hopkins that developed the Modular Prosthetic Limb that Copeland is using. The research at both Hopkins and in Pittsburgh is supported by the government's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.\n\nFor several years now, people have been able to control robotic arms using thoughts alone. But they have relied entirely on vision to know whether the arm is going in the right direction or grasping an object with the proper amount of force.\n\nThat makes it very challenging to perform simple tasks like grasping a foam coffee cup without crushing it, McLoughlin says.\n\n\"Without sensory feedback, somebody would have to actually have to look at the prosthetic, look at the cup, start to close the hand, (and) visually see the cup is starting to deform,\" he says.\n\nRestoring Copeland's sense of touch was a painstaking process, but the Pittsburgh team knew it was possible.\n\n\"His hand has been disconnected from his brain because of his spinal cord injury,\" Gaunt says. \"But the brain hasn't lost its ability to feel.\"\n\nSo the team began looking for a way to send touch sensations directly to Copeland's brain. The first step was to monitor his brain activity using a technique called magnetoencephalography.\n\n\"We were able to see the parts of his brain that became active when he was watching videos of a hand being touched,\" Gaunt says.\n\nNext, the researchers placed tiny electrodes in Copeland's brain that could stimulate the areas corresponding to each finger. Then they waited for the brain to heal, as it adjusted to the presence of the electrodes.\n\nIt was several weeks before the team was able to send the first tiny pulse of electricity to Copeland's brain. \"When it finally happened, he just very calmly said, 'Yep, I felt it on my index finger,' \" Gaunt recalls. \"But in the background I was breathing a sigh of relief and other people were cheering.\"\n\nOf course, mind-controlled robots are still years away from consumer applications, McLoughlin says. At the moment, they are still too expensive, too bulky and too finicky to be used outside a laboratory setting. And there's no good way to control them without implanting electrodes in the brain.\n\nStill, the ability to receive touch sensation from a robotic arm has the potential to help not only thousands of people who are paralyzed, but also people with a wide range of physical disabilities, McLoughlin says. For example, robots that provide sensory feedback could eventually help a disabled person cook a meal or clean up things at home.\n\n\"We're on the verge of something here that's going to transform lives,\" he says.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story makes clear this patient is the first to receive this treatment in an experimental setting, so it is clear that this is not available except in a laboratory.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Testing women for human papillomavirus (HPV) may catch more pre-cancerous growths than standard cervical cancer screening does \u2014 but more evidence is needed before the newer tests become routine, a study published Monday concludes.\n\nThe report, in the Annals of Internal Medicine, sums up a research review done for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), an expert medical panel supported by the federal government.\n\nThe USPSTF is set to update its recommendations on cervical cancer screening, which were last laid out in 2003.\n\nAt that time, the task force recommended that sexually active women get regular Pap tests to screen for cervical cancer. But it said there was not enough evidence to recommend for or against newer types of testing \u2014 including HPV tests and the \u201cliquid-based\u201d Pap tests that are now more often used than the old-fashioned version.\n\nDuring Pap tests, cells are swabbed or scraped from the cervix for examination under a microscope to find cancer or possible pre-cancerous changes.

Whitlock, a senior investigator with Kaiser Permanente Northwest in Portland, Oregon, who led the review.\n\nBut there are still questions about the effects of HPV screening, and \u201cmore complete evidence\u201d is needed before it becomes widely used, Whitlock and her colleagues write.\n\nHPV is a common virus that causes warts, including genital warts. Usually, the immune system clears the infection, but persistent infection with certain strains of HPV leads to cervical cancer in some women.\n\nSo in recent years, tests for those \u201chigh-risk\u201d HPV strains have been developed to help in screening for the disease. A few HPV tests are approved for use, along with Pap tests, for screening women age 30 or older. (The tests are not approved for younger women because they give doctors little information; younger women commonly have HPV infections that go away on their own.)\n\nIt has not been clear exactly how HPV testing, or liquid-based Pap tests, measure up against standard Pap tests.\n\nIn their review, Whitlock\u2019s team examined four clinical trials including more than 140,000 women that compared older Pap tests with the liquid-based version.\n\nThey found that both tests had nearly the same \u201csensitivity\u201d \u2014 which refers to their ability to detect cancer or pre-cancer. The tests also had the same \u201cspecificity,\u201d which can be used to measure how often a screening test produces false-positive results.\n\nAcross studies, the false-positive rate ranged between about six percent and 16 percent for both conventional and liquid-based Pap tests.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s reassuring to know that they perform equivalently,\u201d Whitlock told Reuters Health.\n\nIn an interview, she noted that the decision of whether to do a conventional or liquid-based Pap test is not the patient\u2019s. It may not even be the doctor\u2019s \u2014 but may instead depend on whatever health system he or she is part of.\n\nSeveral other clinical trials in the review looked at HPV testing. In general, Whitlock\u2019s team found, HPV tests were more sensitive than conventional Pap tests, but they were less specific, meaning they had a higher false-positive rate.\n\nIn a 2003 trial of more than 3,000 women, for example, HPV testing caught 96 percent of potentially pre-cancerous growths, versus 65 percent with Pap tests. But the false-positive rate was 15 percent, compared with two percent with Pap testing.\n\nThe problem with that higher false-positive rate is that it could lead to needless biopsies and other tests, or treatment to remove abnormal-looking tissue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tricky thing to get your mind around,\u201d Whitlock said. \u201cIt may seem that if a test is more sensitive, it must be better. But it\u2019s more subtle than that. You\u2019re trying to make a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity.\u201d\n\nSince cervical cancer screening is repeated over time, what\u2019s needed is evidence of the longer-term effects of different tests, according to Whitlock. How often, for example, does HPV testing lead to biopsies, versus Pap testing?\n\nAnd no one knows yet whether HPV testing actually catches cervical cancer at an earlier stage, or reduces deaths from the disease, compared with Pap tests.\n\nClinical trials are ongoing, Whitlock said. \u201cThe state of the science will be changing relatively quickly, so we\u2019ll have to keep looking at this.\u201d\n\nRight now, the American Cancer Society (ACS) and other medical groups recommend that women start Pap tests at age 21 or three years after they become sexually active, whichever comes first. Those should be done every one to two years until age 30; after age 30, women who\u2019ve had three normal Pap tests in a row can be screened less often \u2014 every two to three years.\n\nPap plus HPV testing, done every three years, is considered a \u201creasonable option\u201d for women age 30 and up, according to the ACS.\n\nNationally, the cervical cancer death rate dropped by 70 percent between 1955 and 1992, and routine Pap testing is credited for most of that decline.\n\nBut many women still do not get regular Pap screening, Whitlock pointed out. It\u2019s thought that more than half of cervical cancer cases in the U.S. occur in women who\u2019ve never been screened, or haven\u2019t been in the past five years.\n\nIf more women received the screening that already exists, \u201cthat would be a huge step forward,\u201d Whitlock said.\n\nAn estimated 12,700 U.S. women will be diagnosed with cervical cancer this year, and nearly 4,300 will die from the disease, according to the ACS.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The different testing methods are all widely available and that can be inferred from the story.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "When 57-year-old Dean Cowles suddenly suffered a heart attack, he was lucky that he worked at a company that made defibrillators,reports.\n\n\"Once we started CPR, Steve hooked one of the paddles and I hooked the other,\" says co-worker Oscar Rojas. \"He started rendering the compression and I started mouth to mouth.\"\n\nIt's a story that still gives Cowles chills.\n\n\"Every time I hear this story, I get goose bumps,\" Cowles says. \"It shakes me every time I hear that story, but yes, I was dead.\"\n\nHis colleagues managed to restart his heart. But what helped save his brain \u2014 and left him remarkably undamaged \u2014 was a simple procedure in the ER: chilling his body. It's called induced hypothermia. The idea is that cooling a comatose patient after a heart attack prevents brain damage.\n\n\"Anytime you can take someone who comes into the hospital after having cardiac arrest, who may not ever wake up, and you can potentially change that to someone who can wake up and become back the person they were the day before, it's an amazing thing,\" says Dr. David Likosky, a neurologist.\n\nResearch has shown it can improve the survival rate by 14 percent.\n\n\"We know how to use it but we really don't know how it works,\" says cardiologist Mark Vossler. \"We know that people's neurologic outcomes are likely to be better if they get it but we don't completely understand what's happening in the brain for sure when the body is cooled.\"\n\nSays Likosky: \"If you cool the brain down, it may be that it uses less energy and (is) less likely to damage itself over that first 24 hours.\"\n\nIce packs can do the job, but new devices make it easier to reduce and regulate temperature. Pads are placed on the chest and legs, and cold water circulates through the pathways.\n\n\"The cooling pads are applied, and we bring their body temperature down to 91 to 93 degrees. We keep them at that temperature for the first 24 hours, at which time we re-warm them,\" Likosky explains.\n\nThe American Heart Association recommended more than a year ago using induced hypothermia for cardiac arrest patients who are stable. But most hospitals don't. It requires training and a lot of coordination.\n\n\"It should be more widely used.

The investigational prep is designed to be good-tasting, with no fasting and lower fluid requirements than standard preps. It consists of nutritionally balanced bars and beverages incorporating the standard purgative active ingredient, PEG 3350, which a patient consumes during the 24 hours prior to colonoscopy.\n\nResults from the randomized, single-blind study will be presented today at the American College of Gastroenterology 2016 Annual Scientific Meeting, being held in Las Vegas, NV, by principal investigator, Douglas K.

Older people tend to get less slow-wave sleep and are at greater risk for memory impairment.\n\nZee and her fellow researchers had 13 adults ages 60 and older spend two nights in a sleep lab. On both nights, the participants took a memory test at night, went to sleep wearing headphones and an electrode cap, and repeated the memory test in the morning.\n\nOn one of those nights, headphone-clad participants were played a series of short bursts of pink noise during deep sleep, spaced out enough to prevent the brain from getting used to and ignoring them. \u201cThe noise is fairly pleasant; it kind of resembles a rush of water,\u201d says Zee. \u201cIt\u2019s just noticeable enough that the brain realizes it\u2019s there, but not enough to disturb sleep.\u201d The sounds were timed to match their slow-wave oscillations.

(March 10, 2016) - Approximately 14 percent of men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point in their lifetimes, according to the National Institutes of Health. Radiation therapy traditionally has been a primary treatment for the cancer, but one-fourth of men have a recurrence of prostate cancer within five years after the therapy. Now, a University of Missouri School of Medicine researcher has found that a complex procedure to remove the prostate achieves excellent long-term survival for men after radiation therapy has failed.\n\n\"Prostate cancer, unfortunately, is a common cancer, and more than 27,000 men are estimated to have died from the disease in 2015,\" said Naveen Pokala, M.D., an assistant professor in the Division of Urology at the MU School of Medicine and lead author of the study. \"By studying a national database of prostate cancer cases, we found that a procedure known as salvage radical prostatectomy can greatly increase a man's chance of survival when traditional radiation therapy has failed to eradicate the cancer.\"\n\nUsing the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program database, Pokala and his research team studied 364 patients who underwent a salvage radical prostatectomy surgery after unsuccessful radiation treatments. Looking at survival rates, the researchers found that 88.6 percent of men were still alive 10 years later and 72.7 percent of men were still alive 20 years later.\n\nDuring a salvage radical prostatectomy, the prostate gland and surrounding tissue are surgically removed to keep the cancer from spreading. The procedure is challenging because tissue that surrounds the prostate is scarred during radiation treatment, making it difficult for the surgeon to identify and cut out tissue that needs to be removed. If the cancer is localized, a highly skilled surgeon can remove the gland and surrounding tissue using a robotic minimally invasive technique or through an open surgery.\n\n\"Because radical prostatectomy is a complex surgery, there can be a reluctance to undergo the procedure,\" Pokala said. \"However, this study shows that it is a viable treatment option. This can bring a renewed hope and peace of mind to men living with prostate cancer.\"\n\nThe study, \"Survival Outcomes in Men Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy after Primary Radiation Treatment for Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate,\" recently was published by Clinical Genitourinary Cancer, a peer-reviewed journal on the detection, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of genitourinary cancers.", "question": "Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Data analyzed in the release relates to surgeries performed between 1988 and 2010 at many different institutions so we assume it is widely available.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "An experimental procedure aimed at repairing spinal cord injuries is showing promise.

Dr. Nagele's work focuses on utilizing autoantibodies as blood-based biomarkers to accurately detect the presence of myriad diseases and pinpoint the stage to which a disease has progressed. By detecting Alzheimer's disease long before symptoms emerge, Dr. Nagele hopes those with disease-related autoantibody biomarkers will be encouraged to make beneficial lifestyle changes that may help to slow development of the disease.\n\n\"There are significant benefits to early disease detection because we now know that many of the same conditions that lead to vascular disease are also significant risk factors for Alzheimer's. People found to have preclinical disease can take steps to improve their vascular health, including watching their diet, exercising and managing any weight and blood pressure issues to help stave off or slow disease progression,\" Nagele said.\n\nWhile the cause of Alzheimer's remains elusive, it is clear that maintaining a healthy blood-brain barrier is a critical preventative measure. Diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, stroke and being overweight jeopardize vascular health. As blood vessels in the brain weaken or become brittle with age, they begin to leak, which allows plasma components including brain-reactive autoantibodies into the brain. There, the autoantibodies can bind to neurons and accelerate the accumulation of beta amyloid deposits, a hallmark of Alzheimer's pathology.\n\nThe blood test developed by Dr. Nagele has also shown promise in detecting other diseases, including Parkinsons's, multiple sclerosis and breast cancer. His team's research on the role of autoantibodies explains that:\n\u2022 All humans possess thousands of autoantibodies in their blood;\n\u2022 These autoantibodies specifically bind to blood-borne cellular debris generated by organs and tissues all over the body;\n\u2022 An individual's autoantibody profile is strongly influenced by age, gender and the presence of specific diseases or injuries; and\n\u2022 Diseases cause characteristic changes in autoantibody profiles that, when detected, can serve as biomarkers that reveal the presence of the disease.\n\nIn Alzheimer's, the brain begins to change years before symptoms emerge. Detecting Alzheimer's antibodies at the preclinical stage would give patients an opportunity to work with their physician to make lifestyle changes or receive available treatments before they become symptomatic. Potentially, this early intervention could help those with preclinical Alzheimer's avoid or delay the most devastating symptoms.\n\n\"As osteopathic physicians, we constantly tell patients that a healthy lifestyle is the best medicine for preventing disease. We also know that many people tune out messages about nutrition and exercise until a health crisis gets their attention,\" said Jennifer Caudle, DO, assistant professor of family medicine at Rowan University. \"I can't think of a single patient who wouldn't take steps to prevent the progression of Alzheimer's if they could directly affect their prognosis.\"\n\nToday, there is no definitive FDA-approved blood test for Alzheimer's, which affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans.

In effect, you\u2019re trading one problem (addiction) for another (undertreatment of chronic pain).\n\nA new study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, however, offers a cause for optimism: Reviewing the research so far, it found that it may be possible to reduce doses for patients in long-term opioid therapy and improve their pain outcomes. So doctors can potentially pull back the opioids that launched the current drug overdose crisis and still successfully treat pain patients.\n\nNow, by this latest study\u2019s own admission, the evidence is of generally poor quality. Most of the studies reviewed were of poor methodology or sample size, while only a few were of \u201cfair\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d quality. The review also only looked at patients who volunteered to taper off opioids, meaning this research does not prove that involuntarily pulling patients off the drugs will lead to similar outcomes.\n\nSuffice to say, then, a lot more research is necessary before this issue is settled.\n\nBut the new study does offer a glimmer of hope in a fairly grim opioid epidemic: Maybe it is possible to reduce the amount of dangerous opioids that patients are consuming and still alleviate people\u2019s pain.\n\nFor the latest review of the evidence, researchers looked at 67 studies that collectively provided data on more than 12,000 pain patients who were weaned off at least some opioids. Though the researchers found a lot of studies to pool from, they generally graded these studies as \u201cvery low\u201d in quality and methodology.\n\nResearchers then identified the studies \u2014 none of which were graded as \u201cgood\u201d quality \u2014 that evaluated pain-related outcomes for patients after long-term opioid therapy was tapered. Focusing on the \u201cfair-quality\u201d studies, they found that after opioid dose reductions, patients on average saw improved pain, function, and quality of life.\n\nThe authors provide a few possible explanations for this: Perhaps the non-opioid pain treatments, such as physical therapy and meditation, that accompanied dose reductions simply produced better results than the opioids did. Maybe the opioids themselves caused problems that negatively impacted function or quality of life, \u201csuch as constipation, fatigue, poor sleep, and depressed mood.\u201d It\u2019s possible that opioid dose reduction also resolved what\u2019s known as opioid-induced hyperalgesia, \u201ca paradoxical response in which patients receiving opioids become more sensitive to painful stimuli.\u201d\n\nOr, the researchers suggested, the observational studies simply showed reverse causation \u2014 \u201cthat is, patients successfully tapered opioids because pain severity decreased.\u201d\n\nThe findings do not mean that doctors can now simply yank patients off opioids and expect them to get better. For one, the reviewed studies generally looked at the results of tapering, when patients are slowly weaned off opioid painkillers \u2014 a process that, Stanford psychiatrist Anna Lembke told me, can take months or even years.\n\nCrucially, the studies also looked at what happened when these reductions in opioid doses were paired with alternative treatments, including alternative medicines like acupuncture, interdisciplinary pain programs, and medication-assisted treatment for addiction. This is very, very different from a situation in which a patient is taken off opioids and effectively left stranded without any other form of care.\n\nAs the researchers readily admit, the study also had several major limitations. Most of the studies analyzed were of poor quality \u2014 meaning there\u2019s a serious need for better research in this area. And the studies only evaluated voluntary reductions in opioid doses; it\u2019s entirely possible that involuntary reductions in opioid doses would lead to sharply different outcomes.\n\n\u201cWe should be cautious in interpreting the findings,\u201d Joseph Frank, lead author of the study, told me. He emphasized that more research needs to be done to fill \u201cimportant gaps\u201d in our knowledge. He added, \u201cI want patients and their doctors to use caution in applying this.\u201d\n\nA few pain patients will still benefit from opioids\n\nOne of the study\u2019s implications is that opioids actually aren\u2019t a good treatment for chronic pain. This isn\u2019t new. As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded in its 2016 summary of the research, there are simply no good long-term studies looking at the effects of opioids on long-term pain outcomes, while there are many studies showing that long-term opioid use can lead to bad results in other areas, including addiction and overdose.\n\nThat does not mean opioids are never an effective treatment for chronic pain.\n\nAs addiction and pain experts often tell me, health care can vary vastly from patient to patient. Some patients feel worse on opioids, while others report quick pain relief. Some patients experience grueling withdrawal if taken off opioids, while for others the symptoms are much less severe. Some patients are at unusually high risk for addiction, while many \u2014 most, in fact \u2014 aren\u2019t. And so on.\n\nIn a few cases, then, opioids will still be the best answer for some individual chronic pain patients. When prescribed carefully on a schedule that works to diminish the excessive buildup of tolerance, they can work for some people. But as Stanford pain specialist Sean Mackey emphasized to me, opioids should not be a first-line treatment due to the risks, and alternatives should be tried first.\n\nThis, then, is another key caveat to the study: Its findings shouldn\u2019t be applied to every patient. Like much of health care, each case will typically require individual evaluations to see what works.\n\n\u201cThere are people who do well with tapering [opioids],\u201d Stefan Kertesz, an addiction researcher at the University of Alabama Birmingham who was not involved in the study, told me. \u201cThere are people who do not do well with tapering.\u201d\n\nBut the study suggests that getting some patients off opioids could improve their pain outcomes. The key is convincing patients that this truly can work so they buy into the treatment and genuinely follow through with it \u2014 and making non-opioid treatments for pain accessible enough that patients see them as realistic options.\n\nAlternative pain treatments need to be made more accessible\n\nThe reality, though, is non-opioid pain treatments are often out of reach for many Americans. Patients may not have insurance to cover the treatment. Even if they do have insurance, their health plan might not cover comprehensive pain care. And even if they do have insurance and their health plan covers pain treatments, there may not \u2014 particularly in rural areas \u2014 be a nearby pain clinic or doctor who can actually provide the care these patients are seeking.\n\nThis is something the study\u2019s authors readily acknowledge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an important part of this challenge,\u201d Frank said. \u201cThese non-opioid strategies that were tested in these research studies are not adequately available. Several of the studies were done in pain centers where they have expert programs, and those just are not widespread.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the lack of access to non-opioid strategies may be one big reason that doctors resorted to opioids in the first place. The drugs offered an easy answer \u2014 if ultimately an ineffective one \u2014 to the many problems doctors faced, including patients who had complicated pain problems that physicians didn\u2019t fully understand and tight schedules driven by the current demands of the health care system that made it hard to take the time to work through a patient\u2019s individual problems. (More on all that in my interview with Lembke.)\n\nTo address this, Frank argued that patients need better access to pain treatments. And doctors, especially primary care doctors who are frequently the first people patients see in the health care system, also need to be better trained to deal with chronic pain.\n\nThese solutions could help a lot of people: According to one study from the Institute of Medicine, 100 million US adults suffer from chronic pain. The opioid epidemic shows that if this care isn\u2019t made available, patients may end up resorting to drugs that can literally get them killed \u2014 or, as has been reported in other tragic cases, they may kill themselves once the pain grows too bad. (The newest study, however, noted that there is no good research yet looking at these two potential outcomes if pain patients are taken off opioids.)\n\n\u201cNot only do we lack the data, but I have seen and heard of countless cases of overdose and suicide from people who have been involuntarily discontinued,\u201d Kertesz said, emphasizing this is strictly based on anecdotal observations. \u201cOne day in June, in my inbox were 42 deaths.\u201d\n\nThe findings show the balancing act of opioid policy: Even if doctors need to pull back opioids, they must be careful to ensure patients suffering from debilitating pain and other problems can still meet their other care needs.\n\nIt\u2019s not just pain care. When dealing with opioid users who are addicted, doctors and policymakers also need to ensure that addiction treatment is available. Otherwise, these patients will likely try to find another source of drugs \u2014 even if it means resorting to a riskier opioid, such as heroin or fentanyl, to satisfy their cravings.\n\nThere\u2019s good evidence this happened to many \u2014 but not all \u2014 opioid painkiller users: A 2014 study in JAMA Psychiatry found 75 percent of heroin users in treatment started with painkillers, and a 2015 analysis by the CDC found people who are addicted to painkillers are 40 times more likely to be addicted to heroin.\n\nThe fundamental problem is many of these patients don\u2019t get addiction treatment once they lose access to painkillers or before they progress to heroin or fentanyl. Without the option of treatment, opioid users\u2019 only answer to averting dependence-induced withdrawal becomes harder drugs. Yet based on a 2016 report by the surgeon general, only 10 percent of Americans with drug use disorders get specialty treatment.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that reducing prescriptions is a mistake. By stopping doctors from unscrupulously prescribing the drugs, governments can potentially stop opioids from flowing to new users who didn\u2019t really need the drugs and could have developed addictions had they been allowed to get painkillers.\n\nBut the reduction has to be paired with increased access to addiction care \u2014 and it frequently hasn\u2019t been.\n\nBeyond addiction treatment, Kertesz argued that policymakers should also address some of the underlying conditions that drive addiction. He emphasized the need for broader mental health care, given that people often have mental health issues that can make addiction more likely.\n\n\u201cWho is at higher risk \u2014 John with PTSD and a dose of 10 milligrams a day, or James, who has no PTSD and is on 200 milligrams a day?\u201d Kertesz said. Based on his reading of the data, \u201cit\u2019s John with PTSD on the 10 milligrams.\u201d\n\nBut as is true for addiction and pain treatments, adequate mental health care is also out of reach for many patients \u2014 showing just another way that the US health care system isn\u2019t built to adequately address the full needs of patients.\n\nAll of this shows why the policy solution to the opioid epidemic isn\u2019t as easy as simply pulling back prescription opioids: To avoid exacerbating existing problems or causing new ones, policymakers need to consider the other needs of people who were perhaps getting opioids they didn\u2019t really need.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story delivers: It states that tapering is available, yet that it\u2019s to be attempted with caution.

But the image that viewers may find most shocking is that of a baby being cut out of a woman's abdomen via Caesarean. This, according to Lake, the executive producer of the film, and Abby Epstein, the film's director, is the right reaction: one of their messages is that C-sections should only be performed when needed to guarantee the well-being of the mother and infant, and should not be a first choice for healthy mothers. New research into the risks associated with elective Caesareans supports their view. In a study, published in October's British Medical Journal, of 97,000 deliveries in 410 Latin American hospitals, perinatal specialist Dr. Jose Villar found the risk of death for mothers who had Caesareans, while slight (.01 percent of the women who delivered vaginally died vs. .04 percent who had elective C-sections), was triple that of those who delivered vaginally. \"The C-section increases risk because it's major surgery,\" Villar says. Mothers who had undergone a Caesarean were also more likely to need blood transfusions and stay in the hospital more than a week after delivery. The risk of death for infants delivered via C-section\u2014who are more likely to have a low birth weight\u2014was double that of vaginal births, and C-section babies were more likely to have respiratory problems. According to a study published in the journal Birth, labor clears liquid from the infant's lungs, preparing the baby to breathe outside the womb. Caesareans impede this process. Yet the rate of Caesareans is spiking: in 2006, C-sections accounted for 31.1 percent of births nationwide, a 50 percent increase over the past 10 years. Natural birth\u2014without drugs or interventions\u2014whether at home or in a hospital, remains a rarity (despite the fact that home births don't have an appreciably higher risk rate than hospital births).\n\nAmid the controversy over what constitutes an ideal birth experience, doctors, researchers and natural-birth advocates agree: Caesareans save lives when medically necessary. But defining medical necessity is complicated. Natural-birth advocates cite a \"cascade of interventions\" caused by hospitals' practice of using the drug Pitocin to stimulate labor. The drug can cause painful contractions, which doctors treat with an epidural painkiller. The epidural can then retard contractions and lead to more drugs, fetal stress and the doctor's recommendation of a Caesarean. Natural-birth advocates say that hospitals, driven by profits and worried about malpractice, are too quick to intervene. \"I compare it to a restaurant. If you have customers who sit at a table and don't order anything, you're not making any money,\" says Jennifer Block, author of \"Pushed: The Painful Truth About Childbirth and Modern Maternity Care.\" Normal labor, Block says, isn't profitable (according to \"The Business of Being Born,\" a Caesarean can cost three times as much as a normal birth). If something does go wrong, in the eyes of the courts \"a normal birth is a risk. The courts reward action,\" Block says.\n\nSome doctors say the increased rate of Caesareans is partially attributable to maternal demand: busy mothers may want to schedule their deliveries. The phrase \"too posh to push\" predates Posh Spice, but reports that celebrities such as Posh (Victoria Beckham) and Britney Spears had Caesareans have popularized the procedure, some doctors say. And some women are scheduling them early. According to the March of Dimes, late preterm delivery (34 to 36 weeks) increased from 7.3 percent to 8.9 percent between 1990 and 2004 in the United States. \"No one knows how much of that is maternal choice,\" says Ann Stark, head of neonatology at Texas Children's Hospital. \"There are certainly women who want timed, elective delivery surgically.\" According to a recent study, attendance at Lamaze classes, which teach women how to manage labor pain without drugs, dropped 14 percent between 2000 and 2005.\n\nAlthough the United States has one the highest rates of Caesareans\u2014and of infant mortality\u2014Villar says the rest of the developed world is catching up. But opinion differs on how to respond. Doctors such as Stark say we need a better sense of what goes on while the baby is still in utero. \"One of the knowledge gaps is a clear understanding of the indications for C-sections,\" she says. (Known indications include breech position of the fetus, and pre-existing medical conditions such as extreme hypertension in the mother.) Naomi Wolf, author of \"Misconceptions: Truth, Lies, and the Unexpected on the Journey to Motherhood,\" blames insurance companies and hospitals, who she says deny women information about their choices.

But it does suggest that laparoscopy could actually save thousands of dollars for some patients, when all costs \u2014 including physician fees, hospital fees and readmissions \u2014 are considered.\n\n\u201cYou really want to look at the total cost, because that\u2019s what society has to pay,\u201d said Dr. Dmitry Oleynikov, who heads the Center for Advanced Surgical Technology at Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha and led the new study.\n\n\u201cOverall, this study shows benefit from laparoscopy on every aspect, including cost,\u201d he told Reuters Health.\n\nAppendix removals are one of the most common surgeries in the U.S., with some 750,000 procedures done every year, Oleynikov added.\n\nWith his colleagues, he looked back at some 40,000 such surgeries done at dozens of academic medical centers in the U.S. \u2014 roughly 14,000 open procedures and 26,000 laparoscopic ones.\n\nFor uncomplicated cases of appendicitis, in which the appendix is still intact, the tabs for the two surgeries came out about the same, at just over $7,800.\n\nPeople who had the laparoscopic procedures also had lower death rates, at 0.07 percent versus 0.17 percent, fewer readmissions and a slightly shorter stay at the hospital.\n\nWhen the appendix had burst, however, the open surgery racked up a considerably higher bill. On average, it cost $17,594, compared to $12,125 for the laparoscopic surgery.\n\nYet again, the patients who had laparoscopy fared much better than those who had conventional surgery.\n\n\u201cIn healthy individuals, the death rate is very (small) for all groups of patients. But when you become sicker, laparoscopy is better,\u201d said Oleynikov. \u201cSubstantial savings could be seen if open surgery is done in a laparoscopic fashion.\u201d\n\nBut he acknowledged that the study has major limitations. First, it looks only at academic medical centers. And second, it\u2019s not a randomized controlled trial, which means the patients being compared could be different in important ways, explaining at least part of the outcomes of the two types of surgery.\n\nIndeed, those who had laparoscopy were younger and usually had less severe disease, which could have biased the results in favor of the minimally invasive procedure.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The widespread use of laparascopic appendectomy was clear in the story.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Although effective for the treatment of diabetes, exercise is sometimes difficult for overweight or elderly people. A new wearable medical device developed by Kumamoto University has been found to effect visceral fat loss and improve blood glucose (sugar). The current study reports clinical trial results for optimal use frequency.\n\nType 2 diabetes is a disease of systemic organ failure due to chronic hyperglycemia and inflammation from the accumulation of excess visceral fat. Metabolic disorders such as hyperglycemia attenuate stress resistance in the human body and exacerbate insulin resistance. The ability of insulin to lower blood sugar levels is reduced and insulin secretion is decreased.\n\nThe heat shock response (HSR) is activated as a response to stress in the human body, but its function decreased in those with type 2 diabetes. A research team from Kumamoto University, Japan has found that by restoring the function of HSP72, the main protein of HSR, improved glucose-related abnormalities. The team found that a suitable combination of mild electrical stimulation (MES) with heat shock (HS) activated HSP72 more efficiently.\n\nThe researchers developed a belt-type medical device that uses a special type of rubber to transmit MES and HS at the same time. They then performed a clinical trial of MES + HS on 40 obese men suffering from type 2 diabetes. Results showed a decrease fasting glucose levels, a loss of visceral fat, improve insulin resistance, and a significant (-0.43%) improvement in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values. About half of all subjects (52.5%) achieved less than 7.0% HbA1c, which is a treatment goal for diabetes. The first trial showed that activation of the HSR produced a large therapeutic effect.\n\nIn the researcher's next clinical trial, 60 obese patients with type 2 diabetes from both genders were given a 12-week treatment with the belt-shaped MES+HS medical device. Trial subjects received treatments for 60 minutes each time, and were separated into three groups of 2, 4, and 7 treatments per week. This determined the most effective treatment frequency.\n\nThe reduction in the visceral fat area was 5.37 sq. cm in the 2 treatment per week group, 14.24 sq. cm in the 4 per week group and 16.45 sq. cm in the 7 per week group. Declines in HbA1c were 0.10%, 0.36%, and 0.65% in the 2, 4, and 7 treatment-per-week groups respectively. Improvements in chronic inflammation, fatty liver markers, renal function and lipid profile were also shown. Furthermore, adding the MES+HS treatment to a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is the most often used therapeutic drug for diabetes in Japan, showed an even stronger blood glucose improvement.\n\n\"This device is very easy to use since it simply attaches to the abdomen, and it has a low-impact on the patient. One can expect the effects to be similar to exercise therapy,\" said Dr. Tatsuya Kondo, who lead the research. \"Even in patients who have difficulty exercising, such as those who are overweight, elderly, or have some form of disability, this device can be expected to provide acceptable treatment in addition to conventional diabetic medical care.\"\n\nThis research was posted online in the nature.com journal Scientific Reports on October 19th, 2016.\n\nT.

The research was only meant to show that, so far, it seems feasible and safe.\n\nThe concept was based on the astonishing case of an AIDS patient who seems to be cured after getting blood cells from a donor with natural immunity to HIV nearly four years ago in Berlin. Researchers are seeking a more practical way to achieve similar immunity using patients' own blood cells.\n\nThe results announced Monday at a conference in Boston left experts cautiously excited.\n\n\"For the first time, people are beginning to think about a cure\" as a real possibility, said Dr. John Zaia, head of the government panel that oversees gene therapy experiments. Even if the new approach doesn't get rid of HIV completely, it may repair patients' immune systems enough that they can control the virus and not need AIDS medicines - \"what is called a functional cure,\" he said.\n\nCarl Dieffenbach, AIDS chief at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed.\n\n\"We're hopeful that this is sufficient to give the level of immune reconstitution similar to what was seen with the patient from Germany,\" he said.\n\nThis is the first time researchers have permanently deleted a human gene and infused the altered cells back into patients. Other gene therapy attempts tried to add a gene or muffle the activity of one, and have not worked against HIV.\n\nThe virus can damage the immune system for years before people develop symptoms and are said to have AIDS - acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The virus targets special immune system soldiers called T-cells. It usually enters these cells through a protein receptor, or \"docking station,\" called CCR5.\n\nSome people (about 1 percent of whites; fewer of minorities) lack both copies of the CCR5 gene and are naturally resistant to HIV. One such person donated blood stem cells in 2007 to an American man living in Berlin who had leukemia and HIV.\n\nThe cell transplant appears to have cured both problems, but finding such donors for everyone with HIV is impossible, and transplants are medically risky.\n\nSo scientists wondered: Could a patient's own cells be used to knock out the CCR5 gene and create resistance to HIV?\n\nA California biotechnology company, Sangamo (SANG-uh-moh) BioSciences Inc., makes a treatment that can cut DNA at precise locations and permanently \"edit out\" a gene.\n\nDr. Jacob Lalezari, director of Quest Clinical Research of San Francisco, led the first test of this with the company and colleagues at the University of California in San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nHe warned that it would be \"way overstated\" to suggest that the results so far are a possible cure.\n\n\"It's an overreach of the data. There are a lot of people out there with hopes and dreams around the C-word,\" so caution is needed.\n\nIn the study, six men with HIV had their blood filtered to remove a small percentage of their T-cells. The gene-snipping compound was added in the lab, and about one-fourth of the cells were successfully modified. The cells were mixed with growth factors to make them multiply and then infused back into the patients.\n\nThree men received about 2.5 billion modified cells. Three others received about 5 billion.\n\nThree months later, five men had three times the number of modified cells expected. As much as 6 percent of their total T-cells appear to be the new type - resistant to HIV, Lalezari said.\n\nThe sixth man also had modified cells, but fewer than expected. In all six patients, the anti-HIV cells were thriving nearly a year after infusion, even in tissues that can hide HIV when it can't be detected in blood.\n\n\"The cells are engrafting - they're staying in the bloodstream, they're expanding over time,\" said Lalezari, who has no personal financial ties to Sangamo, the study's sponsor.\n\nThe only side effect was two days of flulike symptoms. It will take longer to determine safety, but several AIDS experts said they were encouraged so far.\n\n\"It is a huge step\" and a first for the field of genetics, said John Rossi, a researcher at City of Hope in Duarte, Calif., where he and Zaia plan another study to test Sangamo's approach. \"The idea is if you take away cells the virus can infect, you can cure the disease.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Dr. Carl June, a gene therapy expert at the University of Pennsylvania, will report partial results from a second, federally funded study of 10 people testing Sangamo's product. He treated his first patient with it in July 2009.\n\n- People born without the CCR5 gene are generally healthy, but will deleting it have unforeseen consequences?\n\n- Will HIV find another way into cells? Certain types of the virus can use a second protein receptor, though this is less common and usually when AIDS is advanced. Sangamo is testing a similar approach aimed at that protein, too.\n\n- How long will the modified cells last? Will more be needed every few years?\n\n- Could doctors just infuse Sangamo's product rather than removing cells and modifying them in the lab?\n\n- What might this cost?\n\nSangamo spokeswoman Liz Wolffe said it's too early in testing to guess, but it would be \"a premier-priced\" therapy - in the neighborhood of Dendreon Corp.'s new prostate cancer immune therapy, Provenge - $93,000.\n\nYet AIDS drugs can cost $25,000 a year, so this could still be cost-effective, especially if it's a cure.\n\nJay Johnson, 50, who works for Action AIDS, an advocacy and service organization in Philadelphia, had the treatment there in September.\n\n\"My results are excellent,\" he said. \"The overall goal is to not have to take medication, and then hopefully lead maybe to a cure.\"\n\nMatt Sharp, 54, of suburban San Francisco, also had the treatment in September.\n\n\"I would trade anything to not have to take a handful of medications every day for the rest of my life and suffer all the consequences and side effects,\" he said.\n\n\"I may not live long enough to see the cure, but I always hoped for a chance.\"", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story\u00a0 made it clear that this was a very preliminary report.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Newswise \u2014 SAN FRANCISCO, March 16, 2017\u2014-Patients in their 80s and 90s who have early stage lung cancer but cannot undergo an operation can be treated safely and effectively with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), according to research presented today at the 2017 Multidisciplinary Thoracic Cancers Symposium. The advanced form of radiation therapy (RT) was well tolerated among this relatively understudied elderly population, indicating that SBRT is a viable option for patients who may otherwise be offered no curative treatment.\n\nWhile the primary treatment for early stage lung cancer is surgical removal of the tumor, some patients may not be able to tolerate surgery due to health status, advanced age or other factors. For these patients, the best curative option is SBRT, a specialized type of external beam RT that uses advanced imaging techniques to deliver extremely targeted radiation to a tumor. This high degree of precision makes SBRT particularly effective at sparing surrounding healthy tissue, which is important for tumor sites near essential organs, such as the heart and lungs. Patients complete SBRT treatment in three to five days, compared with several weeks for conventional RT.\n\n\u201cWhile multiple studies and trials have established the effectiveness of SBRT for inoperable early-stage lung cancer, one of the common reasons for not giving radiation in older patients is concern about tolerating the treatment and potential side effects,\u201d said Richard J. Cassidy III, MD, lead author of the study and a resident in radiation oncology at Emory University\u2019s Winship Cancer Institute in Atlanta. \u201cThe low rates of side effects from SBRT for this elderly population in our study indicate that these concerns should not prevent physicians from considering definitive treatment for their inoperable octogenarian and nonagenarian patients with early stage lung cancer.\u201d\n\nFindings are based on a retrospective analysis of 58 consecutive patients who received definitive lung SBRT across four academic sites within Emory between 2010 and 2015. All patients were age 80 or older at the time of their diagnosis, with a median age of 84.9 years. Forty percent of the tumors were adenocarcinomas, while 29 percent were squamous cell carcinomas and 31 percent did not have a biopsy. Fifty percent of patients who did not have a biopsy had a previous history of lung cancer. Researchers used logistic regression and proportional hazard testing to determine the association of patient, tumor and treatment characteristics to compare rates of survival, recurrence and progression and assess the influence of patient and disease characteristics. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was conducted to determine which patients were most likely to benefit from therapy.\n\nAt two years following definitive SBRT for lung cancer among elderly patients, survival rates were 73 percent for cancer specific survival (CSS) and 57 percent for overall survival (OS). CSS rates were higher for patients who were not active smokers but lower for patients who were older or had a previous lung cancer diagnosis (smoking Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.14, p = 0.03; age HR = 1.19, p = 0.04; cancer HR = 7.75, p = 0.01). OS rates were higher for patients with higher Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), which measures a patient\u2019s functional ability to perform ordinary tasks, such as work and self-care (HR = 0.91; p < 0.01). Researchers determined that this metric should be considered when offering SBRT in this elderly population, with certain performance status criterion (i.e., KPS \u2265 75) associated with significantly improved outcomes. Two-year estimates of local control and regional control were 84.5 percent and 71.7 percent, respectively. Local failure was more common among patients with adenocarcinomas (HR = 6.36, p = 0.01) and less common for patients with T1 tumors (HR = 0.20, p < 0.01). Higher KPS scores were associated with lower rates of both local failure (HR = 0.92, p < 0.01) and regional failure (HR = 0.94, p < 0.01). In terms of toxicity, just over one-third of patients (34.5%) experienced radiation pneumonitis of any grade, with only two patients experiencing grade 3+ pneumonitis. Pneumonitis was more frequent among patients who were not actively using ace-inhibitors (Odds Ratio (OR) = 3.49, p = 0.02) and less frequent in smaller tumors (OR = 0.03, p < 0.01).\n\n\u201cOur study, along with other studies, helps to show that SBRT can effectively and safely add years to the lives of elderly patients who have early stage lung cancer but cannot undergo an operation for it,\u201d said Dr. Cassidy. \u201cElderly patients, who are otherwise doing well, should not have treatment withheld based solely on concerns about side effects and age.\u201d\n\nThe abstract, \u201cStereotactic body radiotherapy for early stage non-small cell lung cancer in patients 80 years and older: A multi-center analysis,\u201d will be presented in detail during the poster session at the 2017 Multidisciplinary Thoracic Cancers Symposium in San Francisco (full details below).

He's an associate professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia.\n\n\"There is a tremendous lack of kidneys for transplant,\" he explained. \"Because of the opioid crisis, there are many people who die from a drug overdose and have HCV and want to donate their organs.\"\n\nBut these infected kidneys are discarded, even though they are otherwise healthy. And many are from younger people, Reese said.\n\nOf roughly a half-million patients in the United States who were on dialysis for late-stage kidney disease in 2016, only 19,000 received kidney transplants. This is partly due to organ shortages, researchers have reported. And the average wait time for a non-infected kidney is more than two years, compared to eight months for an HCV-infected kidney.\n\nNew, less toxic treatments for hepatitis C opened the door for transplanting infected kidneys and then successfully treating the infection, Reese said.\n\nIn a study of 20 uninfected patients, researchers found that transplanting infected kidneys and then treating recipients for HCV resulted in a 100 percent cure rate. Half were evaluated six months after their transplant and the others a year after.\n\n\"And we found that these kidney transplants were working as well as kidney transplants from uninfected patients,\" Reese said.\n\nThe potential cost savings could be significant, he added. Dialysis can cost more than $88,000 a year, according to the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.\n\nThough some patients might not want to take the risk associated with an infected kidney, others might consider it a good option, given the high death rates for dialysis patients awaiting transplants, the researchers suggested.\n\nThe report was published online Aug. 6 in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nDr. Adnan Sharif, a consultant transplant nephrologist at Queen Elizabeth Hospital and University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom, wrote an accompanying editorial.\n\nSharif said the excellent short-term outcomes and 100 percent cure rate of HCV in organ recipients should prompt transplant centers to rethink use of HCV-infected kidneys.\n\n\"We must be bold in our approach to utilizing HCV kidneys,\" he said.\n\nSharif acknowledged, however, that using HCV-infected kidneys would represent \"a significant shift in our attitude to risk, procurement of organs and counseling potential recipients appropriately about the risks -- albeit minimal.\"\n\nBut the cost effectiveness of using these kidneys versus remaining on dialysis would be significant, he noted.\n\nAnother study, published in the same journal in July, reported similar success in transplants of HCV-infected kidneys into HCV-infected patients. About 15 percent of dialysis patients have HCV, the researchers said.\n\nSharif said other organs from HCV-infected donors, such as hearts and lungs, might also be safely transplanted, expanding those organs' supply, as well.\n\n\"Using such donors could lead to many life-saving or enhancing transplants,\" he said.\n\nTo learn more about kidney transplants, visit the National Kidney Foundation.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story could have done a better job of explaining what steps would need to be taken to make kidneys and other organs from infected donors available. Who would have to approve of this protocol? And what further evidence is required to confirm that it\u2019s safe?\nMoreover, it\u2019s not clear how much the wait would be shortened by making HCV-infected kidneys available to patients who don\u2019t have the virus. According to data cited in an accompanying editorial, 3,562 kidneys from donors with HCV have been discarded in the U.S. since 1995; that number seems small compared to the number of people in need of a kidney.\nAlso, given a rise in HCV-infected kidneys from young donors due to the opioid crisis, it seems that efforts to curb opioid misuse might diminish the availability of those organs.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "(Reuters) - Patients who have robot-assisted surgeries on their kidneys or prostate have shorter hospital stays and a lower risk of having a blood transfusion or dying \u2014 but the bill is significantly higher, a study found.\n\nThe analysis, which appeared in the Journal of Urology, compared increasingly common robotic surgery with two other techniques for the same surgery and found that direct costs can be up to several thousand dollars higher for the robotic type.\n\nTouted as less invasive and more efficient, robotic surgeries typically use a laparoscopic or \u201ckeyhold surgery\u201d approach, in which tools and a tiny video camera are inserted into the body through one or two small incisions.\n\nRobotic surgery replaces a surgeon\u2019s hands with ultra-precise tools at the ends of mechanical arms, all operated by the surgeon from a console.\n\n\u201cI think the take home message is that robotic (surgery), looking at our study, had certain beneficial outcomes compared to open and laparoscopic procedures,\u201d said study leader Jim Hu at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston.\n\nHu and his team analyzed surgery data from a national government database to see if the costlier robotic surgeries were cost effective with extra benefits over older techniques.\n\nDuring the last three months of 2008 \u2014 the most recent data available that allowed a comparison among robotic, open and laparoscopic surgeries \u2014 more than half of all prostate removals involved robot-assisted surgery.\n\nAbout three percent of prostate patients had standard laparoscopic surgery and 44 percent had open surgery.

Such patients need anticlotting drugs because blood clots can be a deadly complication of getting a stent.\n\nPlavix is the drug most often used to prevent this complication. But there's a problem with Plavix, and with a newer, stronger drug in the same class called Effient.\n\nBoth drugs increase the risk of dangerous bleeding. And since the drugs irreversibly bind to blood-clotting platelets, a patient has to stop taking these drugs for five to seven days before the body can make enough new platelets.\n\nBrilinta lets go of platelets more quickly than Plavix -- in about two or three days. And in the new study, patients had less bleeding after stent installation.\n\nThat's probably why the 6,732 study patients who got Brilinta were 16% less likely to die, or have a heart attack or stroke, than were the 6,676 patients who got Plavix. Brilinta reduced overall death rates by 1.1% .\n\n\"We estimate that use of [Brilinta] instead of [Plavix] for one year in 1,000 patients with acute coronary syndromes and who are planning to undergo an invasive strategy at the start of drug treatment would lead to 11 fewer deaths, 13 fewer myocardial infarctions, and six fewer cases of stent [clotting] without an increase in the rates of major bleeding or transfusion,\" conclude study researcher Christopher P.

Nearly a quarter of a million people worldwide have leprosy, which causes disfiguration of the skin and mucous membranes as well as progressive and incurable nerve damage. While drug therapy exists for leprosy, it must be taken for many months, has many side effects and often is given too late to reverse the permanent damage caused by the bacterial infection. A viable vaccine to prevent and/or treat leprosy is the next step in the effort to bring this disease to an end.\n\nScientists at IDRI, along with national and international collaborators including the National Hansen's Disease Program and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, with financial support from American Leprosy Missions, have developed a promising leprosy vaccine candidate designed to help treat leprosy and prevent exposed individuals from developing disease and the resulting disabilities. Based on data generated in preclinical studies, the vaccine candidate, called LepVax, has progressed to Phase I clinical testing in the United States, the first stage of safety testing in human volunteers. The clinical trial is focused on safety, as well as evaluating the immune response to the vaccine.\n\n\"While previous attempts have used vaccines primarily developed for other diseases, this is the first totally defined vaccine candidate developed specifically for leprosy, using the latest technologies and offering no less than those exposed to leprosy deserve,\" said Steven Reed, Ph.D., IDRI President, CEO & Founder. \"The leprosy vaccine program at IDRI has benefited greatly from what we've learned in the development of tuberculosis vaccine candidates over the past two decades. Although the bacteria that cause tuberculosis and leprosy are related, leprosy vaccine development posed great challenges. This vaccine represents a unique accomplishment, requiring the most advanced technologies in molecular biology and immunology, and American Leprosy Missions has been there from the beginning.\" IDRI scientists have also developed two vaccine candidates for tuberculosis, both in clinical stages of development.\n\n\"We are thrilled that after 15 years and an investment of over $5.1 million, made possible by our faithful donors and partners, a leprosy-specific vaccine is beginning a Phase I clinical trial,\" says Bill Simmons, President and CEO of American Leprosy Missions. \"We believe this may be the most exciting breakthrough in leprosy treatment since multi-drug therapy, the current treatment for leprosy, was launched in the 1980s. We look forward to this vaccine improving the health outcomes of people diagnosed with leprosy. And, it may be that this vaccine can lead to interruption of the transmission of leprosy all together. What a tremendous legacy this would leave for millions of people worldwide.\"\n\nThe vaccine was developed through significant efforts in screening and identifying M. leprae proteins that trigger an effective immune response. IDRI scientists then produced a fusion of four leprosy proteins, which is combined with IDRI's proprietary immune-stimulating adjuvant (GLA-SE). With recent developments in vaccine technology, IDRI scientists can now induce protective responses even after infection, meaning it could be possible to prevent disease development in people already infected with the leprosy bacterium.\n\n\"This generation of a vaccine to prevent and possibly treat leprosy is the result of years of research. The development has been complicated by the fact that the organism that causes leprosy cannot be grown in culture in the laboratory,\" Reed explained. \"This is a unique example of a vaccine produced by totally synthetic methods.\"\n\nReed added that, without the foresight and support of American Leprosy Missions, there would be no leprosy vaccine candidate. \"The vision and support of American Leprosy Missions has been tremendous as we've worked with them throughout the years, moving from our work in developing a leprosy diagnostic to our current focus on a successful leprosy vaccine,\" he said. \"The progress we've had to date would not have been possible without American Leprosy Missions' financial support and guidance.\" Early results from the Phase I study should be available in 2018, and the partners are currently exploring mechanisms to advance the vaccine through later-phase clinical trials should results from the Phase I study (clinical trial NCT03302897) support further evaluation.\n\nThe vaccine candidate will serve as part of an overall strategy to end leprosy, which will require detection, prevention and treatment. IDRI had developed technology to enable a rapid, affordable, point-of-care diagnostic test, which was funded by NIAID (grant numbers 1R43AI066613-01A1 and 2R44AI066613-02.)\n\nIn addition to IDRI and American Leprosy Missions, a variety of partners are taking part in efforts to eliminate leprosy, including Novartis and the Novartis Foundation. Reed, along with scientists from a variety of scientific organizations recently published \"Innovative tools and approaches to end the transmission of Mycobacterium leprae\" in , outlining what is needed to achieve this goal. Together with scientific, government and NGO partners, the Novartis Foundation develops and implements strategies to help interrupt leprosy transmission, while Novartis donates the treatment for leprosy free of charge.\n\nAbout IDRI: As a nonprofit global health organization, IDRI (Infectious Disease Research Institute) takes a comprehensive approach to combat infectious diseases, combining the high-quality science of a research organization with the product development capabilities of a biotech company to create new diagnostics, drugs and vaccines.

Ninety percent of them started taking preventive medicines after finding out.\n\nResearchers say the two-generation benefits may convince more parents to agree to cholesterol testing for their kids. An expert panel in the United States recommends this test for children between the ages of 9 and 11, but many aren\u2019t tested now unless they are obese or have other heart risk factors such as diabetes or high blood pressure.\n\nFor every 1,000 people screened in the study, four children and four parents were identified as being at risk for early heart disease. That\u2019s nearly twice as many as most studies in the past have suggested.\n\n\u201cWe really need to pay attention to this,\u201d said Dr. Elaine Urbina, director of preventive cardiology at Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center and a member of the US. expert panel. \u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to screen for something that\u2019s common, dangerous and has a treatment that\u2019s effective and safe.\u201d\n\nDr. William Cooper, a pediatrics and preventive medicine professor at Vanderbilt University, called it \u201can innovative approach\u201d that finds not just kids at risk but also parents while they\u2019re still young enough to benefit from preventive treatment, such as cholesterol-lowering statin drugs.\n\nStatins aren\u2019t recommended until around age 10, but certain dietary supplements such as plant sterols and stanols could help younger kids, Urbina said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about putting all these kids on statins,\u201d she said.\n\nThe study was led by Dr. David Wald at Queen Mary University of London. He and another author founded a company that makes a combination pill to prevent heart disease. The work was funded by the Medical Research Council, the British government\u2019s health research agency. Results were published Wednesday by the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nResearchers were testing for familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic disorder that, untreated, raises the risk of a heart attack by age 40 tenfold.\n\nThey did a heel-stick blood test on 10,059 children ages 1 to 2 during routine immunization visits to check for high cholesterol and 48 gene mutations that can cause the disorder. If a child was found with the disorder, parents were tested.\n\nOne in 270 children had the gene mutations; others were identified through cholesterol levels alone.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty common genetic defect,\u201d said Dr. Stephen Daniels, chairman of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and a member of the US expert panel.\n\nBut many parents balk at the idea of testing children for a disorder associated with middle age, experts say.\n\nKaren Teber, a media relations specialist in Madison, Wis., was surprised when a doctor wanted to test her 12-year-old stepson. \u201cMy reluctance was really born out of lack of information,\u201d she said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard of it before.\u201d\n\nThe study did not address whether screening is cost-effective.

This year, 4,400 patients are expected to undergo surgery to replace arthritic or injured ankles with artificial joints made of metal alloys and lightweight plastic, according to industry estimates.\n\nFour models are commonly used in the United States, with Food and Drug Administration approval. And demand is expected to grow as more and more baby boomers hobble into their 60s and 70s with debilitating ankle pain.\n\nAnkle replacement has been around for three decades, but it has been slow to catch on. Problems with early devices left surgeons and patients wary. The operation is complex, and many foot and ankle surgeons lack experience. While Medicare pays for ankle replacement, many private insurers do not.\n\nEach year about two million Americans visit the doctor for ankle pain from arthritis or fracture. An estimated 50,000 people a year experience end-stage ankle arthritis, in which the ankle cartilage has worn away completely, causing painful bone-on-bone contact and some level of disability.\n\nUntil lately, such patients have had only one surgical option: ankle fusion surgery, in which the worn-out part of the joint is removed and the bones are permanently locked together with screws and plates. The procedure usually relieves pain, but the patient loses mobility in the ankle, leading to changes in gait and, ultimately, additional wear and tear and arthritic pain in other parts of the ankle. About 25,000 ankle fusions were performed in the United States last year.\n\nAndrew Keaveney, now 73, shattered his ankle in a fall from a truck while hanging flags as an American Legion volunteer. Surgery repaired the broken bones, but he continued to have severe pain.\n\nDoctors suggested ankle fusion, but he found a surgeon who offered total ankle replacement. He had the operation in December 2008, and now he says the ankle is \u201c99 percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore the surgery, I couldn\u2019t sleep at night,\u201d said Mr. Keaveney, of Locust Valley, N.Y. \u201cNow I\u2019m able to climb ladders. I have absolutely no pain. I was even playing soccer with my grandkids a few months ago.\u201d\n\nHis surgeon, Dr. Craig S. Radnay, an associate at the Insall Scott Kelly Institute for Orthopedics and Sports Medicine in New York City and on Long Island, says he is now a \u201cbig believer\u201d in ankle replacement for certain patients.\n\n\u201cFor an ankle replacement you have to be a little more picky in who you select for those cases,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t tell you how many patients come in, and I mention this option they don\u2019t even know exists.\u201d (Dr. Radnay, who says he has performed more than 100 ankle replacements using an Inbone device from Wright Medical Group of Arlington, Tenn., is now a paid consultant to the company, helping to gather data on long-term success rates.)\n\nThe ideal patient is around 60 years old and of normal weight, although doctors consider older patients, depending on their health. People with diabetes may not be good candidates because they may risk complications as a result of poor blood circulation.\n\nDr. Jonathan T. Deland, chief of the foot and ankle service at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan, said that while the devices had improved, he remained cautious about offering the operation. (Dr. Deland is helping to develop a new ankle replacement device for Zimmer of Warsaw, Ind., which may be submitted for F.D.A. approval this year.)\n\n\u201cThe big concern about ankle replacement is how often do they fail and how often do they loosen,\u201d he said.\n\nComplications can include slow healing, as well as infection. Severe complications are rare, but they can result in amputation. Still, Dr. Deland said, \u201cwe\u2019re getting fewer and fewer failures.\u201d\n\nThe new models require that less bone be removed, so the bone to which the device is affixed is stronger. In addition, instruments used to guide surgeons in aligning the artificial joint have improved. Dr. Deland cited data showing that for some recent models, 90 percent of ankle replacements were still in place after an average of eight and a half years.\n\nThough the four devices in common use have technical differences in design and in how they are implanted, doctors say the choice of device matters far less than the experience of the surgeon. The procedure is among the most difficult that foot and ankle surgeons perform, and one of the biggest challenges is getting proper alignment of the replacement joint.\n\nDr. Brian Donley, an orthopedic surgeon who is director of the foot and ankle center at the Cleveland Clinic, says patients should always ask their doctor to disclose any financial interest in a device. (He performed the first United States operation using the Salto Talaris device from Tornier of Minneapolis, and receives consulting fees from the company.)\n\nEven with a successful implantation, patients should not necessarily expect to have the same ankles they did at 18. They should not try to return to activities like basketball and distance running. But golf and walking, and sometimes even skiing, are typically allowed.\n\n\u201cMy happiest patients I have in my practice are my ankle replacement patients,\u201d Dr. Donley said. \u201cThey are so appreciative about how their life has been changed.

Such fasting already shows benefits after only six weeks. This is according to a study by Kyoung-Han Kim and Yun Hye Kim in the journal Cell Research which is published by Springer Nature. Intermittent fasting in mice helped to kick-start the animals' metabolism and to burn fat by generating body heat. The research team was led by Hoon-Ki Sung of The Hospital for Sick Children in Ontario, Canada.\n\nResearch has shown that our unhealthy eating habits and sedentary lifestyles are playing a major role in the development of lifestyle-related metabolic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and obesity. For this reason, dietary interventions like intermittent fasting are gaining popularity to treat conditions such as obesity.\n\nThe research team in this study wanted to better understand the reactions that interventions such as fasting trigger on a molecular level in the body. They exposed groups of mice to sixteen weeks of intermittent fasting. The recurring regimen saw the animals being fed for two days, followed by one day without anything to eat. Their calorie intake was not adjusted otherwise. Four months later the mice in the fasting group weighed less than those in the control group who continued to eat the same volume of food. The lower body weight of the mice in the fasting group was not the only effect. The fasting regime helped lower fat build-up in the white fat by increasing the brown-like fat (involved in burning energy and producing body heat) of mice on the high fat diet. Their glucose and insulin systems also remained more stable. In a further experiment, similar benefits were already seen after only six weeks of intermittent fasting.\n\nThrough an analysis into the underlying biology involved, the researchers found that such intermittent fasting tempers an immune reaction in fat cells. There are changes in certain gene pathways involved in the immune system and the body's reaction to inflammation. A type of white blood cell known to play a role in fighting inflammation is triggered. Known as anti-inflammatory macrophages, these cells stimulate the fat cells to burn stored fats or lipids by generating heat. This happens during periods of intermittent fasting because there is an increase in vascular growth factor (VEGF) that help form blood vessels and activate anti-inflammatory macrophage.\n\n\"Intermittent fasting without a reduction in calorie intake can be a preventative and therapeutic approach against obesity and metabolic disorders,\" says Kyoung-Han Kim.\n\n\"Strikingly, these fasting-stimulated changes in the growth of vascular cells and subsequent immune alterations occur even after a single cycle of 24-hour fasting, and are completely reversed when mice start eating again,\" adds Yun Hye Kim.\n\nReference: Kim, K-H. et al (2017).

At study enrollment, none had signs of dementia. The participants were recruited from people already taking part in the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a study of residents of more than 40 retirement communities and senior public housing units across northern Illinois, plus older adults identified through church groups and social service agencies.\n\nDuring the course of the study, each person received annual, standardized testing for cognitive ability in five areas -- episodic memory, working memory, semantic memory, visuospatial ability and perceptual speed. The study group also completed annual food frequency questionnaires, allowing the researchers to compare participants' reported seafood intake with changes in their cognitive abilities as measured by the tests.\n\nThe questionnaires included four types of seafood: tuna sandwiches; fish sticks, fish cakes and fish sandwiches; fresh fish as a main dish; and shrimp, lobster and crab. The participants were divided into two groups: those who ate at least one of those seafood meals per week and those who ate less than one of those seafood meals per week.\n\nParticipants in the higher seafood consumption group ate an average of two seafood meals per week. Those in the lower group ate an average of 0.5 meals per week.\n\nSeafood is the direct nutrient source of a type of omega-3 fatty acid (docosahexaenoic acid) that is the main structural component of the brain. While epidemiologic studies have shown the importance of seafood and omega-3 fatty acids in preventing dementia, few prior studies have examined their associations with specific types of cognitive ability.\n\nIn the new Neurology article, the researchers report associations between seafood consumption and two of the areas of cognitive ability that they tested. People who ate more seafood had reduced rates of decline in the semantic memory, which is memory of verbal information. They also had slower rates of decline in a test of perceptual speed, or the ability to quickly compare letters, objects and patterns.\n\nThe study did not find a significant difference in the rate of decline in episodic memory (recollection of personal experiences), working memory (short-term memory used in mental function in the immediate present) and visuospatial ability (comprehension of relationships between objects).\n\nThe results were the same after researchers adjusted for other factors that could affect memory and thinking skills, such as education, physical activity, smoking and participating in mentally stimulating activities.\n\nFurther, the protective association of seafood was even stronger among individuals with a common genotype (APOE-\u03b54) that increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The APOE is a gene involved in cholesterol transport to neurons.

It's like a death sentence,\" says, Anselmo, now 59.\n\nOnly for her it wasn't.\n\nAnselmo's successful treatment shows how precision medicine \u2014 tailoring therapy to each patient's genetic needs \u2014 is beginning to transform cancer care.\n\nAt first, the outlook seemed grim. Although Anselmo's surgeon was able to surgically remove most of her tumor, she couldn't tolerate traditional chemotherapy that was the planned second step, and had to discontinue it.\n\nThe chemo failure was the latest in a string of personal setbacks.\n\nThe year before she was diagnosed with brain cancer, she'd lost her son to suicide. Weeks after that she was almost killed in a car crash outside a local mall. Her cancer was discovered after she had a dizzy spell, and her husband, Joseph, insisted she return to the hospital to have it checked out.\n\nAfter all that, Anselmo and her husband weren't ready to give up on her cancer fight. He'd read about advances in targeted therapies \u2014 drugs that go after cancer cells at the molecular level.\n\nThe family sent samples of her tumor samples for genetic testing to several leading cancer hospitals. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where she was being treated, also did its own sequencing. They all found the same thing. Anselmo's tumor had a BRAF mutation common in skin cancer, but very unusual for a brain tumor.\n\nHer oncologist, David Hyman at Memorial Sloan Kettering, enrolled Anselmo into a new kind of drug trial. Called a basket trial, the study is designed to include people whose tumors have the same kind of genetic fingerprint regardless of where in the body the tumors are found.\n\nKnowing more about the genetic mutations of a tumor enables doctors to find a potentially effective drug much more quickly and accurately. \"It's like you're in a parking lot,\" Hyman says. \"And you have a key to one of the cars in the parking lot. And so one option is just to go to each car and try to open the lock. The other is to know that it's the third car on the right. What we're doing now is we're saying, OK, this key fits that lock. And we're only going straight to that car.\"\n\nToday, Anselmo is doing well. She's been in the clinical trial for a year now, and continues to take Zelboraf (or vemurafenib generically) daily. The pills have kept her cancer from growing.\n\nThere are side effects, of course. She's lost some peripheral vision, though she's been able to compensate. And Zelboraf is expensive, though it's free to Anselmo because she's taking it as part of a study.\n\nNow she can focus again on the things she loves, like singing. Anselmo, a jazz singer who performed under the stage name Mariel Larsen before her illness, is planning a comeback. She's back in training with her longtime vocal coach.\n\nAs this kind of genetic sequencing of tumors has become faster and cheaper, more patients have access to this technology. More doctors are taking advantage of the information to treat patients with a targeted approach.\n\n\"We took a disease where nothing really works for any length of time and we've given her a year of life, and hopefully much more, where she's been much better,\" Hyman, her oncologist, says.\n\nStill, he cautions that the targeted treatments can't be considered cures. At some point the drug that is keeping Anselmo's cancer at bay could stop working. \"Every patient is different in how long it works,\" he says. \"We all have patients that have been on these drugs for years. But I don't know, I mean, I think if I was being honest eventually our expectation would be that it would stop working.\"\n\nThere's no way to predict when.

The treatment does not cure hay fever but is generally effective at reducing symptoms. However, inconvenience and discomfort limits patients\u2019 willingness to try allergy shots.\n\nSublingual immunotherapy is an alternative and has become commonly used in Europe, where two tablet-based products against grass-pollen allergies are available: Grazax and Oralair. There are also a number of drop-based products. No sublingual immunotherapy products have yet been approved in the United States, however.\n\nFor the new study, reported in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Italian researchers combined the results of 19 clinical trials conducted since 1995 on the effectiveness of immunotherapy tablets and drops against hay fever caused by grass pollen.\n\nThe trials lasted anywhere from three months to three years.\n\nAcross the studies, which included a total of 2,971 adults and children with grass-pollen allergies, immunotherapy reduced symptoms by about 20 percent to 30 percent, on average. It also allowed patients to reduce their use of antihistamines and other medications.\n\nThe researchers, led by Dr. Gabriele Di Lorenzo of the University of Palermo, describe the benefits as \u201cmodest.\u201d\n\nIn an email, Di Lorenzo told Reuters Health that the findings suggest that sublingual immunotherapy is \u201chighly effective in many, but not in all patients.\u201d He said that more work is needed to identify which patients might be most likely to benefit.\n\nDr. Harold Nelson, an allergist at National Jewish Health in Denver, said that the body of evidence indicates that sublingual immunotherapy beats antihistamines and other medications used to control hay fever symptoms.\n\nIn an interview, he noted that antihistamines reduce symptoms by about 12 percent to 15 percent, on average. Nasal steroids, another hay fever option, appear to cut symptoms by about 17 percent.\n\nOn the other hand, Nelson said, allergy shots appear to outperform the oral versions, with a symptom reduction about twice that of sublingual immunotherapy.\n\nIn addition, the long-term effectiveness of the grass-pollen tablets is not yet fully clear.\n\nLike allergy shots, the oral immunotherapy takes time. Grazax, for instance, is taken daily, starting several months before the start of the next grass-pollen allergy season and continuing for three years thereafter.\n\nResearch so far suggests that the symptom relief persists in the year after patients stop taking Grazax. A study published earlier this year \u2014 and not included in the current analysis \u2014 found that during that post-treatment year, Grazax patients had one-quarter fewer hay fever symptoms than those who had been given a placebo for comparison.\n\nBut longer term data are not yet available. The benefits of allergy shots, by contrast, have been shown to persist for 10 years or beyond, Nelson noted.\n\nThe ultimate cost-effectiveness of sublingual immunotherapy has also yet to be determined; in the UK, for example, Grazax treatment costs about 2.25 pounds ($3.50) per day. In theory, that could pay off if long-term use of allergy medications was cut, but that has yet to be shown.\n\nStill, Nelson said that if sublingual products do win approval in the U.S., they will likely boost the number of hay fever sufferers who want to use under-the-tongue immunotherapy. Even though the effectiveness is less than that of allergy shots, the convenience of an at-home version of immunotherapy is a plus, and the sublingual therapy tends to have fewer side effects than shots, according to Nelson.\n\nThe most common side effects include itchiness and irritation in the mouth, ears and eyes, swelling of the mouth or tongue, headache and gastrointestinal problems like stomach pain and heartburn.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "1clip_filelist.xml\" rel=\"File-List\"/>1clip_themedata.thmx\" rel=\"themeData\"/>1clip_colorschememapping.xml\" rel=\"colorSchemeMapping\"/>\n\n\n\n \nThis story makes it clear that sublingual immunotherapy is not available in the U.S.; however, this might have been mentioned sooner in the text.\u00a0\u00a0 \n", "answer": 1}, {"article": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Fast food outlets should hand out free cholesterol-lowering statin drugs to their customers to \u201cneutralize\u201d the heart risks of eating fatty foods like burgers and fries, British scientists suggested on Thursday.\n\nBut a few experts say you might want to ask your server to hold the statin at this point.\n\nIn a study published in the American Journal of Cardiology, scientists from the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College London calculated that the reduction in heart disease risk offered by a statin could offset the increase in risk from eating a cheeseburger and a milkshake.\n\n\u201cStatins don\u2019t cut out all of the unhealthy effects of a burger and fries.

The FDA said the drug, called Januvia, is ``important\" because 70 percent of diabetes patients cannot adequately control their blood sugar using existing treatments. Januvia is expected to become a billion-dollar blockbuster treatment for its maker, & Co., and will be priced at $4.86 per tablet. Newly diagnosed patients can use the drug on its own, along with diet and exercise, to control blood sugar levels. And because it doesn't cause severe side effects when used in combination with popular diabetes drugs already on the market, Januvia also can be used by those whose disease is more advanced and requires more medicines. The drug leverages the body's natural ability to control blood sugar by producing more insulin and lowering glucose. Controlling blood sugar can help stave off the need for patients to take insulin. Diabetes affects about 21 million Americans and occurs when the body builds resistance to insulin needed to break down food, causing blood sugar levels to spike. About 95 percent of adults with diabetes have the Type 2 form. They either do not produce enough insulin or their bodies fail to use what is produced. Those with Type 1 diabetes must take insulin daily because their bodies do not produce any insulin. Unchecked diabetes can cause blindness , kidney failure , and heart ailments and can lead to amputations . The number of people with it is rising because of expanding waistlines and sedentary lifestyles, according to the National Institutes of Health. In clinical trials, Januvia did not have the side effects typical of older treatments, such as weight gain, and dangerous drops in blood sugar. The most commonly reported side effects in trials have been minor: runny noses, coughs, colds, sore throats, diarrhea and nausea. But some in the medical community fear that could change when millions begin to use the new drug. Analysts and physicians said Januvia offers a ``modest\" reduction in a key measurement to gauge how well a patient's blood sugar level is being controlled. Elevated values increase the risk for eye , kidney , nerve, and heart damage. A Boston man with Type 2 diabetes who has responded well to metformin, a generic treatment for diabetes, said he would use Januvia even if it only slightly improved his blood sugar value. ``I look at it as almost like a scale,\" said Marc Onigman , 56 . ``If the drug can help me keep that number dead-even, bring on the drug. As long as it doesn't have side effects that lay me out for a week.\" Januvia boosts insulin levels when blood sugar levels are high, but cuts off the supply ``when the blood sugar goes down to normal,\" said Dr. Edward Horton , director of clinical research at the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston . ``It's taking advantage of the body's own mechanism to respond to a meal.\" Because Januvia helps the body better manage insulin levels, he said, it is much less likely to cause hypoglycemia -- dangerously low blood sugar levels -- than older treatments. Horton, a Harvard Medical School professor of medicine , is a paid Merck consultant. The company has made him available for interviews about Januvia and has sponsored diabetes treatment sessions for doctors featuring him as a speaker. Januvia targets an enzyme that is involved in activating many of the body's hormones, which worries some doctors because studies of how it affects patients have been limited. FDA approval was based on studies involving 2,719 patients. Roughly 440 of them had taken Januvia longer than one year and only 160 had taken the drug for two years. ``The concern always has been that the regulation of some of those hormones may be very important in subsets of patients that we don't yet understand,\" said Dr. John Buse , director of the Diabetes Care Center at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill and president-elect of the American Diabetes Association . Because Januvia is the first drug approved in its class, it is not surprising that some people will approach it with caution, Buse said. ``There are many patients and, maybe, even more doctors who are relatively reluctant to use a new drug in the first six months or year after it's released,\" he said. Merck said it will conduct additional tests of Januvia in combination with insulin and another class of diabetes drugs. ``Type 2 diabetics use a variety of medications to control their condition,\" said Dr. Mary Parks , the director of the FDA's division of metabolism and endocrine products . ``We want as much information\" on the effectiveness and safety of Januvia taken in combination with other products, Parks said. Some 400 different treatments for diabetes are in development. Recent innovations include inhaled insulin, which eliminates the need for injections. research analyst Barbara Ryan , in a note to investors, called diabetes treatments ``hot, hot, hot\" with a market size capable of supporting ``multiple new blockbuster opportunities.\" AG is hot on the heels of Januvia with its own new-generation diabetes pill, Galvus , expected to receive FDA approval next month . By shipping Januvia quickly, Merck aims to take advantage of ``a short window before Galvus gets the green light,\" analyst Jami Rubin wrote in a research note. Rubin forecasts $350 million in Januvia sales worldwide in 2007 with $1.6 billion in sales by 2010 , a conservative estimate.

I was taken aback by their response. They basically laughed at the idea that the flu shot was particularly effective.\n\nThis posed a conundrum. It seemed like there were two groups saying very different things. But after reviewing the research, I think I understand what's going on here. It's true that flu vaccines don't work spectacularly well, at least according to the best evidence we have (and most of the evidence on flu vaccines is of poor methodological quality). But the downsides to getting a vaccine are extremely minimal, and flu shots may still be helpful in reducing some illness and saving lives, which is why public health experts say you should get vaccinated anyway.\n\nWhy the flu vaccine isn't always effective\n\nThe flu vaccine has been our main strategy for warding off seasonal flu for more than 60 years. Seasonal influenza, which surfaces as a respiratory illness, is caused by influenza A and B viruses. The flu shot is designed to protect people against three or four strains of the A and B viruses that researchers believe will be most common that year, leading to the nasty fevers, headaches, coughs, and runny noses that make many people miserable in the fall and winter.\n\nThe challenge, however, is that the flu virus is highly unstable, mutating all the time. So this means drug companies can't just make one kind of vaccine that'll last a lifetime. Every year, public health agencies essentially make educated guesses on what strains and mutations will make the rounds. And that's not easy. In February, the World Health Organization offers a prediction \u2014 based on surveillance and laboratory and clinical studies \u2014 and then each country uses that prediction to approve vaccines in its jurisdiction. (In the US, the Food and Drug Administration makes that final call.) The potential for error here can dramatically alter the effectiveness of the flu shot in a given season. If vaccine makers prepare for one combination of viruses and different ones end up circulating widely, the vaccine won't work that well.\n\nThis may help explain why the evidence on the effectiveness of flu shots is relatively mixed. The Cochrane Collaboration, an independent nonprofit that reviews the evidence on medical questions, has conducted two major meta-analyses (looking at the results of lots of individual studies) on whether the shot prevents flu in healthy children and adults.\n\nIn kids, the highest-quality evidence \u2014 a randomized controlled trial \u2014 suggests the vaccine works well enough: On average, if you give six kids under the age of 6 a flu shot, you can expect to prevent one case of the flu. For children under age 2, the benefits are less clear; the evidence, the researchers found, was scant, and of the research that was available, it seemed the efficacy of the shot was similar to placebo.\n\nIn adults, however, the vaccine's effects are more modest. \"Depending on the season,\" explained Tom Jefferson, an author on these Cochrane reviews, \"you need to vaccinate anywhere between 33 and 100 people to avoid one set of symptoms.\" In a good year, when the WHO guesses correctly and the flu shot matches the strains in circulation, you need to give 33 adults flu shots, on average, to prevent one case of illness. In a year when the WHO guesses badly, you need to vaccinate 100 people to prevent one flu case.\n\nJefferson pointed out that his Cochrane review on adults also found that flu vaccination rates have barely any effect on the number of sick days taken and no major impact on rates of hospitalization. So, yes, the flu vaccine can prevent illness, but it's hard to detect major effects on public health in the data.\n\nOn the other hand, the evidence suggests that there's no harm in getting a flu shot, either. The meta-analyses found no evidence of serious side effects beyond the odd case of soreness at the injection site.\n\nThat seems to be the same conclusion that other studies have drawn \u2014 the flu vaccine is modestly helpful, and doesn't hurt. In 2012 researchers analyzed 15 meta-analyses on the flu shot and concluded, \"Most influenza vaccines have been shown to confer some protection against naturally acquired infection and no evidence for major harms has emerged.\"\n\nOne key caveat here is that the evidence, overall, is pretty poor quality. Most of these analyses rely overwhelmingly on observational studies, where researchers observe and gather data on people who take the flu shot compared with those who don't. Because these aren't experiments \u2014 ideally we'd have randomized controlled trials \u2014 they're more prone to bias and therefore less reliable.\n\nIn the case of the elderly, the situation is particularly troublesome. As this Lancet study points out, because annual flu shots were recommended for the elderly since the 1960s, it has been unethical to conduct high-quality randomized controlled trials where you give only one group the shot in order to compare it with another group that didn't get the vaccine. So, as this Cochrane review notes, it's impossible to draw firm conclusions on the effectiveness of the flu vaccine for those over 65 because the data is so biased and poor.\n\nAgain, though, this doesn't mean we should throw away the vaccine. Stanford researcher John Ioannidis told me how he makes sense of this issue after reviewing the evidence: \"Overall the flu vaccine is effective, and it does save lives. I cannot put an exact figure to how many, but it may well be millions of lives. Generally it is safe and rather cheap, so even if the effectiveness is less than optimal sometimes, overall it is a good deal.\"\n\nWhy people still bother to get the shot\n\nDespite the limited evidence of effectiveness, there are still good reasons why public health experts recommend the shot.\n\nFor one, in those years when the WHO guesses correctly which strains will circulate, the shot tends to be a lot more helpful than some of these averages suggest. And the vaccine is overwhelmingly safe. There's also little by way of alternatives. Beyond public health measures (making sure you have good hand hygiene and avoiding the office when you're sick), the flu shot is the best medical intervention we have for preventing infection. So there's little downside with at least some potential benefit. I personally continue to get the flu shot for this reason.\n\nAs Roger Baxter, the co-director of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center, told me, \"Flu vaccines are not a panacea, and do not prevent all cases of flu, even in the best years, when there are no manufacturing problems and the match is perfect.\" He continued: \"However, the vaccines provide moderate protection, and can prevent huge numbers of cases of this serious illness. Many studies have shown that the vaccines are very safe, so the benefit-to-risk ratio is high and the cost is relatively low.\"\n\nWelcome to Dear Julia, a column where readers can submit everyday health questions.

We ask: Should you believe this?\n\nThe Claim: If you drink coffee you\u2019ll live forever! Well, almost: nurses and other health professionals who drink coffee (regular or decaf) had a lower risk of premature death than coffee abstainers.\n\nThe Backstory: . . . is enough to make STAT cross-eyed. Decades of studies have examined links between coffee drinking and health outcomes. Overall, the conclusions have been pro-coffee. Lots of research has linked coffee drinking to a lower risk of dying early, including this, this, and this. Other studies have found associations with lower risk of specific conditions, like this on cardiovascular disease (by many of the same authors as the new study), this on stroke, this on heart failure, and this on diabetes. Most research has found the greatest benefits with daily consumption of around three or four cups \u2014 usually 6 to 8 ounces, and without distinguishing regular from decaf. Fewer studies link coffee to a higher likelihood of dying prematurely, but this classic found a link between 6-plus cups a day and dying of cardiovascular disease, while this 2013 paper, on 43,727 people followed for a median of 17 years, concluded that adults under 55 who averaged more than 4 cups a week had a 56 percent (men) or 130 percent (women) higher risk of dying over the study period than non-coffee drinkers.\n\nFirst Take: The new research, published in Circulation on Monday and funded by the National Institutes of Health, mined three large, ongoing epidemiological studies (74,890 women in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, 93,054 women in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study 2, and 40,557 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study), following them for at least 20 years. Overall, the heaviest coffee-drinkers (more than five cups a day, regular or decaf) had a tiny 2 percent additional risk of dying compared with coffee abstainers. Those drinking 1.1 to 3 cups, and 3.1 to 5 cups, had slightly (9 percent and 7 percent) lower risks of dying.\n\nThen the researchers, led by Dr. Frank Hu of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, did something clever: they ran the analysis on nonsmokers only. That eliminated the stereotypical coffee-swilling, cigarette-sucking types. Result: people drinking 1.1 to 3 cups a day had an 8 percent lower mortality risk, while the 3.1-5-cup crowd had a 15 percent lower mortality risk, mostly due to lower risk of deaths from cardiovascular disease, neurological diseases, type 2 diabetes, and suicide. Even the 5-plus\u2019s had 12 percent lower mortality.\n\nA co-author of the 2013 study linking heavy coffee drinking to higher mortality called the new one \u201cvery good,\u201d especially since it controlled for the deadly effects of smoking, which the earlier one did not. It \u201csupports the safety and efficacy of even high doses of coffee in non-smokers,\u201d said Dr. Carl Lavie, a cardiologist at Ochsner Health System. But given the 2013 research suggesting \u201ctoxicity of high coffee doses\u201d in some people, he said, \u201cto me the most reasonable approach would be to keep coffee intake to two to three cups most days.\u201d\n\nSecond Take: STAT knows better than to get between coffee lovers and their cup o\u2019 joe, so if you want to take this study as permission to keep beating a path to your Keurig, we\u2019re not going to slow you down.\n\nThis is another observational study, where researchers look for associations between people\u2019s freely-chosen diet and other lifestyle decisions and subsequent health outcomes. Correlations do not establish causation: a link between Behavior A and Health Outcome B might or might not mean that A caused B. It might mean instead that a third factor \u2014 another behavior, socioeconomic status, even personality or genetics \u2014 might go hand in hand with Behavior A and be the true cause of Outcome B. Maybe people who drink coffee have some genetic, psychological, or behavioral trait (drinking fewer sugary beverages? eating less junk food?) that causes the observed benefit.\n\nBut surely the population in this study is so huge and socioeconomically similar (all health professionals) that correlation is more likely to reflect causation?\n\nMore likely, yes, but don\u2019t count on it. This same Nurses Health Study, for instance, infamously found a correlation between post-menopausal hormone therapy and lower risk of cardiovascular disease and death, here and here. That turned out to be wrong. The definitive, randomized Women\u2019s Health Initiative study showed that hormone therapy raised the risk of cardiovascular disease, contradicting the NHS and shocking nearly everyone.\n\nTakeaway: Observational studies that associate coffee drinking with health benefits are strongly suggestive but not definitive. If you do want to infer causation from this latest study, know that drinking coffee reduced the absolute mortality risk from 6.8 deaths a year per 1,000 people to, at best, 5.8. That is, each year, coffee would be keeping 1 person in 1,000 from dying.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Coffee is widely available, and that\u2019s obvious from the story.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "\u201cIt\u2019s promising that we can see an effect from a single dose,\u201d says researcher Leah Coles, PhD, a research fellow at the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne, Australia. \u201cThat effect might be even greater over the long term if they are drinking it day upon day.\u201d\n\nResearchers say that drop may seem small, but on a public health level a reduction like that would equate to a 10% reduction in deaths due to heart disease .\n\nThe study shows that within hours of drinking it, beet juice lowered systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) by an average of 4-5 points among a small group of healthy men .\n\nDec. 14, 2012 -- Drinking a glass of beet juice may have an immediate impact on lowering blood pressure , according to a new study.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that beet juice, also known as beetroot juice, can lower blood pressure in a laboratory setting.

The results were presented Monday at the Society of Interventional Radiology's annual meeting, in Los Angeles.\n\n\"Patients overall were able to improve their physical function in the knee after the procedure, and there were no adverse events related to this treatment,\" said lead researcher Dr. Sandeep Bagla.\n\nBagla is director of interventional radiology at the Vascular Institute of Virginia in Woodbridge. Boston Scientific, maker of the microparticles, funded the study.\n\nMuch of the pain that comes from knee arthritis actually stems from inflammation in the lining of the knee joint, also called the synovium, Bagla said. In fact, small blood vessels created by degenerative arthritis feed this inflammation by increasing blood flow to the lining.\n\nTo treat this, Bagla and his colleagues decided to try blocking those tiny blood vessels using microparticles -- spheres about a tenth of a millimeter in size made from a synthetic gel-like material.\n\nThe microparticles are inserted using a catheter run through a pinhole-sized incision, in a procedure that lasts between 45 and 90 minutes, Bagla said.\n\n\"It's an outpatient procedure, and no physical therapy is required before or after this procedure,\" he said.\n\nThe small pilot study -- the first U.S. clinical trial of this procedure -- involved 20 patients with moderate to severe arthritis pain. Only 13 had undergone the procedure by the time of Monday's annual meeting, and only eight had made it to the one-month follow-up, Bagla said.\n\nThose eight patients averaged a 58-point decrease in pain, as measured on a 100-point visual scale used to estimate pain, Bagla said. They started with an average baseline of 72, which means their pain was brought down to manageable levels, he said.\n\nPhysical function of their knee also improved, based on an index used to judge the effects of osteoarthritis, Bagla added.\n\nOverall, the two scales represented an 80 percent improvement in function, the researchers concluded.\n\nBagla said no side effects are expected because the procedure only blocks additional blood flow to the knee, rather than cutting it off altogether.\n\n\"You don't normally have this degree of increased blood supply to this lining. We're not blocking normal blood vessels to the knee or leg or bone or cartilage,\" he said.\n\nFinal results from this clinical trial are expected to be released this summer. Researchers are already kicking off a second, larger trial to better understand how the procedure works and which patients it might benefit, Bagla said.\n\nThey think it will be most appropriate for people between ages 40 and 70 who aren't ready to go through knee replacement, or people who are on chronic pain medication for their knee arthritis, Bagla said.\n\n\"Perhaps we can demonstrate and prove patients do not need to be on these medications and can alternatively go through a minimally invasive procedure like this to reduce their knee pain,\" Bagla said.\n\nDr. Suresh Vedantham, president of the Society of Interventional Radiology, called the new procedure \"very promising,\" given that it focuses on the inflamed knee lining that causes the pain.\n\n\"This therapy is very well-targeted to that particular mechanism, and certainly it should be investigated further,\" said Vedantham, who wasn't involved with the study.

Doctors can begin treatment immediately, trying to save the most important organ in the body. The brain, however, is also vulnerable to many more, much less visible ailments.\n\nConsider the case of Allie Orlando, a 23-year-old social service coordinator, who has received a plethora of diagnoses since she first saw a psychologist at 14. First, it was generalized anxiety disorder. Next, she was told she had depression. Then, when she was 17, it was settled: She suffered from borderline personality disorder. But when Orlando traveled out of state for college, she began seeing a new psychologist who strongly disagreed with her borderline diagnosis. Meanwhile, she continued to struggle and entered the hospital for suicidal ideation her sophomore year. The doctors there agreed: Borderline wasn\u2019t the right diagnosis, and maybe she should stop taking the meds she had been prescribed.\n\n\u201cI was just frustrated because the stigma attached to borderline is very strong,\u201d Orlando says. She had been open about her diagnosis in high school, but felt the \u201cborderline\u201d label may have scared some people off. She recalled her boyfriend at the time searching the web for her diagnosis and saying: \u201cOh God, no.\u201d After that, she kept quiet about her diagnosis, worried it would drive friends away. \u201cI\u2019m sure it also affected what meds I was prescribed. It took a few years to find the right \u2018formula\u2019 of meds.\u201d While the doctors recommended some medication that helped, it was a matter of trial and error, since Orlando still doesn\u2019t have a concrete diagnosis today.\n\nThe problem is that mental health diagnosis has essentially remained unchanged for 100 years, relying on symptoms and clinical interviews. Mental disorders lack what most other health diagnoses rely on: biological markers. A tumor seen on a scan, bacteria identified by a throat culture, a fracture captured on an X-ray: They\u2019re all clear signs something is wrong. Mental health disorders are difficult to diagnose even by the most well-trained, well-meaning psychiatrists, because all they have to go on are questions and, sometimes, answers. \u201cDiagnosis is really asking lots and lots of questions about their [patients\u2019] experience, looking at patients\u2019 answers both from what they say and how they say it,\u201d says Dr. Michael Dulchin, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the New York University Medical Center. The uncertainty can lead to dangerous misdiagnoses.\n\nWithout such signs to confirm their diagnosis, patients with mental illnesses are often burdened by the perception that they somehow have something less \u201creal\u201d than most other ailments. For years, researchers searched, in vain, for concrete signs in the brain that could tell them the difference between, for example, bipolar and depression. Now some believe the key may be realizing that mental illnesses are not necessarily contained in the brain: Biomarkers may be found throughout the entire body.\n\nDr. Sabine Bahn, a professor of neurotechnology at Cambridge University, leads a team researching this premise. As a Ph.D. student, she investigated the postmortem brains of psychiatric patients and was surprised to find differences in glucose regulation processes and certain parts of cell production in the brains of schizophrenia patients.\n\nBahn\u2019s team then looked at the cerebrospinal fluid of early-stage schizophrenia patients who had not yet taken any medication and again saw abnormalities in glucose handling. Bahn says it was a revelation that such changes could be spotted in the blood of patients in such early stages of the disease. What if, her team began to think, it could come up with a blood test for schizophrenia? Having this kind of tool would be invaluable\u2014with the current interview-based methods of diagnosis, subtle symptoms of schizophrenia are missed until too late, delaying treatment by months, or even years.\n\nArmed with her previous research, Bahn and her team detailed a panel of blood biomarkers in individuals who have an increased risk of schizophrenia but have no visible symptoms yet. The test, says Bahn, can accurately predict whether someone will \u201cdevelop schizophrenia over the next two years.\u201d\n\nBahn\u2019s finding is one of several recent advancements toward a comprehensive system of biological mental health diagnostic tools. One group of researchers, for example, recently worked backward to take on the problematic overlap between depression and bipolar disorder\u2014many bipolar patients are initially and incorrectly diagnosed with depression. The team took urine samples from patients who had been diagnosed with one of the two disorders and looked for differences between the two groups. The results, published in the Journal of Proteome Research, showed that 20 different metabolites differentiated the two groups. Another team of scientists identified differences in the throat bacteria of schizophrenic and healthy people. Previous research had suggested tentative links between immune disorders, which are influenced in part by microbes in the body, and schizophrenia; the new study, published in PeerJ, furthered the possibility that differences in oral bacteria could be associated with the disorder.\n\nDespite these exciting preliminary findings, there aren\u2019t yet any biological tests for mental illness widely used in medical practice. In some cases, the reason is primarily financial. \u201cThe problem with schizophrenia is that although about 1 percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia, the number of new patients per year is quite low, at 0.02 percent,\u201d says Bahn. \u201cAs the development costs of a test are very high, there is a risk that the test will not be commercially viable.\u201d For severe mental illnesses like schizophrenia, it\u2019s also the case that even if a test made it through development and hit the market, it may not be successfully integrated into psychiatric practice. That\u2019s because, Dulchin says, if a patient comes in with schizophrenia symptoms that a doctor knows can be alleviated with drugs, the doctor is not likely to deny that patient treatment\u2014no matter what a biological test says.\n\nThose working on these sorts of tests see them being implemented in a different setting entirely: when a patient comes into their internist seeking treatment for other conditions. \u201cPsychiatric disorders often present with other diseases such as diabetes and some immune disorders,\u201d says Bahn. If there was a blood test for depression, it could just become part of a standard panel\u2014and thus help achieve earlier diagnoses, and in turn earlier treatment, across the board.\n\nBut, if biological tests for mental illness do come to fruition, even those already living with a condition could benefit. \u201cI think if this biological aspect was attached to it, then people would see that stigmatizing someone for their depression is as ridiculous as stigmatizing someone for their diabetes,\u201d Orlando says. \u201cPeople often need concrete, tangible facts, and that\u2019s what scares them about mental illness and what causes the stigmatization\u2014they just don\u2019t understand it.\u201d", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story goes into some detail about how experimental these diagnostic tests are and even some of the difficulties entailed in bringing them to market.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The first year results, which are published today in The Lancet, also revealed that almost nine out of 10 people (86%) who lost 15kg or more put their Type 2 diabetes into remission. The study led by Professor Roy Taylor, from Newcastle University, and Professor Mike lean from Glasgow University, found that 45.6% of those who were put on a low calorie diet for three to five months and were able to stop their Type 2 diabetes medications. Importantly, long-term support by routine General Practice staff was given to help the paticipants maintain their weight loss. The trial, called DiRECT (Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial) and funded by Diabetes UK, recruited 298 people between the Newcastle and Glasgow University and builds on Professor Taylor\u2019s earlier pilot work. Professor Taylor, lead researcher of the DiRECT trial, said: \u201cThese findings are very exciting. They could revolutionise the way Type 2 diabetes is treated. \u201cThe study builds on the work into the underlying cause of the condition, so that we can target management effectively. \u201cSubstantial weight loss results in reduced fat inside the liver and pancreas, allowing these organs to return to normal function. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing from DiRECT is that losing weight isn\u2019t just linked to better management of Type 2 diabetes: significant weight loss could actually result in lasting remission.\"\n\nRemission was defined as having blood glucose levels (HbA1c) of less than 6.5% (48mmol/mol) at 12 months, with at least two months without any Type 2 diabetes medications. Of the 298 people recruited to take part in DiRECT, half received standard diabetes care from their GP, whilst the other half received a structured weight management programme within primary care. The programme included a low calorie, nutrient-complete diet for three to five months, food reintroduction and long-term support to maintain weight loss. Type 2 diabetes remission was found to be closely related to weight loss. Over half (57%) of those who lost 10 to 15kg achieved remission, along with a third (34%) of those who lost five to 10kg. Only 4% of the control group achieved remission. The findings have been presented at the International Diabetes Federation Congress in Abu Dhabi today by the lead researchers, Professor Taylor and Professor Mike Lean. Professor Lean said: \u201cPutting Type 2 diabetes into remission as early as possible after diagnosis could have extraordinary benefits, both for the individual and the NHS. DiRECT is telling us it could be possible for as many as half of patients to achieve this in routine primary care, and without drugs. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that people were really interested in this approach \u2013 almost a third of those who were asked to take part in the study agreed. This is much higher than usual acceptance rates for diabetes clinical trials.\"\n\nDiRECT is a two-year trial which aims to find an effective and accessible way to put Type 2 diabetes into remission for the long-term. The trial is delivered through GP practices across Tyneside and Scotland to find out if the benefits of a structured weight management programme can be felt in a real-life primary care setting. DiRECT also aims to understand why significant weight loss results in remission, to understand which groups might benefit in the future. Type 2 diabetes is a life-changing condition that progresses over time, which can have devastating consequences. Finding ways to put it into lasting remission could significantly reduce the cost of delivering diabetes care and treating serious complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney disease or stroke. Remission could transform the lives of millions of people living with or at risk of Type 2 diabetes. Isobel Murray, 65, from North Ayrshire, took part in DiRECT from 2014 to 2016. She was on the low calorie diet programme for 17 weeks and put her Type 2 diabetes into remission after the first four months. Over the two year trial, Isobel lost more than three and a half stone and no longer needs to take any diabetes medication.

I am one of the lucky ones to have gone into remission.\u201d Diabetes UK has committed more than \u00a32.8 million to the DiRECT study. Recently, \u00a3300,000 has been committed so participants who wish to continue can be followed for up to three years and the full cost-effectiveness of this programme can be evaluated. The funding will provide further understanding around the longer term benefits, to see if a treatment of this kind could be offered to people with Type 2 diabetes in the future. Dr Elizabeth Robertson, Director of Research at Diabetes UK, said: \u201cThese first year findings of DiRECT demonstrate the potential to transform the lives of millions of people. \u201cWe\u2019re very encouraged by these initial results, and the building robust evidence that remission could be achievable for some people. \u201cThe trial is ongoing, so that we can understand the long-term effects of an approach like this. It\u2019s very important that anyone living with Type 2 diabetes considering losing weight in this way seeks support and advice from a healthcare professional.\u201d Whether putting Type 2 diabetes into remission can protect against diabetes-related complications later in life is not yet known, which is why it is important that those who achieve remission continue to receive health checks.

In contrast, of study participants who were assigned to a wait-list for therapy, none showed a similar decline in pain.\n\nFibromyalgia is a syndrome marked by widespread pain \u2014 including discomfort at specific \u201ctender points\u201d in the body \u2014 along with symptoms such as fatigue, irritable bowel and sleep problems. It is estimated to affect up to 5 million U.S. adults, most commonly middle-aged women.\n\nThe precise cause of fibromyalgia is unknown \u2014 there are no physical signs, such as inflammation and tissue damage in the painful area \u2014 but some researchers believe the disorder involves problems in how the brain processes pain signals.\n\nStandard treatments include painkillers, antidepressants, cognitive- behavioral therapy and exercise therapy. However, many people with fibromyalgia find that their symptoms \u2014 pain, in particular \u2014 persist despite treatment.\n\nPart of that, according to the researchers on the new study, may be because standard treatments do not specifically address the role psychological stress and emotions can play in triggering people\u2019s pain.\n\nThat is not to say that the pain people with fibromyalgia feel is \u201call in their head,\u201d stressed Dr. Howard Schubiner, of St. John Health/ Providence Hospital and Medical Centers in Southfield, Michigan.\n\n\u201cThe pain is very real,\u201d Schubiner said in an interview. But, he explained, pain and emotions are \u201cconnected in the brain,\u201d and emotional factors may act to trigger \u201clearned nerve pathways\u201d that give rise to pain.\n\nPast studies have found that compared with people without fibromyalgia, those with the disorder have higher rates of stressful life events, such as childhood abuse, marital problems and high levels of job stress. There is also evidence that they are relatively less aware of their own emotions and more reluctant to express their feelings, particularly anger.\n\nFor the new study, published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, Schubiner and his colleagues tested the effects of affective self-awareness \u2014 a technique Schubiner developed and uses in treating certain chronic-pain conditions \u2014 on fibromyalgia.\n\nThey randomly assigned 45 women with the condition to either undergo the therapy or go on a wait-list for treatment, serving as a control group. Women in the treatment group each had a one-on-one consultation, then attended three group meetings to learn the affective self-awareness techniques so that they could carry them out on their own.\n\nThe therapy involves an educational component where patients learn about the emotion-pain connection. They learn specific techniques \u2014 including mindfulness meditation and \u201cexpressive\u201d writing \u2014 for recognizing and dealing with the emotions that may be contributing to their pain. Patients are also encouraged to get back to any exercise or other activities that they have been avoiding due to pain.\n\nSchubiner\u2019s team found that six months later, 46 percent of the treatment group had at least a 30-percent reduction in their pain ratings compared with scores at the outset. And 21 percent had a 50-percent or greater reduction.\n\nNone of the women in the control group had a comparable improvement.\n\nThe study is only the first clinical trial to test affective self-awareness for fibromyalgia, and it had a number of limitations, including its small size. In addition, the control group received no active therapy to serve as a comparison.\n\nThat is important because it is possible for patients to benefit from simply receiving attention from a healthcare provider, or being part of small-group sessions with other people suffering from the same condition, for example.\n\nSchubiner also acknowledged that this general \u201cmodel\u201d for understanding and addressing fibromyalgia pain is controversial.\n\nHe said that he and his colleagues have applied for funding to conduct a larger clinical trial comparing affective self-awareness with standard cognitive-behavioral therapy.\n\nAffective self-awareness and cognitive-behavioral therapy have similarities, according to Schubiner. Both, for example, try to show patients that they have the power to improve their own health.\n\nA key difference, Schubiner said, is that affective self-awareness asks people to \u201cdirectly engage\u201d the emotions that may be helping to drive their symptoms.\n\nAnother difference is that, right now, only a small number of healthcare providers practice affective self-awareness, according to Schubiner.\n\nSome components of the technique, such as teachings in mindfulness meditation, are more widely available.

If the experimental medication is eventually approved for use, it would be only the second oral MS drug available to patients, alongside a number of long-standing injectable options.\n\n\"The injectables aren't going to go away,\" commented Dr. Scott S. Zamvil, a professor of neurology and faculty member in the program in immunology at the University of California, San Francisco. \"We went 17 years with injectables before we got our first oral option, 'Gilenya', just last year. But there's a lot of excitement about this new option and these results, because even though the injectables are safe and effective in terms of convenience and patient compliance, oral drugs are much better than shots.\"\n\n\"And with the one oral option we have today, there has been a lot of concern over a possible risk for immune suppression and also an increased risk for cancer,\" added Zamvil, who was not a part of the current study team. \"That does not seem to be the case with this new drug. So this appears to be a significant advance forward.\"\n\nThe current research was funded by Teva Pharmaceuticals, the maker of laquinimod.\n\nThe lead study author is Dr. Giancarlo Comi, director of the department of neurology and the Institute of Experimental Neurology at the Scientific Institute and University Vita-Salute San Raffaele in Milan, Italy. He is slated to present his team's findings this week in Honolulu at the American Academy of Neurology meeting.\n\nIn the two-year, double-blind Phase III trial, participants were randomly divided into two groups: those who were given a daily dose of laquinimod (0.6 milligrams) and those who were given a sugar-pill (placebo); neither the researchers nor the participants knew who received the medication or the placebo.\n\nThe annual rate of MS relapse was 23 percent lower in the laquinimod group compared with the placebo group.\n\nIn addition, disability progression was reduced by 36 percent and brain atrophy by 33 percent compared with those getting the sham treatment.\n\nAdverse events, including serious events, were comparable to those in the placebo group, according to the researchers. The incidence of liver enzyme elevation was higher in patients treated with laquinimod, according to Comi, but he added that the elevations were temporary, reversible and did not lead to any signs of liver problems.\n\nLaquinimod was not, however, tested against currently existing treatment alternatives, the authors stressed. The team added that the new medication appears to tackle MS by a different type of mechanism than other available options, and apparently works by curtailing the onset of permanent tissue damage while limiting acute inflammation.\n\n\"Each of the medications we have has a different mechanism of action,\" explained Dr. Gary Birnbaum, director of the MS Treatment and Research Center at the Minneapolis Clinic of Neurology. \"And MS is probably not a single disease. So different medications may work better for some and not others, which is why this new drug could end up being an important addition to the armamentarium.\"\n\n\"However, we still need to have a head-to-head comparison with other drugs,\" cautioned Birnbaum, who was not part of the study team. \"This is not that. And it's also important to note that this is not a cure. It achieved a reduction in the annualized relapse rate, and people on this medication did not have as many attacks per year as people on a placebo. But a 23 percent reduction is not a cure.

But another from the United States gives more weight to findings from Africa that show the procedure, when it's performed on adult men, makes a major difference in preventing such diseases as AIDS.\n\nThe findings come as the American Academy of Pediatrics debates updating its recommendations regarding circumcision among newborns. The academy now takes a neutral stance.\n\nIn general, \"there is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the risks and benefits of circumcision,\" said Dr. Douglas S. Diekema, a pediatrician at the University of Washington who's familiar with both reviews and serves on a task force working on the academy's recommendations.\n\n\"There are some clear benefits to circumcision,\" he said. \"There are some risks to circumcision, although the significant ones appear to be rare.\"\n\nNot so, write the Australian researchers, who examined eight studies for a review in the latest issue of the Annals of Family Medicine. Two studies involved neonatal circumcision, and six involved older males, roughly 14 to 49 years old.\n\nThe review's lead author, researcher Caryn Perera of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, said the risk of major complications ranges from 2 percent to 10 percent. \"These may be considered unacceptable for an elective procedure,\" she said.\n\nParents who think circumcision has medical benefits should be aware that there's \"a lack of consensus and robust evidence\" on that, she added.\n\nThough African studies have linked circumcision in adult men to lower rates of sexually transmitted diseases, including the virus that causes AIDS, Perera said that only future studies will tell if those findings are applicable to the Western world, where AIDS is much less prevalent.\n\nAnd there's more to consider, Perera said. She said that circumcision poses problems from a mental point of view, potentially causing \"significant anger or feeling incomplete, hurt, frustrated, abnormal or violated.\"\n\nAs to whether circumcision reduces sexual sensitivity, Perera said there's no evidence that it affects sensation when performed on adults. The highest-quality studies, known as randomized controlled trials, don't report whether infant circumcision affects sensation, she said.\n\nA review in the January issue of Archives of Pediatrics & and Adolescent Medicine, which examined three studies, took a different tack. It says that risks of complications from circumcision are less than 1 percent, and \"serious long-term complications are extremely rare.\"\n\nDr. Matthew Golden, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Washington Center for AIDS and STD, said the ideal study would randomly assign thousands of infants to either get circumcised or not get circumcised and then follow them for decades. But \"that trial is never getting done, nor should it be done,\" Golden said.\n\nFor now, he said, when it comes to circumcision, \"we know it's pretty safe, and we have a lot of evidence for some benefit.\"\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics has more on circumcision.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "", "answer": 2}, {"article": "Spring has barely sprung, but in most of the country, spring allergy season \u2014 triggered by the first stirrings of tree pollen \u2014 is well under way.\n\nYou can tell by the sniffles and sneezes of the afflicted. But you can also tell by the ads: TV spots selling remedies for drippy, congested noses, itchy eyes and other symptoms are in heavy rotation.\n\nNew this year: ads for Flonase, a nasal steroid spray from GlaxoSmithKline that just became available over the counter. It joins Sanofi's Nasacort, a spray in the same class that went from prescription to over-the-counter status a year ago. And they both sit on store shelves next to antihistamines such as Claritin, Allegra and Zyrtec that were prescription drugs just a few years ago. Older over-the-counter antihistamines, such as Benadryl, and decongestants, such as Sudafed and Afrin, remain available as well.\n\nDon't expect the ads to help you sort out what might work best for you. Here's what some top allergists say you need to know about these non-prescription options.\n\nBelieve (some of) the hype about the newly-accessible steroid nasal sprays.\n\nThese drugs work by fighting inflammation and they are in the \"single most effective drug class\" for treating nasal allergies, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Other expert groups have made similar statements. \"These are first-line treatments\" that can prevent allergy symptoms, not just treat them, says Jackie Eghrari-Sabet, an allergist in Gaithersburg, Md.\n\nBut that does not mean they work for everyone, says James Sublett, a Louisville allergist and president of the allergy group. People with mild to moderate symptoms have the best chance of full relief, he says.\n\nPossible side effects include nasal irritation and nose bleeds. Labels caution that some children using the sprays may experience slower growth, so a doctor should be consulted if a child needs them for more than two months.\n\nWhen prescription drugs are first available over the counter, most consumers end up paying more, because their insurers no longer cover the cost. The non-prescription steroid nasal sprays are selling for about $17 to $23 for a one-month supply (at the typical two-squirts per nostril adult starting dose). Worth knowing: so far, insurers have continued to pay for similar prescription sprays, Eghrari-Sabet says. The various sprays have never been studied head to head, so it's impossible to say whether they vary in effectiveness, she says.\n\nThere's a right way to use these sprays.\n\nThey should be used daily during your vulnerable season or seasons, ideally starting before symptoms do, Eghrari-Sabet says. The idea is \"to turn an army of inflammatory cells around before they recruit more soldiers,\" she says.\n\nIt's also important to administer the sprays correctly, so that they end up inside your nasal passages, not just your nose, where they might cause irritation, Sublett says. Packages contain instructions, and Sublett has an added tip: bend over and look at your toes while holding the bottle up and squirting.\n\nThese drugs target histamine. That's a chemical your body releases, causing sneezing, a runny nose and itchy eyes, when you come in contact with allergy-triggering substances. Antihistamines work faster than the steroid sprays, which can take a week or so to reach full effectiveness. They also can be cheaper, because they are available in store-brand versions. For example, Walmart sells Equate loratadine tablets (the same active ingredient as Claritin) for about $7 for 60 24-hour doses\n\nAntihistamines make perfect sense for someone who suffers a few sneezy days each season and doesn't want to use a spray for weeks or months, Eghrari-Sabet says. Look for one that does not make you sleepy, Sublett says. It's a myth, he adds, that older, sedating antihistamines, such as Benadryl, are extra effective against nasal allergies.\n\nDecongestants such as Sudafed work by shrinking swollen blood vessels in the nose. They can raise blood pressure and cause jitters, and some people are more susceptible than others. Some decongestant sprays such as Afrin \u2014 unlike the steroid nasal sprays \u2014 can be used for just few days at a time, because they otherwise cause rebound symptoms.\n\nSo use these medications sparingly, Sublett says.\n\nKeep your medical providers in the loop.\n\nOver-the-counter treatments should not take the place of professional care \u2014 especially if you have never been formally diagnosed with allergies, if you have additional medical problems or if your symptoms persist or worsen, Eghrari-Sabet and Sublett say. An allergist can test you to find out what's causing your symptoms and offer additional treatments. Those include allergy shots and, for a few patients who qualify, newer immunotherapy pills that desensitize people to grass and ragweed pollens.\n\nAlso important to remember: While medications can be helpful, the first rule of allergy control is to avoid the substances that make you sniffle and sneeze. If you are allergic to mold spores or to pollen from trees, grasses or ragweed, that means knowing when levels are high (by checking pollen.com or the National Allergy Bureau) and then taking steps such as these recommended by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and & Immunology:\n\u2022 Keep windows closed at home and in your car.\n\u2022 Use air conditioning if possible.\n\u2022 Try to stay indoors, and avoid mowing lawns or raking leaves.\n\u2022 If you need to be outside for a long period, wear a pollen mask.\n\u2022 After time outside, take a shower, shampoo your hair and change clothes.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "All these drugs are available over the counter, which the article mentions early in the story.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Alex Pierce, 25, took up distance running with great enthusiasm a couple of years ago. Then she developed knee pain so severe that she could not climb stairs.\n\nSo Pierce, a doctoral student in food science, went to see physical therapist Matt Briggs at The Ohio State Wexner Medical Center in Columbus. He performed deep massages, suggested changes in her running form and taught her how to exercise her thigh and gluteal muscles to better protect her knees. She believes all of that helped.\n\nBut Pierce, like a growing number of patients, had another treatment she is convinced helped even more. It\u2019s called \"dry needling,\" and it involves the insertion of thin, non-medicated solid needles into muscles or connective tissues. Proponents say it can reduce pain and improve movement. Pierce has had the procedure more than half a dozen times and believes it is one reason she will be able to run her fourth marathon in November.\n\n\u201cThis has kind of changed my life,\u201d she says.\n\nTestimonials like that are a big reason dry needling has caught on with some physical therapists, athletes and other patients, Briggs says. But testimonials are not scientific proof.\n\nAnd there, Briggs says, is where dry needling is lacking. While some studies have shown promise, he says, \u201cthe quality of the evidence is not strong.\u201d That\u2019s why Briggs and his colleagues are starting a study looking at dry needling in \u201crunner\u2019s knee,\u201d the condition that has plagued Pierce. Their goal, and the goal of other researchers now looking at dry needling, is to produce results rigorous enough to show whether it really works.\n\nFor now, here\u2019s what consumers should know:\n\nPhysical therapists say it is not, \u201cthough superficially, it may look the same,\u201d says Justin Elliott, vice president of government affairs for the American Physical Therapy Association. For one thing, he says, dry needling as performed by a physical therapist is not rooted in ancient Chinese medicine \u2014 there\u2019s no talk about redirecting the body\u2019s energy flow by placing needles at certain points in the body. Instead, needles are placed directly in problem areas.\n\nElliott says dry needling also is practiced by some chiropractors, naturopathic physicians and nurses, which puts it outside the realm of any one specialty.\n\nAcupuncturists beg to differ. \u201cWhat is being called dry needling is clearly a form of acupuncture\u201d and should be done only by professionals extensively trained in that discipline, says Thomas Burgoon, a West Chester, Pa., physician who is president of the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture. He says many acupuncturists do exactly what the physical therapists describe, with the same kind of needles.\n\nBurgoon\u2019s group has persuaded some states to bar physical therapists from the practice. \n\n\n\nHow might it work?\n\nOne theory is that the needles cause tight muscles to twitch, then relax. The needles may also increase blood flow or set off nerve responses that alter pain perception, Briggs says.\n\nAnother possibility: It\u2019s a placebo effect, an improvement triggered by the expectation that a treatment will work rather than by the treatment itself. To look for that possibility, the Ohio State study will compare patients who get the real needle treatment to those poked with sham needles that don\u2019t pierce the skin.\n\nMark Crislip, an infectious-disease doctor in Portland, Ore., who recently wrote about dry needling for Science-Based Medicine \u2014 a website critical of alternative medicine \u2014 says the version practiced by physical therapists doesn\u2019t \u201ccome with the mystical baggage that accompanies acupuncture.\u201d But he says it may well be a \u201ctheatrical placebo.\u201d\n\nWhat do published studies say?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mixed bag,\u201d Elliott says. In a 2011 review, the physical therapy association rated the evidence for dry needling a 3 out of 5, based on the best studies. A formal analysis of 35 trails on acupuncture and dry needling for chronic lower back pain was published by the Cochrane research group in 2005. It found they \u201cmay be useful\u201d additions to standard treatment. But it said higher quality studies were needed.\n\nWhat are the risks?\n\nNeedling can produce minor bleeding and some soreness, but in trained hands, and with the use of sterile needles and gloves, \u201cit\u2019s a very safe procedure,\u201d Briggs says.\n\nIn rare cases, deep needling can lead to a punctured lung or injuries to nerves and blood vessels, and acupuncturists fear non-specialists will be more likely to make such mistakes, Burgoon says.\n\nWill insurers pay for this?\n\nMany will not. Charges for patients can range from $10 to $75 per session, says Edo Zylstra, CEO of KinetaCore, a company that offers intensive three-day weekend courses in dry needling to physical therapists.\n\nDo all physical therapists offer this?\n\nNo. The physical therapy association tells members in seven states to steer clear because of recent court or regulatory decisions or language in existing licensing laws. They are: California, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, New York, South Dakota and Washington.\n\nAnd most of the nation\u2019s 200,000 licensed physical therapists are not trained in the technique.

They also believe improved diets have significantly cut diabetes and heart disease, and even slightly trimmed cancer cases.\n\nThe findings paint a surprising picture of American health. But study author Dong Wang, a graduate student with the departments of nutrition and epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, cautioned that it's not time to declare victory in the battle against unhealthy eating.\n\n\"The overall American diet is still poor,\" he said. \"Huge room exists for further improvement.\"\n\nThe researchers wanted to understand how changes in the American diet in the 21st century affected health over time. To get insight into the answer, they analyzed the results of seven health and nutrition surveys including almost 34,000 adults aged 20 and older between 1999 and 2012.\n\nThe researchers ranked diets on a healthy eating scale from 0 (poor diet) to 110 (perfect diet). From 1999 to 2012, the overall rating increased, from 40 to 48.\n\nOn the positive side, over time, Americans ate more fruit, whole grains, nuts and legumes and polyunsaturated fatty acids, Wang said. They also ate less trans fats, sugar-sweetened beverages and juice, and red and processed meat. But the intake of salt actually went up.\n\nThe researchers extrapolated their findings and estimated that the improvement in diets prevented over one million premature deaths and lowered heart disease cases by almost 9 percent, type 2 diabetes cases by nearly 13 percent and cancer cases by just over 1 percent.\n\nAccording to Wang, the study findings suggest that healthier diets lower the risk of death in a variety of ways. Among other things, improved diets appear to lower the risk of chronic diseases and boost the survival of people who have those conditions. Even a year or two of a better diet appears to have the power to affect survival rates, he said.\n\nThe study authors didn't analyze whether their estimates match up to actual death rates in the United States. But other research has pinpointed a decline in death rates in this century, Wang said.\n\nDr. Sonia Anand, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, praised the study, saying it's \"reasonable\" to link changes in diet to death rates in this way. But, she said, nutrition research like this has limitations because it relies on people's memories of what they ate. As a result, she said, it's crucial to look at a variety of studies and see if trends hold up.\n\nAccording to study author Wang, trans fats have been almost eliminated from the food supply, so what is needed next is more taxation on sugary drinks and more regulations requiring salt to be reduced in food.\n\nHe also said the government can do more to improve diets for the poor, who haven't seen the same level of improvements as other groups.

Flublok is the only flu vaccine made in a 100% egg-free system using modern cell culture technology, making it unnecessary to use an infectious influenza virus, antibiotics or harsh chemicals (e.g., formaldehyde) in manufacturing. Flublok is highly purified and does not contain any preservatives (e.g., thimerosal - a form of mercury), egg proteins, gelatin or latex. In addition, Flublok contains three times more antigen than traditional flu vaccines (3x45mcg hemagglutinin protein versus 3x15mcg hemagglutinin protein). In a 2014/15 post-marketing study of 9,000 adults 50 years and older, people who received Flublok were over 40% less likely to develop cell culture confirmed influenza than people who received a traditional flu vaccine. Flublok is an exact copy of the influenza virus coat protein and is not subject to the egg-adapted mutations associated with low vaccine effectiveness (see Skowronski et al. (2014) PLOS ONE 9(3), e92153).\n\nHealthcare professionals in the U.S. wishing to order Flublok should contact one of the following distributors:\n\nLearn more at www.proteinsciences.com and www.flublok.com.\n\nFlublok Safety Information \n\nFlublok is approved for people 18 and older to prevent influenza disease. The most common side effect from Flublok is pain at the site of injection. Headache, fatigue or muscle ache may occur. Tell the doctor if you have ever experienced Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (severe muscle weakness) or have had a severe allergic reaction to any component of Flublok vaccine. Vaccination with Flublok may not protect all individuals.

Then it fell out of favor.\n\nToday, the most common reason for the surgery is \"sleep disordered breathing,\" a broad diagnosis that includes sleep apnea and snoring. About 10 percent of elementary-school-age children snore.\n\nDoctors say snoring can cause bed-wetting, behavior problems, short stature and poor school performance. That's a far cry from the 1950s and '60s, when tonsillectomy was used to fight frequent sore throats.\n\nBack then, it was the most popular surgery in the United States. In the 1960s sitcom Leave It to Beaver, Beaver Cleaver was so impressed by his dad's tales of ice cream and pretty nurses that he schemed to have his tonsils out, even though he didn't need it.\n\nThe tonsils are two glands that sit at the base of the tongue and are part of the body's immune system. The premise of tonsillectomies, back in their heyday, was that tonsils get infected themselves and no longer help fend off germs.\n\nThen doctors started noticing that kids were still getting sore throats, even after having their tonsils taken out. But it wasn't until clinical trials were completed in the early 1980s that there was proof that tonsillectomy really only helped children with severe, recurrent throat infections.\n\n\"It was becoming unacceptable to just take tonsils out because they were there or you had a few infections,\" says Richard Rosenfeld, an ear, nose and throat doctor at SUNY Downstate in Brooklyn, N.Y. \"People were growing up with their tonsils.\"\n\nBut growing up with tonsils can create another problem: snoring. Lisa Moran of Takoma Park, Md., remembers what it sounded like when her son ,Tyler Scorza, now age 7, slept.\n\n\"It was loud,\" Moran says. \"You could hear him through he closed door, down the hall, snoring, and he would occasionally stop breathing.\"\n\nAt first, Tyler's pediatrician thought he'd outgrow the snoring. But he wasn't sleeping well and often didn't have any energy. The doctor recommended a head X-Ray, and the radiologist said that though Tyler's adenoids were enlarged, they weren't that bad.\n\nBy then, Tyler had been dealing with this for almost three years. He started getting frequent nasal infections. So his parents took him to an ear, nose and throat doctor. He said, sure, the adenoids are swollen.\n\n\"But the real problem is the tonsils!\" Moran recalls. \"He showed us on the X-ray that there was a tiny passage between the tonsils and the back of his throat \u2014 very small.\"\n\nEnlarged tonsils (and adenoids) are the most common cause of sleep-disordered breathing in children. So the doctor recommended tonsillectomy.\n\nBut Tyler's parents were worried about the surgery. It's usually done as an outpatient procedure now, but with general anesthesia. That's never without some risk.\n\n\"Your child is under,\" says Moran, \"completely under. This is not a local.\"\n\nOther complications include pain after surgery and the risk of bleeding; about 4 percent of people have complications that require readmission to the hospital.\n\nDespite hundreds of studies, there's still surprisingly little research on whether tonsillectomy really helps reduce the risk of sore throats. The operation continues to be controversial.\n\nNo less a personage than President Obama dissed tonsillectomy when he was stumping for health care overhaul in July 2009. In a prime time news conference, Obama said that doctors may think: \" 'You know what? I make a lot more money if I take this kid's tonsils out.' \"\n\nRosenfeld disputes Obama's claim, saying insurers usually pay a surgeon $200 to $300 for tonsil surgery.\n\nThe picture is further clouded because not all children with big tonsils have sleep-disordered breathing or frequent throat infections. Because of that, in 2002 the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that children have a sleep study before surgery is considered.\n\nAbout 530,000 tonsillectomies are performed in the United States each year. Obviously, parents could use some help in deciding whether surgery is needed. In January, the American Academy of Otolaryngology issued its first guidelines on tonsillectomy in children.\n\nWith sore throats, the ENTs recommend waiting (and treatment with antibiotics, if needed), unless a child has more than seven infections in a year. They'd recommend surgery if a child has five or more throat infections a year for two years, or three or more in three years.\n\nThere have been very few randomized studies on the effects of tonsillectomy for sleep-disordered breathing. Most of the researchers have asked parents or children whether they noticed improvements, and looked at a single measure, like behavior or quality of life. Still, the ENTs recommend tonsillectomy for sleep-disordered breathing, saying it reduces symptoms in most children.\n\nTyler's family decided to go ahead with the surgery; they went to the hospital at 5 a.m., and Tyler was home by noon. The doctors said he would be out of school for a week, but a throat infection kept him home a second week. His classmates sent him get-well cards.\n\nA year later, Tyler is feeling great. And his snoring is gone. \"Completely gone,\" his mom says. \"You can hear a pin-drop quiet when he sleeps.\"\n\nTyler still hears snoring at night, he says. But he knows that the culprit is not him, or the family dog. It's Dad.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story does a great job explaining how tonsil surgery as a first resort has evolved over the years.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "SCOTTSDALE, Arizona - A migraine is much more than just a bad headache. Migraine symptoms, which can be debilitating for many people, are the sixth leading cause of disability, according to the World Health Organization. While there is no cure, a new study published in Cephalalgia in March shows single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation is a new way to prevent migraine attacks. It's safe, easy to use and noninvasive.\n\nMULTIMEDIA ALERT: Video and audio are avaiable for download on the Mayo Clinic News Network.\n\nResearchers at Mayo Clinic and other major academic headache centers across the U.S. recently conducted the study that examined the effectiveness of using a single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation device to prevent migraine attacks. The eNeura SpringTMS Post-Market Observational U.S. Study of Migraine study, also known as ESPOUSE, instructed participants to self-administer four pulses with the device in the morning and four pulses at night over three months to prevent and treat migraine attacks as needed. Spring TMS stands for Spring transcranial magnetic stimulation or sTMS.\n\n\"The migraine brain is hyperexcitable, and basic science studies have demonstrated modulation of neuronal excitability with this treatment modality,\" says Amaal Starling, M.D., a Mayo Clinic neurologist, who is first author of the study. \"Our study demonstrated that the four pulses emitted from this device twice daily reduce the frequency of headache days by about three days per month, and 46 percent of patients had at least 50 percent or less migraine attacks per month on the treatment protocol. This data is clinically significant. Based on the current study and prior studies in acute migraine attack treatment, sTMS not only helps to stop a migraine attack, but it also helps prevent them.\"\n\n\"For certain patients, treatment options for migraines, such as oral medications, are not effective, well-tolerated or preferred,\" Dr. Starling adds. \"The sTMS may be a great option for these patients and allow doctors to better meet their unique needs.\"\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration already had approved the sTMS device for the acute treatment of migraine with aura.

One group was fed the equivalent of two servings (2 ounces) per day of walnuts for humans, while the second group received a similar control diet with no walnuts. After 25 days, researchers found that in walnut-fed mice, key miRNA that may affect cancer cell inflammation, vascularization (blood supply) and proliferation were positively engaged.\n\nThe tumors of mice fed the walnut-containing diet were found to have 10 times the amount of total omega-3 fatty acids, including plant-based alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), in the tissue compared to the mice fed the control diet. The study results found that a smaller tumor size was associated with greater percentage of omega-3s in tumor tissues, suggesting that ALA may provide a protective benefit. Tumor growth rate was also significantly slower in the walnut group compared to the control group. As this study was conducted on animals, results cannot yet be implied for humans.\n\nALA is an essential fatty acid critical to various body processes and is known to reduce inflammation. Walnuts are the only nut that contain a significant source of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) (2.5 grams per ounce). Walnuts also contain a variety of antioxidants, (3.7 mmol/ounce), and numerous vitamins and minerals.\n\nColorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer worldwide and is second to only lung cancer as the leading cause of death in Western Countries.1 Diet has been shown to be a modifiable risk factor in preventing many types of cancer, including colorectal cancer. It is estimated that 30-50 percent of colorectal cancer in men and 20 percent in women can be prevented by diet and other lifestyle changes.2\n\nAn article detailing these findings, \"Dietary Walnut Suppression of Colorectal Cancer in mice: mediation by miRNA patterns and fatty acid incorporation\" has been published in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry.3\n\nThis study was supported from a grant by the American Institute for Cancer Research and the California Walnut Commission.\n\nThe California Walnut Commission, established in 1987, is funded by mandatory assessments of the growers.

It does this by enhancing the protective neurohormonal systems (Natriuretic Peptide system) while simultaneously inhibiting the harmful effects of the overactive renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).11 Other heart failure medicines only block the harmful effects of the overactive RAAS.12 Entresto contains the neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril, and the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) valsartan.11\n\nEntresto is indicated in the US to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with chronic heart failure (NYHA Class II-IV) and reduced ejection fraction.11 Entresto is usually administered in conjunction with other heart failure therapies, in place of an Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).11 Entresto film-coated tablets are available in three dosage strengths: 24/26 mg, 49/51 mg, and 97/103 mg (sacubitril/valsartan).11 These doses are referred to as 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg in the clinical trial literature including the New England Journal of Medicine publication of the results of PARADIGM-HF. The target treatment dose of Entresto is 97/103 mg twice daily.11\n\nNovartis is committed to providing patients with affordable access and resources through Entresto Central.

Patients should talk to their doctor about other ways to treat heart failure if they plan to become pregnant. If a patient gets pregnant while taking Entresto, she should tell her doctor right away.\n\nPatients are not to take Entresto if they are allergic to sacubitril or valsartan or any of the ingredients in Entresto; have had an allergic reaction including swelling of the face, lips, tongue, throat or trouble breathing while taking a type of medicine called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB); or take an ACE inhibitor medicine. Patients are not to take Entresto for at least 36 hours before or after they take an ACE inhibitor medicine. Patients should talk with their doctor or pharmacist before taking Entresto if they are not sure if they take an ACE inhibitor medicine. Patients are not to take Entresto if they have diabetes and take a medicine that contains aliskiren.\n\nBefore they take Entresto, patients should tell their doctor about all of their medical conditions, including if they have kidney or liver problems; are pregnant or plan to become pregnant; are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Patients should either take Entresto or breastfeed. They should not do both.\n\nPatients should tell their doctor about all the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. They should especially tell their doctor if they take potassium supplements or a salt substitute; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); lithium; or other medicines for high blood pressure or heart problems such as an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or aliskiren.\n\nEntresto may cause serious side effects including serious allergic reactions causing swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat (angioedema) that may cause trouble breathing and death. Patients are to get emergency medical help right away if they have symptoms of angioedema or trouble breathing. Patients are not to take Entresto again if they have had angioedema while taking Entresto. People who are black or who have had angioedema may have a higher risk of having angioedema if they take Entresto. Entresto may cause low blood pressure (hypotension). Patients are to call their doctor if they become dizzy or lightheaded, or they develop extreme fatigue.

Some previous research has been limited by a number of factors, including the lack of a comparison group of obese patients who did not undergo bariatric surgery.\n\nWho and When: 8,385 obese patients in Israel who underwent bariatric surgery (laparoscopic banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy) from 2005-2014; 25,155 obese patients who received nonsurgical care for obesity management from primary care physicians that may have included dietary counseling and behavior modification.\n\nWhat (Study Measures): Bariatric surgery (exposure); death from any cause (outcome)\n\nHow (Study Design): This is a retrospective cohort study that used data from the past to compare obese patients who had bariatric surgery with those who didn't and death from any cause. The study is observational. Because researchers are not intervening for purposes of the study they cannot control for all the natural differences that could explain study findings.\n\nResults: The rate of death from any cause over about 4.5 years was lower among obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery compared with patients who managed their obesity with nonsurgical care.\n\nStudy Limitations: Imbalances caused by matching groups of obese patients for comparison based on age, sex, body mass index and diagnoses of diabetes.\n\nStudy Conclusions: The association between bariatric surgery and a lower rate of death from any cause adds to the limited literature describing the beneficial outcomes of these surgical procedures for obese patients.\n\nThe following related elements from this issue of JAMA are also available on the For The Media website:\n\n-- Effect of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy vs Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass on Weight Loss at 5 Years Among Patients With Morbid Obesity\n\n-- Effect of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy vs Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass on Weight Loss in Patients With Morbid Obesity\n\n-- Lifestyle Intervention and Medical Management With vs Without Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and Control of Hemoglobin A , LDL Cholesterol, and Systolic Blood Pressure at 5 Years in the Diabetes Surgery Study\n\n-- Association of Bariatric Surgery vs Medical Obesity Treatment With Long-term Medical Complications and Obesity-Related Comorbidities\n\n-- Editorial: Comparing the Outcomes of Sleeve Gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass for Severe Obesity\n\nFor more details and to read the full study, please visit the For The Media website.\n\nPlease see the article for additional information, including other authors, author contributions and affiliations, financial disclosures, funding and support, etc.\n\nWant to embed a link to this report in your story?

However, the study was small, and results from a larger trial aren't expected for several years, he added.\n\nDoctors often recommend a \"watch and wait\" period for men with low-grade, or less aggressive, prostate tumors. But many patients and their families aren't comfortable waiting and opt to have surgery before it's deemed medically necessary. These findings suggest that taking vitamin D might help reduce the need for such radical treatment.\n\nBut Dr. Anthony D'Amico, chief of radiation oncology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said that this study was too small to reach any definitive conclusion about the value of vitamin D in fighting prostate cancer.\n\n\"It's premature to make any conclusions,\" he said. The findings also need to be replicated in a much larger number of patients, D'Amico said.\n\nD'Amico stressed that men should not start taking vitamin D supplements in hopes of slowing or curing prostate cancer.\n\nVitamin D, known as the \"sunshine vitamin,\" is produced by the body when it's exposed to sun. It's also found in fortified dairy products and fatty fish.\n\nThe study results were scheduled for presentation Monday at the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in Denver.

There have been other articles [stating] that alcohol might be protective,\" said Dr. Guy Fiocco, assistant professor of internal medicine at Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine and director of rheumatology at Scott & White in Temple, Texas. \"[But] I don't think we're going to be advocating alcohol to prevent rheumatoid arthritis.\"\n\nNor do the study authors advise drinking as a cure for arthritis. \"We would wish to point out that, at the moment, that our findings are preliminary, and would not recommend that patients drink alcohol with the specific purpose of treating their arthritis,\" said Dr. James Maxwell, lead author of the study and a consultant rheumatologist at The Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust in England.\n\n\"We would also remind patients to observe recommended government limits for alcohol consumption,\" he added.\n\nAccording to background information in the study, published online July 28 in Rheumatology, previous studies were mostly conducted in mice. The benefit of ethanol exposure for these rodents seemed to be due to higher levels of testosterone, the researchers wrote.\n\nFor this study, the authors compared 1,004 healthy participants to 873 people with rheumatoid arthritis. Both of those groups were divided into four groups: nondrinkers, those who drank 1 to 5 days a month, the ones who drank 6 to 10 days a month, and those who drank more frequently.\n\n\"We found that arthritis was progressively less severe as alcohol frequency increased, with a definite difference compared to nondrinkers even in the least frequent alcohol consumption group,\" Maxwell said.\n\nThe teetotalers had quadruple the risk of having rheumatoid arthritis compared with those who drank in the highest category.\n\nAnd the more often one drank, the less damaging the rheumatoid arthritis tended to be, including healthier joints as shown on X-rays and less inflammation.\n\nThe association was seen in both men and women, though it was stronger in males.\n\nAlthough no one can pinpoint a reason for the link with certainty, \"essentially we think that alcohol may be having an effect by reducing the immune response, which leads to joint inflammation, and also that it may have a mild pain-killing effect,\" said Maxwell.\n\n\"There's a little information that alcohol can suppress the immune system,\" added Fiocco. \"What's been reported is that people who drink excessive alcohol actually have higher levels of the cytokines that lead to the inflammation and moderate amounts of alcohol actually may lower these levels.\"\n\nThis finding is slightly different than what is reported in the current study (that the severity of the disease decreased with more alcohol).\n\nBecause the researchers assessed drinking frequency, rather than the amount of alcohol consumed, it is not clear how much alcohol might be helpful, they said.\n\nAnd Maxwell stressed that their preliminary findings need to be replicated in the future.\n\n\"There are limitations to any research which asks patients to report their exposure to something (such as alcohol) over a period of time,\" Maxwell added. \"We would therefore recommend that a future prospective study should be performed to further assess the impact of alcohol consumption on rheumatoid arthritis, a study recording alcohol consumption at the time rather than asking about it later.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases has more on rheumatoid arthritis.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Not applicable.

This has implications for the treatment of acute tendon injuries and chronic tendon disease.\n\n\"Inflammation plays a critical role in acute and chronic tendon injuries and healing,\" said Chang H. Lee, Ph.D., a researcher involved in the work and an assistant professor at the Regenerative Engineering Laboratory (Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York). \"Our findings represent an important foundation for the development of a new treatment that would regulate overwhelmed inflammation for tendon ruptures and tears, tendonitis, tendinopathy, and other tendon injuries and diseases.\"\n\nIn their study, Lee and colleagues used both in vitro human models and in vivo rat models. In vitro, isolated TSCs were stimulated with proinflammatory cytokines (proteins that can influence interactions between cells), and the expression of genes involved in inflammatory regulation was measured. In vivo, the researchers evaluated inflammatory responses by TSCs, including infiltration of macrophages (white blood cells that consume damaged or dead cells) and expression of anti-/proinflammatory cytokines, at different time points. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was used in both models to stimulate the anti-inflammatory roles of TSCs. The researchers found that CTGF stimulation induced TSCs' production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, consequently leading to improved tendon healing and matrix remodeling.\n\n\"Many would have predicted that tendon healing is inflammation-linked,\" said Thoru Pederson, Ph.D., Editor-in-Chief of The FASEB Journal, \"but that the anti-inflammatory roles of TSCs could be so potent, and so amplifiable, is a striking finding.\"\n\nSubmit to The FASEB Journal by visiting http://fasebj. , and receive monthly highlights by signing up at http://www. .

New stretch marks were also softer and smoother in 54 women who used the cream for three months, says Zoe Draelos, MD, a consulting professor of dermatology at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C. \"The stretch marks did not go away,\" she tells WebMD. \"But [after several weeks of treatment], the cream made them look and feel better,\" she says. The study, funded by Merz Pharmaceuticals, which makes the cream, was presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology. Draelos has served as a consultant to Merz.\n\nDraelos estimates that up to 98% of women and 75% of men have stretch marks, which appear as wavy, linear red scars, typically on the hips, breasts, thighs, and stomach of women, and the buttocks and pectoralarea of men. They form when the skin is rapidly stretched, such as during puberty, pregnancy, and rapid weight gain, says Joshua Zeichner, MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research at Mt.

In fact, the physician has wagered a few good bottles of champagne that none of three large randomized trials now underway will find proof of positive effects.\n\nTo Autier, a researcher at the Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences in Glasgow, Scotland, the widespread faith in vitamin D\u2019s benefits is like a religion. \u201cPeople want to have a simple story they can believe in,\u201d he says.\n\nCedric Garland, meanwhile, hews just as strongly to the opposite view \u2014 that vitamin D supplements confer a slew of benefits, including warding off colon cancer, breast cancer, even Type 1 diabetes.\n\n\u201cThe science is, in my opinion, unassailable,\u201d says Garland, an adjunct professor of epidemiology at the University of California at San Diego. \u201cIt\u2019s just preposterous to say it\u2019s not proven.\u201d\n\nIn January 2014, Autier published a statistical analysis of results from hundreds of studies of vitamin D. He concluded: \u201cUnfortunately, there is probably no benefit to expect from vitamin D supplementation in normally healthy people.\u201d\n\nGarland, on the other hand, is the co-author of dozens of studies showing a strong, inverse association between vitamin D levels and seemingly every disease under the sun. Indeed, sun exposure is Garland\u2019s explanation for why rates of cancer, Type 1 diabetes and other diseases tend to be higher the farther people live from the equator. Vitamin D, after all, is the \u201csunshine vitamin,\u201d synthesized from cholesterol in the skin in response to sunlight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mathematical relationship,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe higher your latitude and the greater your area\u2019s average cloud cover, the higher your rates of cancer.\u201d Since he and his late brother, Frank Garland, published the first study, in 1980, revealing that relationship, hundreds of other studies have explored the link between vitamin D, including supplements, and health \u2014 but none were large enough, long enough or designed well enough to convince the skeptics.\n\nNow three nationally recognized researchers are leading landmark studies designed to settle at least some of the questions about vitamin D once and for all. The one thing the research leaders are certain of is that the public\u2019s faith in vitamin D as a modern panacea has far outpaced what the scientific evidence proves.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a rush to judgment on vitamin D,\u201d says JoAnn E. Manson, chief of the division of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. \u201cEveryone has gotten on the bandwagon. Unfortunately, the lessons of history have shown repeatedly that many of these supplements that appeared to be very promising did not pan out in more rigorous testing.\u201d\n\nManson should know. She has led or collaborated on more than a dozen large, randomized, placebo-controlled studies, dating back more than two decades, which found none of the expected protection against cancer, heart disease, dementia or other diseases that scientists once attributed to beta carotene, vitamin E or vitamin C supplements. (She did find, however, that supplementation with folic acid, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 offered modest protection against age-related macular degeneration and, for those with a diet low in B vitamins to begin with, a hint of protection against the loss of cognitive abilities.)\n\nNow Manson is co-directing the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL), testing whether, compared with placebo, a daily supplement of either 2,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D or one gram of fish oil (another widely touted substance) reduces the risk of stroke, cancer, heart disease and other health problems. The five-year study, involving 25,874 men and women, is scheduled to end in October 2017.\n\nAnother trial is testing whether a daily supplement of 4,000 IU of vitamin D will prevent Type 2 diabetes. The so-called D2d study, which will run for four years, is seeking to enroll 2,382 people older than 30 who are at high risk of developing diabetes due to weight or blood-sugar levels but who have not yet been diagnosed with the disease.\n\n\u201cI would call myself an optimistic skeptic,\u201d says Anastasios Pittas, principal investigator of the D2d study and a professor of medicine at Tufts School of Medicine in Boston. \u201cThe indirect evidence is very strong. People with higher levels of vitamin D in their blood have been shown again and again to have a lower risk of developing diabetes in the future. These studies are as consistent as we have ever seen with any nutrient.\u201d\n\nBut, he adds, \u201cthose studies do not prove cause and effect. Before we make a blanket recommendation for the 86 million people in the United States who are at risk for Type 2 diabetes to go out and buy vitamin D supplements, we need to know for sure if they help.\u201d\n\nA third trial, designed to test whether 5,000 IU of vitamin D per day will slow the progression of multiple sclerosis in 172 patients, is being led by Ellen Mowry, an associate professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cI do discuss vitamin D with my patients,\u201d Mowry says. \u201cBut I point out that we don\u2019t yet have randomized, controlled-trials data to back it up. That\u2019s why there are no official recommendations yet from any medical organizations. We have to be sure.\u201d\n\nSo what are people to do in the meantime? Four years ago, Manson sat on a committee established by the Institute of Medicine to review how much vitamin D and calcium Americans need each day to maintain health and prevent disease. The report concluded that both are necessary for bone health but that as for preventing cancer, heart disease, diabetes and autoiummune disorders, the evidence was \u201cinconsistent, inconclusive as to causality, and insufficient to inform nutritional requirements.\u201d Even so, the committee recommended that children and adults up to age 70 get 600 IU of vitamin D daily \u2014 from food and, if necessary, supplements \u2014 and that adults age 71 and older get 800 IU.\n\nSome studies have found no ill effects from taking far higher amounts, and many of the prospective but not proven benefits against cancer and other diseases are believed to require doses ranging from 2,000 to 5,000 IU. Manson urges people to rely on the Institute of Medicine report, which set a safe upper limit of 4,000 IU of vitamin D per day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine to take that amount,\u201d Manson said. \u201cBut keep in mind, there isn\u2019t yet evidence that taking those higher amounts will confer any benefits beyond the recommended daily allotment of 600 to 800 IU.\u201d\n\nSome studies, she noted, have even found evidence that very high levels of vitamin D circulating in the blood might be just as unhealthful as very low levels. A 2014 study, for instance, found that people with the highest levels of vitamin D in their blood (more than 60 nanograms per milliliter) were significantly more likely to die in the three months following a hospitalization as were people whose levels were between 30 and 49.9 ng/mL. Such findings are why she, Mowry and Pittas strongly advise people against taking more than the currently recommended upper daily limit of 4,000 IU, even though doses as high as 10,000 IU are available online and at many stores.\n\nFrustrated by the uncertainty? Pittas takes it in stride.\n\n\u201cThis is the beauty of medical research,\u201d he says, \u201cwhere you have some people convinced that vitamin D does nothing and others who believe it\u2019s already proved to work. There is such controversy now that the only way to convince people who sit on those sides of the equation is to complete rigorous, randomized trials. We\u2019ll see what happens. I have a hypothesis that vitamin D will work, but we have to test it. At the end of the studies, one of us will be right. I just don\u2019t know which one.\u201d\n\nHurley is a science journalist and author of \u201cNatural Causes: Death, Lies and Politics in America\u2019s Vitamin and Herbal Supplement Industry\u201d (Broadway Books, 2007).", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "It\u2019s clear from the story that vitamin D is widely available from food and supplements.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Since her teens, Lesa Merlo, of Hinsdale, had learned to compensate as her hearing declined.

Pick a diet you think you could stick to better, and work with your physician to help you target the right intervention for you,\" he advised. Two other studies in the same issue of the journal look at the effectiveness of the anti-hypertension DASH diet and a physician-supervised plan.\n\nObesity is a significant contributor to many illnesses, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes and many cancers, according to an editorial in the same journal by Dr. Robert Kushner of Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine. More than one-third of American adults are obese, and the incidence of obesity has gone up 140 percent over the past decade, Kushner notes.\n\nYancy's study included 146 overweight or obese adults who were randomly assigned to a low-carbohydrate diet or orlistat with a low-fat diet. The average age of the study participants was 52 and the average body-mass index was 39 (30 and over is considered obese). Orlistat is marketed as Xenical, a prescription medication, and Alli, available over the counter.\n\nThe low-carb diet began with a carbohydrate intake of less than 20 grams of carbohydrates a day. The group taking orlistat received a 120-milligram dose of the drug three times daily and got less than 30 percent of their calories from fat.\n\nOver 48 weeks, the low-carbohydrate group lost 9.5 percent of their body weight, while the orlistat group lost 8.5 percent. \"Good\" cholesterol (HDL) and triglyceride levels improved in both groups. LDL, or \"bad\" cholesterol, was only reduced in the orlistat group. Insulin and glucose markers improved only in the low-carb group, and there was a significant drop in blood pressure in the low-carb group compared to the orlistat group -- systolic blood pressure (the top number) dropped by 5.9 mm Hg on the low-carb diet vs. 1.5 mm Hg for the orlistat group. Similar reductions were seen for diastolic blood pressure.\n\nYancy said the blood pressure and cholesterol drops might have been even more impressive if people had stayed on their medications, but as they lost weight and normalized these readings, the doctors took them off blood-pressure and cholesterol drugs.\n\nTwo other studies in the same issue of the journal looked at the effects of the DASH diet and a physician-supervised plan.\n\nResearchers compared the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet alone and in combination with exercise and weight management on blood pressure. The researchers found that combining the DASH diet with weight management and exercise resulted in a 16.1 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure compared to 11.2 mm Hg on the DASH diet alone. Additionally, those in the exercise, weight management and DASH plan lost an average of 19 pounds over four months vs. less than one pound for the DASH diet alone.\n\nThe third study compared an Internet weight-management program with a physician-managed program for extremely obese people that included a liquid diet component, followed by a structured diet, behavioral counseling and diet medications. The more intensive intervention was more successful with 31 percent losing more than 5 percent of their body weight, compared to just 9 percent of the Internet group.\n\n\"There are many paths to weight loss,\" said registered dietitian Karen Congro, director of the Wellness for Life Program at The Brooklyn Hospital Center in New York City. What often makes the difference in whether or not a diet is successful, she said, is whether or not there's a counseling and support component to the plan.\n\nAnd, she said, these studies show that you don't necessarily need to get to your \"ideal body weight\" to make substantial improvements to your health. Losing 5 percent to 10 percent of your body weight can make positive changes in blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose control.\n\n\"If it can make you a healthier person, then a diet is a success,\" said Congro.\n\nFor advice on selecting a weight-loss plan, visit the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story states that orlistat is available via prescription as Xenical and over the counter as Alli.

But after 11 months, more than half of the combination group had yet to see their disease worsen. Overall survival data was not yet available.\n\n\u201cLonger follow-up will be helpful to see the durability of these responses and what happens to patients who had complete responses,\u201d said Hodi, who presented data from the Checkpoint-069 study at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Philadelphia.

It works by taking the brakes off the immune system to more efficiently attack cancer. Opdivo (nivolumab) belongs to a promising new class of drugs called PD-1 inhibitors that block a mechanism tumors use to hide from the immune system.\n\nIn a separate group of 33 patients with a mutation of the BRAF gene involved in cancer cell growth, the overall response rate was 52 percent for the combination. The complete response rate was 22 percent. That compared with 1 percent overall response rate and no complete responses for Yervoy alone.\n\nThe combination of the two drugs also led to far higher levels of side effects, such as colitis and inflammation of lung tissue, at 54 percent versus 24 percent for Yervoy alone.

But help could soon be at hand in the form of a nasal spray, new research suggests.\n\nA spritz of a synthetic hormone, already used by bed-wetting kids, might benefit older people struggling with the problem called nocturia.\n\n\"Nocturia is very common in patients over 50 years old, and can cause significant problems by causing loss of sleep, and injury due to falls,\" said study lead author Dr. Jed Kaminetsky.\n\nThe millions of people with nocturia wake up two or more times a night to urinate. Besides an enlarged prostate, Kaminetsky said, common causes are bladder problems, poor circulation and obesity.\n\nKaminetsky is a clinical assistant professor of urology at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City.\n\nIn the United States there's no approved drug to treat the problem, the study authors said.\n\nThe new drug, while promising, is of concern because of its potential to lower blood sodium levels in the elderly, one doctor said. Meanwhile, another researcher suggested that exercise might help stave off nocturia.\n\nKnown as SER-120, the nasal spray contains desmopressin, a low-dose synthetic version of the naturally occurring hormone vasopressin. Vasopressin, an anti-diuretic, reduces urine production.\n\nSER-120 appears to delay urine production for four to six hours during sleep, said Kaminetsky, \"and wears off by morning when patients awaken and start to drink fluids.\"\n\nHe is scheduled to present his team's research Sunday in San Diego at a meeting of the American Urological Association. The research was funded by the spray's manufacturer, Serenity Pharmaceuticals.\n\nDesmopressin is commonly used to treat bed-wetting among children ages 6 and up, the study authors pointed out.\n\nTo assess its potential in adults, the study team enlisted nearly 1,400 men and women, 50 and older, who had a history of nocturia.\n\nFor three months, participants were randomly assigned to use either the desmopressin spray (two doses were tried) or a non-medicinal spray (a placebo).\n\nPatients kept three-day urination diaries, and filled out quality-of-life questionnaires.\n\nDesmopressin spray prompted \"a significant decrease\" in the frequency of nightly bathroom trips compared with the untreated group, Kaminetsky said. On average, patients reported at least two fewer episodes a night.\n\nThe treatment group also experienced a \"significant increase\" in the length of time they could sleep before awakening to urinate. That uninterrupted sleep period extended to more than four hours, Kaminetsky said.\n\nThe researchers also found that those in the higher-dose spray group experienced a \"significant improvement\" in overall quality of life, compared with the untreated group.\n\nThough SER-120 is still considered investigational, Kaminetsky said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is reviewing the findings, with a possible decision late this year.\n\nDr. Tomas Griebling, a professor of urology at the University of Kansas, described the study results as \"promising,\" but added a note of caution.\n\n\"Other researchers have examined the utility and safety of desmopressin for the treatment of nocturia in the past,\" he said. \"However, there have been concerns about safety, particularly in elderly patients.\"\n\nGriebling said the American Geriatrics Society includes desmopressin in the Beers Criteria for potentially inappropriate medications for older adults, primarily because of concerns about resulting low blood sodium levels.\n\nBut the lower doses used in this study (1.5 or 0.75 mcg) \"may help to improve the overall safety profile, particularly for geriatric patients,\" he said. \"Additional research will be needed to fully answer this question in the future.\"\n\nThe study team said two of the higher-dose patients developed significantly low blood sodium levels (hyponatremia) as did one person taking the placebo.\n\nDr. Julien Dagenais, a urologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, explored nocturia from another angle. He analyzed physical activity data reported by more than 10,000 men and women (aged 20 and older) in a U.S. health and nutrition survey conducted between 2005 and 2010.\n\nPeople who reported higher levels of exercise were less likely to suffer from nocturia, Dagenais found. This suggests that the anti-inflammatory impact of routine exercise may minimize nocturia, he said.\n\nThese findings will also be presented at the American Urological Association meeting.

The vaccine won approval from the Food and Drug Administration on Feb. 3, and some doctors have received supplies of it.\n\nThe recommendation for universal use of the vaccine was approved at a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the federal panel that sets vaccination policy in the United States. It comes nearly seven years after an earlier rotavirus vaccine was withdrawn from the market for causing a potentially life-threatening form of intestinal blockage in some babies.\n\nVaccine-safety advocates are urging parents to be wary of the new vaccine because of that history. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the manufacturer, Merck & Co. Inc. of Whitehouse Station, N.J., have promised elaborate studies to catch any safety problems. Merck is selling the vaccine under the brand name RotaTeq.\n\nMerck has tested the vaccine in about 70,000 babies in 11 countries, one of the biggest vaccine trials ever conducted. That test ruled out a safety problem similar to the one that felled RotaShield, an earlier rotavirus vaccine developed by Wyeth, a drugmaker in Madison, N.J. But doctors said it is impossible to design a test big enough to catch all possible side effects that might show up once the product is used in millions of children.\n\nRotaTeq \"generally appears to have a better safety profile than the earlier vaccine,\" said Umesh D. Parashar, a medical epidemiologist at the CDC. \"But at the same time it's something we'll continue to look at, and hopefully confirm absence of risk.\"\n\nRotaTeq is expected to be one of the most expensive vaccines ever marketed, with Merck listing it at $187.50 wholesale for the three-dose series. That means many doctors are likely to charge more than $300 retail, putting the Merck product in league with Prevnar, an expensive Wyeth vaccine that has been widely used in the United States for five years. Prevnar, which protects children against certain types of pneumonia, became the first vaccine to meet the pharmaceutical industry's standard for a blockbuster product, with sales exceeding $1 billion a year.\n\nThe development of such high-priced vaccines is causing strains, particularly in state-sponsored vaccination programs for certain low-income children. But it is also drawing new manufacturers into the vaccine market, which many drug companies had abandoned in the 1980s and 1990s, citing too little profit.\n\nRotaShield appeared on the market in late 1998 but was pulled less than a year later after a handful of babies that received it developed a serious intestinal problem called intussusception, a type of bowel obstruction that occurs when the intestine folds in on itself, like a collapsing telescope.\n\nThe problem occurs naturally, albeit rarely; it showed up at a sharply elevated rate in babies who received RotaShield. Intussusception is life-threatening for some babies, though doctors can usually treat it.\n\nMany people have never heard of rotavirus, but it is one of the most common causes of childhood illness -- many ailments that parents or pediatricians describe as \"stomach flu\" are caused by rotavirus infection. Virtually every child in the world contracts the virus repeatedly by age 5, gradually building immunity.\n\nMost children get over rotavirus at home, but at least 55,000 American children are hospitalized every year after becoming dehydrated from vomiting and diarrhea associated with the infection. Fifty to 60 of them die, but it is a different story overseas, where babies often do not receive good medical care and hundreds of thousands die every year.\n\nRotaTeq contains live, but weakened, strains of rotavirus designed to build immunity without causing illness.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "", "answer": 1}, {"article": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. \u2014 Researchers at Mayo Clinic\u2019s campus in Florida have conducted the world\u2019s first prospective, blinded and placebo-controlled clinical study to test the benefit of using bone marrow stem cells, a regenerative medicine therapy, to reduce arthritic pain and disability in knees.\n\nThe researchers say such testing is needed because there are at least 600 stem cell clinics in the U.S. offering one form of stem cell therapy or another to an estimated 100,000-plus patients, who pay thousands of dollars, out of pocket, for the treatment, which has not undergone demanding clinical study.\n\nThe findings in The American Journal of Sports Medicine include an anomalous finding \u2014 patients not only had a dramatic improvement in the knee that received stem cells, but also in their other knee, which also had painful arthritis but received only a saline control injection. Each of the 25 patients enrolled in the study had two bad knees, but did not know which knee received the stem cells.\n\nGiven that the stem cell-treated knee was no better than the control-treated knee \u2014 both were significantly better than before the study began \u2014 the researchers say the stem cells\u2019 effectiveness remains somewhat uninterpretable. They are only able to conclude the procedure is safe to undergo as an option for knee pain, but they cannot yet recommend it for routine arthritis care.\n\n\u201cOur findings can be interpreted in ways that we now need to test \u2014 one of which is that bone marrow stem cell injection in one ailing knee can relieve pain in both affected knees in a systemic or whole-body fashion,\u201d says the study\u2019s lead author, Shane Shapiro, M.D., a Mayo Clinic orthopedic physician.\n\nJournalists, sound bites with Dr. Shane Shapiro are available in the downloads below.\n\n\u201cOne hypothesis is that the stem cells we tested can home to areas of injury where they are needed, which makes sense, given that stem cells injected intravenously in cancer treatments end up in the patients\u2019 bone marrow where they need to go,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is just a theory that can explain our results, so it needs further testing.\u201d\n\nAnother explanation is that merely injecting any substance into a knee offered relief from pain.\n\n\u201cThat could be, but both this idea and the notion that a placebo effect could be involved would be surprising, given that some patients are still doing very well years after their study treatment ended,\u201d says Dr. Shapiro.\n\nHe adds that these findings are important because while use of a patient\u2019s own stem cells for regenerative therapy is extraordinarily popular, the treatments may be untested and are often poorly regulated.\n\nStem cell clinics often offer expensive treatments for conditions that range from multiple sclerosis, lung and heart disease, to cosmetic treatments, such as facelifts. None of these techniques have been studied because clinics maintain that use of a patient\u2019s own cells is not a drug.\n\nBut, depending on how they are processed and used, stem cells can, in fact, be regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as biological products or drugs requiring rigorous safety and efficacy approval processes. In early September, the FDA held scientific meetings to clarify how to regulate such practices.\n\n\u201cWe feel that if we are going to offer any stem cell procedures to our patients, the science needs to be worked out,\u201d Dr. Shapiro says.\n\nThe study was conducted in Mayo\u2019s Human Cell Therapy Lab. Researchers extracted 60 to 90 milliliters of bone marrow from each patient, then filtered it, removed all blood cells, and concentrated it down to 4 to 5 milliliters. The solution, which contained tens of thousands of stem cells, was injected into a patient\u2019s knee using ultrasound-guided imagery.\n\n\u201cWe actually counted all of the stem cells with markers that are accepted by the FDA, and we made sure they would be able to survive inside the patient,\u201d Dr. Shapiro says. \u201cCounting is expensive. Most clinics just draw the cells from bone marrow or fat and inject them back into the patient without checking for stem cells, hoping that patients get better,\u201d he says.\n\nDr. Shapiro and his colleagues are currently designing new studies that will test whether the stem cells home to distant areas of injuries, as well as exploring other implications suggested in their findings.\n\nStudy investigators include Mayo Clinic in Florida senior author Mary L. O\u2019Connor, M.D., Shari E. Kazmerchak, Michael G. Heckman, and Abba C. Zubair, M.D., Ph.D. Dr. O\u2019Connor is now at Yale University.\n\nFunding for this study was from Mayo Clinic\u2019s Center for Regenerative Medicine.\n\nAbout Mayo Clinic\n\n Mayo Clinic is a nonprofit organization committed to clinical practice, education and research, providing expert, whole-person care to everyone who needs healing.

But hormone use plummeted after the federal government's massive Women's Health Initiative shocked women and doctors by concluding the risks of the medication outweighed its benefits.\n\nSince then, many women have been suffering through hot flashes and searching for effective alternatives. Some small pilot studies have indicated that the newer class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin and serotonin norepinephrine reupdate inhibitors (SSRIs and SNRIs) might be effective.\n\nIn the new study, Ellen Freeman of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia and colleagues gave 205 women who were either starting to go through menopause who had already gone through menopause either Lexapro or a placebo for eight weeks. When the study started, the women were having an average of nearly 10 hot flashes each day.\n\nThe number of hot flashes among the women taking Lexapro, which is also known as escitalopram, dropped to about five on average after eight weeks--a 47 percent decrease or about 4.6 fewer hot flashes per day, the researchers reported. The severity of the hot flashes also decreased. Among those taking a placebo, the number of hot flashes dropped to 6.43 per day, a 33 percent decrease of 3.2 fewer hot flashes per day. Lexapro seemed to work even among women who were not anxious or depressed.\n\nThe hot flashes increased after the women stopped taking the drug but not among those taking a placebo.\n\nAlthough the benefit was modest, it appeared to be significant enough that women might consider trying it, the researchers said. The study is the first to examine whether there are any racial differences in how well an antidepressant works in alleviating hot flashes. African-American women are more likely than white women to report hot flashes. The study found none.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story did not comment on the availability of Lexapro to treat hot flashes.

Plus, Medicare does not currently reimburse patients for routine screening with virtual colonoscopy, but does cover evaluations with colonoscopy. Add to that the aggressive public awareness campaign for colonoscopy screening led by celebrities like Katie Couric, who allowed TV cameras in as she got her first test, and it\u2019s clear why more people are familiar with the scope than with its virtual cousin.\n\nBut in spite of those challenges, Megan McHugh at the Health Research and Educational Trust in Chicago and her team report that about 17% of hospitals in the U.S. now offer the screening test, up from 13% in 2005.\n\nAs its name implies, virtual colonoscopy is way to survey the colon without actually using a scope. Patients lie in a CT scanner, which takes a series of pictures from a variety of different angles, and a computer compiles the snapshots in two different ways. The images can be viewed as two dimensional CT scans, which display any possible abnormalities protruding from the lining of the colon. Or, the images can be combined to generate a 3D view of the colon, allowing the doctors to \u201cfly through\u201d the organ looking for any suspicious growths or protrusions.\n\nThe prep for both the virtual and actual colonoscopy is the same \u2014 the dreaded \u201ccolon cleanse\u201d that many patients find is the worst part of the procedure. The night before the test, they start drinking clear liquids and take agents to loosen their stools and empty their colon so any remaining debris isn\u2019t mistaken for a tumor during the screen.\n\nWhile the virtual colonoscopy does not require the sedation and insertion of a scope that colonoscopy does, it involves exposure to a small amount of radiation. But according to Dr. Marc Gollub, director of CT and gastrointestinal radiology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, \u201cthe radiation is much lower than a regular CT scan and has not been proven to be of any risk. It\u2019s similar to [the exposure from cosmic radiation] you might get on a long airplane flight.\u201d\n\nWhile a growing body of data suggest that virtual colonoscopy is as sensitive as colonoscopy in picking up potential tumors, not all cancer experts agree that it\u2019s a good alternative to the gold-standard scope. While the American Cancer Society, the American College of Physicians and other gastroenterology experts recommend virtual screening every five years, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a congressionally mandated but non-federal, independent group of medical experts, concluded the evidence wasn\u2019t strong enough to justify Medicare coverage of the service.\n\nSo which one is right for you? Virtual colonoscopy is a good option for those who can\u2019t be sedated for colonoscopy, or who simply can\u2019t tolerate the scope. In McHugh\u2019s survey, hospitals reported that these patients make up the bulk of their use. And given the relatively low cost of investing in the software and other equipment required to run a virtual scan, more hospitals may be adding the option to their patient services. The virtual scan does involve radiation exposure, and if doctors find an abnormality that needs to be removed, you\u2019ll have to undergo a colonoscopy anyway (to avoid another colon cleanse, consider scheduling a colonoscopy on the same day in case tumors need to be removed). But Gollub notes that only about 8% of healthy adults getting regularly screened actually have tumors.\n\nGiven the fact that more hospitals are offering virtual colonoscopy, it\u2019s worth discussing with your doctor. In the end, it\u2019s a matter of personal preference \u2014 it\u2019s less important how you get screened, just that you do get screened.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story is based on estimates of the rising use of virtual colonoscopy and cites one estimate that 17% of US hospials now offer it.

Herniation occurs where the jelly-like material in the center of the disk bulges through a tear in the disk's tough exterior layer and puts pressure on the roots of the nerves. Herniated disks are often the source of sciatica, or pain that radiates downward from the lower back into the leg.\n\nConservative treatment options for herniated disks range from over-the-counter pain medications to injections of corticosteroids directly into the affected area of the spine. Those who don't respond may require surgery. In some cases, the entire disk must be removed and the vertebra fused together for stability.\n\nAn alternative technique, CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency (pRF), applies energy through an electrode under CT guidance to the portion of the nerve responsible for sending pain signals.\n\n\"Pulsed radiofrequency creates a nerve modulation, significantly reducing inflammation and its associated symptoms,\" said study senior author Alessandro Napoli, M.D., Ph.D., professor of interventional radiology at Sapienza University of Rome in Italy.\n\nDr. Napoli and colleagues studied the approach in patients with back pain from lumbar disk herniation that had not responded to prolonged conservative treatment. In 128 patients, the pRF treatment was delivered directly under CT guidance to the root of the nerve. The treatment was applied for 10 minutes.\n\nFor comparison, a group of 120 patients received one to three sessions of CT-guided steroid injection on the same anatomical target with no pRF.\n\nThe one-year outcomes demonstrated that CT-guided pRF was superior to the injection-only strategy. Patients who received pRF saw greater overall improvement in pain and disability scores during the first year. Relief of leg pain was faster in patients assigned to pRF, and they also reported a faster rate of perceived recovery. The probability of perceived recovery after one year of follow-up was 95 percent in the pRF group, compared with 61 percent in the injection only group.\n\n\"Given our study results, we offer pulsed radiofrequency to patients with herniated disk and sciatic nerve compression whose symptoms do not benefit from conservative therapy,\" Dr. Napoli said.\n\nThe results of the study are superior to those typically reported for usual care strategies and injections and may help a substantial number of patients with sciatic disk compression to avoid surgery, Dr. Napoli added.\n\nThe use of pRF also could improve outcomes for patients set to receive corticosteroid injections.\n\n\"We learned that when pulsed radiofrequency is followed by steroid injection, the result is longer lasting and more efficacious than injection only,\" Dr. Napoli said. \"The effect of pulsed radiofrequency is fast and without adverse events.\"\n\nToday, therapy for spine disorders allows for definitive treatment of symptoms and conditions using different techniques and technologies.\n\n\"Of the different therapies available, pulsed radiofrequency is among the least invasive,\" Dr. Napoli said. \"Treatment lasts 10 minutes, and one session was enough in a large number of treated patients.\"\n\nNote: Copies of RSNA 2018 news releases and electronic images will be available online at RSNA.org/press18 beginning Monday, Nov. 26.\n\nRSNA is an association of over 54,000 radiologists, radiation oncologists, medical physicists and related scientists, promoting excellence in patient care and health care delivery through education, research and technologic innovation.

The women completed questionnaires about their diet every four years for 18 years.\n\nDuring the study period, 405 participants had heart attacks. Women who ate the most blueberries and strawberries were 32 percent less likely to have a heart attack, compared to women who ate berries once a month or less. This held true even among women who ate a diet rich in other fruits and vegetables.\n\nThis benefit was independent of other heart risk factors such as advancing age, high blood pressure, family history of heart attack, body mass index, exercise, smoking, and caffeine and alcohol intake. The findings appear online Jan. 14 in the journal Circulation.\n\nThe study can't say specifically what about the berries seemed to result in a lower risk of heart attack among these women, or that there was a direct cause-and-effect link between eating the berries and lowered heart attack risk. But blueberries and strawberries contain high levels of compounds that may help widen arteries, which counters plaque buildup, the researchers said. Heart attacks can occur when plaque blocks blood flow to the heart.\n\n\"Berries were the most commonly consumed sources of these substances in the U.S. diet, and they are one of the best sources of these powerful bioactive compounds,\" said study lead author Aedin Cassidy. \"These substances, called anthocyanins -- a flavonoid -- are naturally present in red- and blue-colored fruits and vegetables, so they are also found in high amounts in cherries, grapes, eggplant, black currants, plums and other berries.\"\n\nMen are likely to benefit from eating berries as well, although this study included only women, said Cassidy, who is head of the department of nutrition at Norwich Medical School at the University of East Anglia, in England.\n\nAlthough more research is needed to confirm these benefits, \"these data are important from a public health perspective because these fruits can be readily incorporated into the habitual diet,\" the study concluded.\n\nDr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a preventive cardiologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, noted that this was a \"huge study that followed women for a long period of time. Women who ate three or more servings of strawberries and blueberries per week decreased their heart attack risk by one-third. This is pretty compelling.\"\n\nSteinbaum's advice to both women and men is to include berries in their diet, and make them part of their daily fruit and vegetable fill.\n\nOne serving of blueberries or strawberries equals about one cup.\n\nDana Greene, a nutritionist in Boston, regularly tells her patients to consume more fruits and vegetables, including berries.\n\n\"They are so good for you,\" Greene said. Besides flavonoids, berries also are loaded with other nutrients, including vitamin C, potassium and folate.\n\n\"I tell all patients to make sure that half of their plate is filled with fruits and vegetables, especially richly colored ones like blueberries and strawberries,\" Greene said. \"Berries can also help people lose weight and maintain that loss because they feel fuller faster.

The study was conducted at the IMIM-Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned to take the decaffeinated green tea extract or placebo for one year. All subjects also underwent cognitive training during the 12-month trial.\n\nAfter one year of treatment, functional brain scans (fMRI) showed that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)-treated subjects had improved neuronal connectivity in certain brain regions. Participants who took the green tea extract also scored significantly better on assessments of visual recognition memory, inhibitory control, and adaptive behavior compared with those who took the placebo.\n\n\"It's an important trial,\" says Dr. Steven Hirsh, director of clinical research for Life Extension in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. \"The findings are very noteworthy and support further study in randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes and durations. It is very encouraging that this catechin, EGCG, from green tea extract, has the potential to benefit people with Down syndrome.\"\n\nDown syndrome is a genetic condition that affects about 250,000 Americans. Individuals with Down syndrome have an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 21.\n\nThe team of researchers, led by Dr. Rafael de la Torre, program director of IMIM Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute and study co-principal investigator, and Dr. Mara Dierssen, group leader at Center for Genomic Regulation, Barcelona, Spain, and study co-principal investigator, proposed that EGCG might have conferred these benefits by inhibiting an enzyme called DYRK1A, which has been implicated in Down syndrome and neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer disease.\n\nThe level of DYRK1A-positive cells is elevated in certain regions of Alzheimer disease patients' brains, and is roughly 20-fold higher in the frontal cortex, compared to normal brains. DYRK1A is implicated in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (via tau hyperphosphorylation) and amyloid plaques, both of which are features of Alzheimer disease.\n\nTea catechins may also modulate the damaging effects of amyloid-beta. Several animal studies have found that EGCG and related compounds from tea suppress amyloid-beta-induced cognitive dysfunction and neurotoxicity. Other possible mechanisms by which EGCG may influence cognition include epigenetic regulation, restoration of mitochondrial function, and anti-oxidative functions.\n\nIn an earlier pilot study supported by Life Extension, Drs. de la Torre and Dierssen's team showed that three months of EGCG treatment improved symptoms in individuals with Down syndrome, and in mice with a Down-syndrome-like condition characterized by overexpression of DYRK1A.\n\n\"We are excited that the benefits observed in the early pilot and preclinical research extended to this larger trial,\" says Luke G.

Numbness and pain stemming from nerve damage were the most common adverse event connected to eribulin that led women to drop out of the study (24, or 5 percent).\n\nThe study, known as the EMBRACE trial, was funded by Eisai Inc., which markets eribulin.

And some of the latest research seems to support those ideas.\n\nOne long-term study of middle-aged Finnish men found those who spent time in a sauna 2-3 days a week enjoyed a 23% drop in their risk for a fatal heart disease or episode. The heart health benefits were even greater for men who sweated it out in a sauna more frequently.\n\n\u201cSauna bathing leads to a significant increase in heart rate and reduction in total vascular resistance, thereby decreasing blood pressure,\u201d says Dr. Ernst van der Wall, chief of cardiology at the Netherlands Leiden University Medical Centre.\n\nIn a recent editorial appearing in the , van der Wall lays out the research in support of sauna bathing as a safe and salubrious habit for healthy people of all ages. He also says expert concerns about the safety of sauna bathing for those with heart conditions may be overblown. \u201cDeath in the sauna is a rare event, even in Finland where the frequency of sauna bathing is high,\u201d he writes.\n\nStill, the big questions surrounding sauna bathing\u2019s safety have always centered on its occupant\u2019s (and her heart\u2019s) ability to withstand the heat. Traditional saunas use either wood or electricity to warm the air in a chamber to a temperature of 185 degrees, which many people find unendurable for more than a few minutes.\n\nInfrared saunas, by contrast, do not heat the air around you. Using electromagnetic radiation, infrared lamps warm your body directly. That may sound freaky or even unsafe, but neonatal beds for newborns have long utilized infrared heating elements to ensure babies are kept warm without being stifled.\n\n\u201cAs infrared heat penetrates more deeply than warmed air, users develop a more vigorous sweat at a lower temperature than they would in traditional saunas,\u201d says Dr. Richard Beever, a clinical assistant professor of family medicine at the University of British Columbia.\n\nWhile there\u2019s not a ton of published research looking specifically at infrared saunas, Beever has published a review of all the existing studies he could turn up on the subject. He says there\u2019s evidence to support the use of infrared saunas for high blood pressure, congestive heart failure and chronic pain.\n\nPeople who spent 15 minutes a day for two weeks in an infrared sauna enjoyed a significant drop in blood pressure compared to a control group who spend the same amount of time in a \u201croom-temperature\u201d space, one Japanese study reported. More research found time spent in an infrared sauna could help even out irregular heartbeats, improve scores on physical fitness tests and boost endothelial function in the heart\u2019s vessels.\n\nBeever\u2019s review also looked at some of the other purported health benefits of infrared saunas\u2014including pain management. Among 46 chronic pain sufferers, those who spent time each day in a sauna for four weeks enjoyed a 54% improvement in sleep quality and were 27% more likely to return to work compared to a no-sauna group.\n\nBeever makes it clear all of these reports were based on small groups and require further study. Also, he found no strong evidence of lost weight, improved cholesterol scores or some of the other benefits frequently linked to sauna bathing\u2014infrared or otherwise.\n\nBut he also points out that no accidents or adverse reactions occurred in any of the studies he reviewed. (For men hoping to father children, spending time in hot saunas or baths has long been a no-no. Healthy sperm and heat don\u2019t play well together. Beever says infrared heat may damage sperm as do other forms of heat, but at this point there\u2019s no data on those risks.)\n\nSo what to think of infrared saunas? The existing evidence, though scanty, suggests spending up to 15 minutes a day in one could benefit your heart and ease symptoms associated with chronic pain. And, for now, there don\u2019t seem to be any significant health risks.\n\nAsk your doctor first.

This suggests that including the scans in routine care would not lead to a surge in costly tests or additional heart surgery, the researchers say.\n\nPatients who are at risk of a heart attack are frequently diagnosed with a test called an angiogram. This involves inserting tubes into the body and heart to check the flow of blood and identify any obstructions that could pose a heart attack risk.\n\nCTA scans enable doctors to look at the blood vessels from the outside the body, without the need to insert tubes into the heart. The scans are cheaper, quicker and safer than angiograms.\n\nThe study had previously found that around a quarter of patients had their diagnoses reclassified after receiving the scan, prompting new treatments in many cases.\n\nThis is the first study to look at the impact of the scans on long-term survival rates.\n\nLead researcher Professor David Newby, of the BHF Centre for Cardiovascular Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: \"This relatively simple heart scan ensures that patients get the right treatment.

Keytruda thereby met its main goal of the study.\n\nPatients whose tumors had especially high levels of PD-L1 also went longer without a progression of disease than those taking docetaxel, Merck said.

Julia Belluz will sift through the research and consult with experts in the field to figure out how science can help us live happier and healthier lives.\n\nHave a question? Use our submission form or ask @juliaoftoronto on Twitter.\n\nWhat's the difference between Tylenol, Advil, and aspirin? Which is the best to take for pain?\n\nI used to take acetaminophen (usually referred to by its brand name, Tylenol) for the occasional headache or sore muscle, mostly because that's what we used in my house growing up. I didn't think much about whether it was more or less effective than any other type of over-the-counter pain reliever, and I suspect the same is true for many folks. Acetaminophen, after all, is the most popular over-the-counter painkiller worldwide.\n\nSo I was surprised when I found out there's a huge gap between how pain researchers think about this drug and how the public does. More specifically, every researcher I contacted for this piece said some variation of what Andrew Moore, a pain researcher at Oxford University, told me: Tylenol doesn't actually work that well for pain. To be more exact, he said, \"I can't imagine why anybody would take acetaminophen.\"\n\nMoore has done a number of systematic reviews on over-the-counter pain medications, looking at all the available evidence to figure out which ones work best for various problems. I asked him to describe the overall success rates for the most common three: acetaminophen (like Tylenol), ibuprofen (like Advil), and aspirin.\n\nLike all good evidence-based medicine thinkers, he was able to provide a very practical answer: \"If you\u2019re talking about aspirin in doses of 500 to 1,000 mg or two tablets, 30 percent of people get relief from acute pain. For acetaminophen at doses of 500 to 1,000 mg, about 40 percent have a success. For ibuprofen, in its normal formulation at something around 400 mg or two tablets, about 50 percent have success.\"\n\nNow, Moore was referring here to acute pain that strikes after a specific event, like a surgery, a cut, or a burn, but his message was simple: Ibuprofen seems to work best, followed by acetaminophen, and then aspirin.\n\nFor ongoing (or chronic) pain \u2014 a sore lower back, say, or the kind of degenerative arthritis that typically develops with age \u2014 ibuprofen still outperforms acetaminophen.\n\n\"WE FOUND THAT [TYLENOL] IS INEFFECTIVE ON BOTH PAIN AND DISABILITY OUTCOMES FOR LOW BACK PAIN\" A 2015 systematic review of high-quality evidence, published in the BMJ, found that acetaminophen didn't seem to help most sufferers of chronic low back pain, and that it barely alleviates pain in people with osteoarthritis. As the researchers wrote, \"We found that [acetaminophen] is ineffective on both pain and disability outcomes for low back pain in the immediate and short term and is not clinically superior to placebo on both pain and disability outcomes for osteoarthritis.\"\n\nA limitation of the study is that the evidence on acetaminophen was mainly for acute low back pain, but as the University of Leeds's Philip Conaghan explained, \"There is very little long-term data [on chronic back pain], and if a drug doesn't work in the acute problem, it seems unlikely to work in the chronic phase \u2014 though back pain may be even more complex than osteoarthritis pain.\"\n\nThe study also noted that patients on acetaminophen \"are nearly four times more likely to have abnormal results on liver function tests compared with those taking oral placebo.\"\n\nOther studies, like this well-designed randomized control trial of people with knee pain, have similar conclusions: Acetaminophen doesn't perform as well as ibuprofen, and it's linked to higher rates of liver problems. (Ibuprofen also has potential side effects; more on that below.)\n\nSo what about the occasional headache? What works best for that?\n\nIt turns out this is another fascinating problem area for pain researchers. Moore has looked at all the evidence for what he calls \"infrequent tension headaches\" and found \"it is surprising how poor [the research] is and how little it tells us.\" Either the outcomes in studies are badly defined, the studies have too few participants to say anything concrete, or many people in the studies actually seem to have chronic headaches as opposed to the ordinary ones the researchers are allegedly studying.\n\n\"Most people would say, if you look at the data, take an ibuprofen tablet,\" Moore said. \"Acetaminophen is just not a very good analgesic [pain reliever], yet it\u2019s the go-to drug because it\u2019s thought to be safe.\"\n\nAnd that's where things get even more interesting: Acetaminophen isn't actually that safe.\n\n\"We always thought [acetaminophen] was safe, but there are increasing signals of accidental overdose in people who are regularly using it for chronic pain, and some liver toxicity,\" explained Conaghan, who has studied adverse events data related to this popular drug.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2003, acetaminophen was the leading cause of acute liver failure in the US. There are also hundreds of related deaths every year \u2014 though keep in mind that millions of people take drugs with acetaminophen, so these more extreme side effects are rare (especially if you're only taking them in small doses occasionally). Still, for the drug's minimal pain-killing benefits, the risks may not be worth it. \n\n\n\n\"Don't believe that just because something is over-the-counter, it\u2019s safe,\" Conaghan added. (He advised people to see their doctor if they're taking any of these painkillers for more than a few days \u2014 particularly if they're on other drugs already.)\n\n\"[Tylenol] is an old drug, obsolete, and should be avoided altogether\"\n\nKay Brune, a professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Germany's Friedrich-Alexander University who has also studied the toxicity of painkillers, was even more direct in his thoughts on acetaminophen: \"It's an old drug, obsolete, and should be avoided altogether.\"\n\nAspirin is safer than acetaminophen, he said, though to be used as a pain reliever it requires much higher doses \u2014 which can have side effects like stomach upset. Aspirin also interferes with blood coagulation for days after taking it. \"If you take one gram of aspirin,\" Brune explained, \"you're at risk of bleeding for another four days.\" This is why aspirin has its place as a protective agent against strokes and heart attacks for people at a higher risk.\n\nIbuprofen doesn't have these two problems \u2014 it's less toxic than the others in the doses that give people pain relief. But it has other side effects. \"Ibuprofen puts people at risk of bleeds in the gastrointestinal tract and kidney damage \u2014 so it's not free of risk,\" said Brune. Using it in high doses also seems to raise blood pressure and increase the risk of heart attack and stroke \u2014 one reason the Food and Drug Administration recently warned people should only use ibuprofen (and other \"nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,\" or NSAIDS, like naproxen) for short periods of time and in small amounts.\n\n\n\nI asked Brune about what he'd suggest for the occasional headache or sore muscle. \"Taking 400 mg of ibuprofen won't cause measurable harm,\" he answered. \"Of all drugs we have available, for most indications, it's also the most effective one.\"\n\nIs acetaminophen good for anything?\n\nIf the research community seems to have sided with ibuprofen for pain, is acetaminophen good for anything?\n\n\n\nYes. There are some groups of people with health complications who shouldn't take ibuprofen. For example, patients with kidney, gastric, cardiovascular, or bleeding problems may need to avoid NSAIDS like ibuprofen, so doctors might suggest Tylenol in these cases. \n\n\n\nThere's also some evidence that NSAIDS may increase the risk of psychosis and cognitive impairment in the elderly, so doctors may avoid prescribing these drugs for older patients. And Tylenol is generally considered safer than Advil or aspirin for pregnant women.\n\n\n\nFever is another area where acetaminophen can help, said Moore. According to one systematic review, acetaminophen seems to be safe for treating very young kids with fever, and you can give children as young as 3 months old acetaminophen, whereas you need to wait until kids are at least 6 months old to safely treat them with ibuprofen. This may help to explain the popularity of drugs like Tylenol for kids.\n\nBut a final caveat here: If your child is older than 6 months, it's not all that clear that acetaminophen outperforms ibuprofen for reducing fevers, and the same is true for adults. So keep that in mind the next time you confront your medicine cabinet.\n\nSend your questions to Julia via the submission form or @juliaoftoronto on Twitter.

Both studies are published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology on Dec. 1.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins group reported that psilocybin decreased clinician- and patient-rated depressed mood, anxiety and death anxiety, and increased quality of life, life meaning and optimism. Six months after the final session of treatment, about 80 percent of participants continued to show clinically significant decreases in depressed mood and anxiety, with about 60 percent showing symptom remission into the normal range. Eighty-three percent reported increases in well-being or life satisfaction. Some 67 percent of participants reported the experience as one of the top five meaningful experiences in their lives, and about 70 percent reported the experience as one of the top five spiritually significant lifetime events.\n\n\"The most interesting and remarkable finding is that a single dose of psilocybin, which lasts four to six hours, produced enduring decreases in depression and anxiety symptoms, and this may represent a fascinating new model for treating some psychiatric conditions,\" says Roland Griffiths, Ph.D., professor of behavioral biology in the Departments of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and of Neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. He notes that traditional psychotherapy offered to people with cancer, including behavioral therapy and antidepressants, can take weeks or even months, isn't always effective, and in the case of some drugs, such as benzodiazepines, may have addictive and other troubling side effects.\n\nGriffiths says his team's new study grew out of a decade of research at Johns Hopkins on the effects of psilocybin in healthy volunteers, which found that psilocybin can consistently produce positive changes in mood, behavior and spirituality when administered to carefully screened and prepared participants. The study was designed to see if psilocybin could produce similar results in psychologically distressed cancer patients.\n\n\"A life-threatening cancer diagnosis can be psychologically challenging, with anxiety and depression as very common symptoms,\" says Griffiths. \"People with this kind of existential anxiety often feel hopeless and are worried about the meaning of life and what happens upon death.\"\n\nFor the study, the investigators recruited 51 participants diagnosed with life-threatening cancers, most of which were recurrent or metastatic. They were chosen from a total of 566 individuals reached through flyers, web advertisements and physician referrals. Most participants had breast, upper digestive, GI, genitourinary or blood cancer, and each had been given a formal psychiatric diagnosis, including an anxiety or depressive disorder.\n\nHalf of the participants were female with an average age of 56. Ninety-two percent were white, 4 percent were African-American and 2 percent were Asian.\n\nEach participant had two treatment sessions scheduled five weeks apart, one with a very low psilocybin dose (1 or3 milligrams per 70 kilograms) taken in a capsule and meant to act as a \"control\" placebo because the dose was too low to produce effects. In the other session, participants received a capsule with what is considered a moderate or high dose (22 or 30 milligrams per 70 kilograms).\n\nTo minimize expectancy effects, the participants and the staff members supervising the sessions were told that the participants would receive psilocybin on both sessions, but they did not know that all participants would receive one high and one low dose. Blood pressure and mood were monitored throughout the sessions. Two monitors aided participants during each session, encouraging them to lie down, wear an eye mask, listen to music through headphones and direct their attention on their inner experience. If anxiety or confusion arose, the monitors provided reassurance to the participants.\n\nIn addition to experiencing changes in visual perception, emotions and thinking, most participants reported experiences of psychological insight and often profound, deeply meaningful experiences of the interconnectedness of all people.\n\nThe researchers assessed each participant's mood, attitude about life, behaviors and spirituality with questionnaires and structured interviews before the first session, seven hours after taking the psilocybin, five weeks after each session and six months after the second session. Immediately after the sessions, participants completed questionnaires assessing changes in visual, auditory and body perceptions; feelings of transcendence; changes in mood; and more.\n\nStructured clinical interviews, such as the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and patient questionnaires, like the Beck Depression Inventory and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, assessed depression and anxiety. Other questionnaires assessed quality of life, death acceptance, meaningful existence, optimism and spirituality -- generally defined as a search for the meaning of life and a connection to something bigger than one's self. To measure the changes in attitudes, moods and behavior over time, the researchers administered a questionnaire that assessed negative or positive changes in attitudes about life, mood and behavior.\n\nWith regard to adverse effects, Griffiths says 15 percent of participants were nauseated or vomited, and one-third of participants experienced some psychological discomfort, such as anxiety or paranoia, after taking the higher dose. One-third of the participants had transient increases in blood pressure. A few participants reported headaches following the session.\n\n\"Before beginning the study, it wasn't clear to me that this treatment would be helpful, since cancer patients may experience profound hopelessness in response to their diagnosis, which is often followed by multiple surgeries and prolonged chemotherapy,\" says Griffiths. \"I could imagine that cancer patients would receive psilocybin, look into the existential void and come out even more fearful. However, the positive changes in attitudes, moods and behavior that we documented in healthy volunteers were replicated in cancer patients.\"\n\nUp to 40 percent of people with cancer suffer from a mood disorder, according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.\n\nAnticipating wide interest in the psilocybin research from scientists, clinicians and the public, the journal solicited 11 commentaries to be co-published with the study results written by luminaries in psychiatry, palliative care and drug regulation, including two past presidents of the American Psychiatric Association, a past president of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology, the former deputy director of the U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy, and the former head of the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority. In general, the commentaries were supportive of the research and of using these drugs in a clinical setting as tools for psychiatry.\n\nAdditional authors included Matthew Johnson, Michael Carducci, Annie Umbricht, William Richards, Brian Richards, Mary Cosimano and Margaret Klinedinst, all of The Johns Hopkins University.\n\nThe study was funded by grants from the Heffter Research Institute, the RiverStyx Foundation, William Linton, the Betsy Gordon Foundation, the McCormick family, the Fetzer Institute, George Goldsmith, Ekaterina Malievskaia and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (R01DA03889).", "question": "Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "It is not clear from the release whether psilocybin treatment is currently available, or what the short- or long-term prospects are for psilocybin treatment availability.\nPsylocybin is categorized as a Schedule 1 drug by the Drug Enforcement Administration and its availability is tightly controlled.

Experts now believe that the biological processes behind the neurodegenerative condition begin years, if not decades, before memory problems and confusion become noticeable.\n\nAt the annual Alzheimer\u2019s Association International Conference, researchers say they have found a series of substances in saliva that can distinguish between people who experience normal aging, those with mild cognitive dementia (MCI, which in some cases can lead to Alzheimer\u2019s and in other cases not), and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nPresenting at the meeting, Shraddha Sapkota, a graduate student in neuroscience at University of Alberta, and her colleagues described how they carefully analyzed the saliva of a group of volunteers participating in an aging study. Some had been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s and some with MCI, while others did not have any neurological conditions. By comparing their saliva components, the scientists found that each of the three groups showed slightly different patterns of compounds, which could form the basis of a relatively easy and non-invasive way to determine which people are at higher risk of developing more serious degenerative brain conditions.\n\nThe results aren\u2019t conclusive enough yet for doctors to start using them to distinguish people who are more likely to develop Alzheimer\u2019s, but that\u2019s the goal, says Sapkota. Ideally, for example, isolating those with MCI might help doctors to focus in on a group of patients who might be at higher risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s and therefore might need more intensive and regular testing.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "We give credit here for this acknowledgment: \u201cThe results aren\u2019t conclusive enough yet for doctors to start using them to distinguish people who are more likely to develop Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d However, readers overall may get the impression that the test\u2019s clinical usage is coming soon, when that\u2019s not likely the case.
